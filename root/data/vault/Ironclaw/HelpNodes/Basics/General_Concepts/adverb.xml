    <Log:Description>
       GENERAL CONCEPT: adverbs <br/> <tab/>Most commands allow the use of adverbs to add meaning or characterization to your actions. Adverbs are typically used after a verb, such as $(udat.chatchar)BOW GRACEFULLY, however, they can also be used before the verb as in $(udat.chatchar)GRACEFULLY BOW. <br/> <tab/>Some adverbs, such as SOFTLY and LOUDLY may change the meaning of verbs, in this case, make speaking verbs quieter or have more volume. <br/> <tab/>Typing a partial adverb with a command will display a list of possible adverbs, for instance, $(udat.chatchar)SMILE S. will give all the available adverbs that start with s. If the partial adverb only has one possible result, it will execute the command with that adverb, for example $(udat.chatchar)FROWN GRAVE is the same as typing $(udat.chatchar)FROWN GRAVELY. <br/> <tab/>SEE ALSO: <helplink to="say"/>, <helplink to="whisper"/>, <helplink to="shout"/>
