       {? equal | $(theatre.gameid) | Marrach | <br/>Title: Guard CNPCs<br/> Important Commands: ask<br/><br/> Guards are among the CNPCs (Computer Non-Player Characters) at Castle Marrach. Unlike many of the other CNPCs in Marrach, they're not there to help make sure that food and clothing and scrolls are available to the Guests. Guards are there to keep order.<br/> Obey the rules of propriety and the guards won't bother you. Disobey the rules of propriety and don't be surprised if the guards throw you into your room... or worse. <br/><br/> See Also: CNPCs<br/> | There is no help for '$(keyword)'. }
