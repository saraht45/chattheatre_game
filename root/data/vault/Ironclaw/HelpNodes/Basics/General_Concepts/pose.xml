    <Log:Description>
       <br/>Title: Pose<br/> Important Commands: cower, meditate, pray, sleep, slouch<br/><br/> Even when they're remaining in one place, people are usually doing something. They're often taking a continuing action (like concentrating and meditating). These continuing activities are called poses. Currently a pose is a one-time action seen as others; eventually it will reflect in your look description as well.<br/> Stances are similar to poses; stances are also continuing physical positions, but they tend to be related to details or objects in a room.<br/><br/> See Also: <helplink to="gesture"/>, <helplink to="proximity"/>, <helplink to="stance"/><br/>
