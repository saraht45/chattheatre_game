       <br/>Title: Perception<br/> Important Commands: look, examine<br/><br/> As with real life, it takes work to perceive everything in a location in $(theatre.gamebrief).<br/> You can learn about a room (or a person or an object) by typing $(udat.chatchar)LOOK AT [OBJECT] (or just $(udat.chatchar)LOOK to see the room you're in). This will give you a basic description. For example, $(udat.chatchar)LOOK AT AZRAEL returns "A plain looking person. He is wearing a tunic and a pair of sandals". You can then $(udat.chatchar)LOOK at one of the new details that have been revealed. For example $(udat.chatchar)LOOK AT AZRAEL'S TUNIC returns "An ordinary brown linen tunic".<br/> Whenever you see something interesting, look at it and you'll continue learning more and more.<br/> You can get more information about an object by typing $(udat.chatchar)EXAMINE (for your current room) or $(udat.chatchar)EXAMINE [OBJECT]. Examining takes a little bit of time, and everyone nearby will see what you are doing so. For example $(udat.chatchar)EXAMINE AZRAEL shows: "A plain looking person, with a head, a torso, and two arms and legs. He is wearing a tunic and a pair of sandals." Beware: some people might consider it rude for you to examine them.<br/><br/> See Also: <helplink to="clustering"/>, <helplink to="details"/><br/>
