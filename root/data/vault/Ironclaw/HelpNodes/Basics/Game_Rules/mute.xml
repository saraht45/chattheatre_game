       Title: Mute<br/><br/>StoryGuides have the ability to mute players if they are being disruptive to the game. This is intended to be a merely temporary measure until an understanding can be reached which does not destroy everyone's enjoyment of the game.<br/>When a character is muted, nothing he says will be heard by other players, until a StoryGuide or StoryHost unmutes the character.<br/>(On occasion "mute" is used as a game effect as well, which has nothing to do with disruptive behavior. If you're actually muted by a StoryGuide, as opposed to by some in-game effect, you will see a notice like this: "NOTICE: You have been muted by StoryGuide Rupes.")<br/>You may appeal a StoryGuide action by mailing ce@skotos.net.
