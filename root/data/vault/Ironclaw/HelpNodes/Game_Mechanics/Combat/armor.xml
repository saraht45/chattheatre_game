       COMBAT: armor<br/><tab/>Armor is used in combat for gaining extra defense. Each piece of armor has a certain amount of armor points that add up as you wear them. How many total points you can wear depends on your rank in Armor, both skill and career-given. When you start wearing too much armor for your max armor points, you will start getting an armor penalty, which subtracts from your points.
Unlike articles of clothing, you can only wear one piece of armor that covers a certain body part. For example, cannot wear two different helmets, or two different torso pieces.<br/><tab/>SEE ALSO: <helplink to="combat"/>, <helplink to="injury"/>
