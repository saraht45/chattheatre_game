       <br/>Title: Healer<br/>
Important Commands: Apply, Unbandage, Mix<br/>
Syntax: "Apply my bandage", "Unbandage", "Add"<br/>
<br/>
As a Healer, you have the ability to treat wounds, aid with cures, and tend to people's well-being and physical health.<br/>
To look at a person's injury type $(udat.chatchar)LOOK [PERSON]'S INJURY. To bandage an injured party: $(udat.chatchar)APPLY [BANDAGE] TO [PERSON]'S [BODY PART]. To remove a bandage from someone: $(udat.chatchar)UNBANDAGE [PERSON].<br/>
Bandages will generally gain an unsightly appearance when they need to be changed. Pay attention for that, and then repeat the process above.<br/>
There are also ointments in game that you can purchase, such as burn ointment, cleansing ointment, sleeping drugs, and pain relief drugs.<br/>
You can also create cures by mixing certain items together. For example, to make the zombie cure, you can $(udat.chatchar)ADD [BASIL LEAF] TO [HOLY WATER FLASK]. Talk to other Healers in game to see what your current options are.<br/>
