\|A scantily clad woman slinks through the western portion of the alley, flashing her crooked smile at every man in the vicinity. She sways her hips just-so before slowly wiggling out the center of the common area.
\|You can just make out the gossiping voices of a man in a small group of people, "Ye see tha' lass? Wooh! Wha' I woul'n' give ta.."
\|An inebriated sailor sleeps soundly beneath one of the nearby benches, letting out an occasional snore.

\|An old dirty woman throws you an angry, envious glare before quickly disappearing through a doorway.
\|Rudely, a drunken sailor elbows his way through the nearby crowd.
\|Loudly, an ugly woman curses at the man next to her; she gathers her dirty skirts and leaves through a doorway with a big huff.

\|Two dirty workers saunter through the commons arm-in-arm, singing loudly.
\|Three small kids dressed in rags run screaming through the commons as they fight over a piece of bread.
\|A dirty child quickly snatches a piece of bread from a fat woman's basket and flees through the west alley while she throws curses at him.
