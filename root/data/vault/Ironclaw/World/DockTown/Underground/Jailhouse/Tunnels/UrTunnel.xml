             muddy tunnel
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             This is a dirt tunnel. It seems to have been excavated by hand or very primitive tools. In parts there are small planks of battered wood doing their best to support the structure. The tunnel is not very big, averaging approximately three to four feet in diameter. The size is also not uniform and varies slightly with each step. The ground is covered in almost a foot of dank, dirty, grimy, oily, feces-smelling water. One might regret standing here if they thought about it for too long. The mud oozes underfoot, the water flows erratically to-and-fro, the dirt of the ceiling continously drifts downward, the walls seem to close in.
