\|Loudly, an ugly woman curses at the man next to her; she gathers her dirty skirts and leaves through a doorway with a big huff.
\|A small, dirty child wails and kicks the woman carrying him as they enter a nearby building.
\|Two dirty workers saunter through the commons arm-in-arm, singing loudly.
