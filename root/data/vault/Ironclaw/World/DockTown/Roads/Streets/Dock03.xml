\|A fishwife makes an untidy pile of bones behind her, as she busily tosses the remains of her days catch over her right shoulder.
\|A scantily clad woman slinks through the western portion of the alley, flashing her crooked smile at every man in the vicinity. She sways her hips just-so before slowly wiggling out the center of the common area.

\|Rudely, a drunken sailor elbows his way through the nearby crowd.
\|Loudly, an ugly woman curses at the man next to her; she gathers her dirty skirts and leaves through a doorway with a big huff.
\|A small, dirty child wails and kicks the woman carrying him as they enter a nearby building.
\|Two dirty workers saunter through the commons arm-in-arm, singing loudly.
\|Three small kids dressed in rags run screaming through the commons as they fight over a piece of bread.
