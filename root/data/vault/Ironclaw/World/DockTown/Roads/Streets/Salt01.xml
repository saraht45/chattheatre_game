A dark, eight-legged shape scurries into the shadow of an alley.

A \{woman\|washerwoman\|maid\|servant\} across the way suddenly squeals in terror as a \{large \|small \|tiny \|huge \|\|\}spider lands on her shoulder.

A \{man\|guard\|servant\|slave\} close to you \{suddenly \|quickly \|\}turns and \{swipes\|pulls\|tears\} at an errant spiderweb.

High up in the eves of the buildings, an industrious \{little \|\}\{arachnid\|spider\} \{sleeps\|works carefully on its web\}.

A half-dressed man wearing a religious symbol staggers through the street, followed by a small gathering of people. He lashes his bare back repeatedly while babbling incoherently.
