             A medium sized weighted ball. This hefty ball is roughly 14 inches across and has been crafted from blue leather. It's surprising weight is due to being filled with sand and many small, steel marbles. This ball's primary use is for the building of muscle, and to help build resilience to impact during combat. If you <acmd tag="command" cmd="train leather ball">train</acmd> with this ball, you're sure to be ready for just about any hand to hand attack.
