             "The Basics of Weaponry - Poleaxes<br/><br/> Typically lighter but more awkward weapons, axes perform perfectly when the need is to split through shields or armor. Most of the weight is positioned at the end of the haft, putting more force and momentum directly behind the point of impact.<br/><br/> Poleaxes<br/> Quite a bit more cumbersome than smaller axes, poleaxes combine the fierce armor penetration of their kin with longer range, at the expense of freedom of movement and speed. It is hard for any but the strongest warriors to repeatedly swing a larger poleaxe in melee, but each connecting swing will have deadly results.<br/><br/> Bardiche<br/> The bardiche is a poled axe with a very large, curved axe head from two to three feet in length. The weapon itself only reaches five feet, making the bardiche little more than a very large, unwieldy battle axe.<br/><br/> Long Axe<br/> The long axe is a very efficient weapon for its particular niche. It sports a strong and sharp, yet light and small, head mounted on a four foot pole. Used by a strong warrior, the weighted end can swiftly and fiercely be chopped or swung through even the heaviest armor with relative ease.<br/><br/> Kern Axe<br/> Similar to the bardiche, the kern axe is longer and has a smaller, straighter axe head. With slightly more range and speed, it is a small improvement over the bardiche.<br/>

             "The Basics of Weaponry - Short-hafted Axes<br/><br/> Less awkward than poleaxes, short hafted axes lack the range of polearms and some of the speed of swords, yet they are much more efficient in piercing thick armor and devastating shields.<br/><br/> Bearded Axe<br/> The bearded axe is as much of an innovation as a weapon. The weapon being "bearded" simply means that the blade is wider and lower at the end of the blade than at the base. This allows for the weapon to be gripped behind the blade for more force and presents a larger attacking area without adding much weight. Any larger axe may be bearded, but a "bearded axe" is a favorite of northern sea raiders consisting of a three foot haft and deeply bearded blade.<br/><br/> Broadaxe<br/> The broadaxe is a foresting tool that is occasionally used in combat. One side of the blade is flat while the haft is slanted away from that side, making it rather awkward in striking an opponent, but very efficient in cutting timber.<br/><br/> Handaxe<br/> The handaxe is a simple and small, potentially double-bladed, one-handed axe. It is a very quick, if not maneuverable, weapon.<br/><br/> Hatchet<br/> The hatchet is a unique form of the handaxe. It tends to be lighter and is blunt on the reverse side.<br/><br/> Fokos<br/> A fokos is a long, thin axe primarily used from horseback. The head is very small, allowing it to be swung quickly. Extremely effective from a mount, it also served as a walking stick and hammer when not in combat.<br/>

             The Basics of Weaponry - Blunt Weapons
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             "The Basics of Weaponry - Blunt Weapons<br/><br/> Blunt weapons are fairly new to massed warfare, as a bladed or pointed weapon is much deadlier against bare skin. However, the increase in use of heavy armor gives them the advantage of a broad attack area which forces the victim to take the brunt of the attack, potentially strengthened by the armor, without chance of deflection. Spikes and blade-like protrusions may be included.<br/><br/> Blackjack<br/> The blackjack is a small, thin, and easily concealable club with a small and heavy, usually lead, weight attached to the striking end. The opposite end has a leather strap for ease of carrying and use. Commonly used by thugs and constables, this weapon is often deadly with strikes to the head.<br/><br/> Club<br/> A club is any piece of wood used as a bludgeoning weapon. Any weapon in this broad category that does not fit in a more specific subgroup is simply called a club. Simple, even if effective, bashing is all this primitive weapon is good for.<br/><br/> Flail<br/> Two distinct weapons go by the name flail. The first consists of two long, flat pieces of wood attached by a short chain. The second consists of one or more morningstars attached to a flat piece of wood by a longer chain. Both allow the striking end to spin around a shield or parry to strike an opponent. Due to the wide range of movement required to use effectively, these weapons are ineffective for most infantry. However, these weapons are a cavalry favorite, as the chain stops the impact force from knocking the rider off balance, as is the case with more rigid weapons.<br/><br/> Flanged Mace<br/> The flanged mace is a club attached to a radially symmetric metal head featuring three or more blade-like protrusions. Potentially featuring an apical spike, the flanged mace is most effective in piercing or smashing through armor and shields, while retaining some effectiveness against mounts and lighter armor.<br/><br/> Horseman's Pick<br/> A unique warhammer, the horseman's pick is a long-hafted metal hammer with a reverse spike. It could be used either to smash through helmets to crack skulls or impale lighter armored foes. As the name suggests, the length makes it best used from the back of a mount.<br/><br/> Knobbed Mace<br/> Like the flanged mace, the knobbed mace is a wooden club attached to a metal head. The metal head, however, features round knobs used to smash armor into an opponent. Unfortunately, a strike from this weapon would rarely be fatal and half-dead foes is something to be avoided on the battlefield.<br/>

It could be used either to smash through helmets to crack skulls or impale lighter armored foes. As the name suggests, the length makes it best used from the back of a mount.<br/><br/> Knobbed Mace<br/> Like the flanged mace, the knobbed mace is a wooden club attached to a metal head. The metal head, however, features round knobs used to smash armor into an opponent. Unfortunately, a strike from this weapon would rarely be fatal and half-dead foes is something to be avoided on the battlefield.<br/>

These weapons are much more suited as tools for various menial tasks than actual combat.<br/><br/> Morningstar<br/> A morningstar is an iron ball surrounded by spikes, including an apical spike. Also known as a holy water sprinkler, this weapon exists as a flail or attached to a haft as a spiked club. While effective against light armor, this type of mace loses some of the armor-piercing power of its blunter kin.

The staff is held with the lead hand at the center and the off-hand halfway between the center and one end. Used very similar to a polearm, it can be thrust, swatted, blocked, and struck with. Occasionally it will include metal caps or spikes on one or both ends.<br/><br/> Roundhead<br/> The roundhead is a morningstar with an extended haft. Reaching six feet in length, it is, essentially, a long spiked staff used like most polearms.<br/><br/> Truncheon<br/> The truncheon is a small, thin, and easily concealable club. The opposite held end would have a leather strap for ease of carrying and use. Commonly used by thugs and constables, this weapon is best used to control foes rather than kill them. Wrapping a small and heavy, usually lead, weight to the striking end would make a blackjack, a more dangerous weapon.<br/><br/> Warhammer<br/> A warhammer is a metal hammer of any size, often including a reverse spike.

They can be stored easily and secretly, with few exceptions.<br/><br/> Baselard<br/> A rather long dual-edged dagger, the baselard reaches a foot and a half in length. Its main distinguishing characteristic is the crescent shaped pommel and hilt, which both curve towards the wielder's hand. This makes the dagger slightly more maneuverable, but it is mostly cosmetic. This weapon is typically used by soldiers, mainly pikeman and other large spear users.<br/><br/> Bollock<br/> The bollock dagger is a short duel-edged dagger of northwestern design. Its name originates from two bulbous wooden balls that form its guard, resembling the male body parts of the same name. Often used by western warriors, this dagger provides no advantages over other small blades and its unique guard, usually made of wood, offers less protection.<br/><br/> Cinquedea<br/> The cinquedea is a wide and bulky duel-edged dagger of around two feet that slowly tapers to a rounded point. The name means five-fingers, which is the width of the blade above the guard. Even though it is edged, this dagger is used for thrusting. It is bulky and unwieldy.<br/><br/> Dirk<br/> Another western design, this dual-edged dagger is more of a cross between a sword and a dagger, used for both thrusting and slicing. The dirk is a secondary weapon to a larger sword, is small enough to wear at the waist, and features a wooden hilt with no guard. It reaches two feet in length, but varies a lot under that.<br/><br/> Ear Dagger<br/> A rare dagger, the ear dagger is a thin single-edged dagger with an ear-shaped pommel.

             The Basics of Weaponry - Missile Weapons<br/><br/> In warfare, the ideal situation would be to keep out of the range of an opponent while still being able to deal deadly blows. If you can slay a soldier before he can reach you, that is one less soldier to get the chance to impale you. Using either simple devices or the strength of the arm, missile weapons attempt to somehow launch a weapon at the opponent from afar in hopes to accomplish this.<br/><br/> Sling<br/> Made up of twisted cord with a small pouch at the center, the sling is held at both ends while the bullet, a small stone, is placed in the pouch. The slinger would spin the sling over his head before releasing one end and straightening the arm to launch the bullet. The sling is effective against unarmored opponents, quick and easy to fire, and has a high angled range of near two thousand feet, much farther than almost any bow or crossbow can accurately be fired.<br/><br/> Bows<br/> The bow is a popular missile weapon consisting of a long, thin piece of wood attached to a sturdy string at each end. As the string is drawn backwards towards the wielder, the ends, or limbs, of the bow would strain and store power. When released, the wood and string would snap back into place, launching the missile. The missiles, called arrows, are long and fletched to allow the weapon to be used accurately at a higher angle and range, unlike crossbows, which allows them to be fired over troops and other obstructions with fair accuracy.<br/><br/> Flatbow<br/> The flatbow is a bow constructed from a single, flat, and rectangular piece of wood. Unlike other bows, the flatbow is thinner, deeper, and rounded at the handle while remaining thick and shallow on the limbs. Easy, yet time consuming, to make by hand, these are more common among huntsman and commoners but are rarely seen in large numbers.<br/>

             The Basics of Weaponry - Missile Weapons<br/><br/> Longbow<br/> Roughly the height of the wielder, the longbow is by far the most common bow of the time. The longbow is usually a simple bow, not recurved or composite, made from a single piece of wood. Aside from being easy to make by the common soldier and hunter, the longbow is very effective in war. The size of the bow allows the string to be drawn back to the jaw and released with tremendous power. While taking considerable strength to use well, the longbow can reach an effective range of six hundred feet. Because of its size, the longbow cannot be used on a typical mount.<br/><br/> Shortbow<br/> The shortbow is a more manageable bow of length from two feet to four.

Its range and power varies by its make as it is often a composite of materials, decurved, and recurved.<br/><br/> Decurve<br/> A decurved bow is a bow that has limbs which curve towards the wielder during use. When drawn, the limbs of the bow would be subject to less stress and would be less likely to snap, but would produce less power when released. Longer bows could have this adjustment to allow lighter soldiers to use them well.<br/><br/> Recurve<br/> A recurved bow, the opposite of a decurved bow, is a bow in which the limbs curve away from the wielder at the tips. When drawn, the limbs would be strained more and would produce more power on release. This allows smaller bows to produce range and power to equal their longer counterparts without requiring the same space. These adjustments are most often found on shorter cavalry bows.<br/>

             The Basics of Weaponry - Missile Weapons Continued<br/><br/> Crossbows<br/> The crossbow is an unique type of missile weapon consisting of a bow laid horizontally atop a stock. The drawstring would be drawn back along the stock in various ways and held in place while a projectile, usually a bolt, is inserted. The crossbow would then be aimed and fired. Unlike bows, crossbows could be kept drawn without straining the user. They were significantly more powerful, easily piercing even heavy armor at short range, but are typically smaller with lower accurate range than other ranged weapons.<br/><br/> Arbalest<br/> The arbalest is a much larger, more powerful version of the hand-held crossbow. The arbalest almost always uses a cranequin or windlass crank due to its large size and use of a less flexible steel bow. The result, after cranked fully, is a crossbow that can fire accurately and with deadly force to near sixteen hundred feet.<br/><br/> Lockbow<br/> The lockbow is a more primitive, northern crossbow. The drawstring is pulled, by hand, back into a groove. To fire, the lockbow utilizes a wooden peg struck through the stock and groove and attached to a lever under the weapon. When forced upward, the peg would dislodge the drawstring and fire the ammunition. A very weak crossbow, it would only reach an effective range of a hundred and forty feet.<br/><br/> Cranequin<br/> The cranequin is a device to ease the drawing of larger crossbows. The middle of the drawstring is attached to a long rod, or rack, with many indentions. A primitive pinion wheel was fitted into the rack. When cranked, the pinion wheel would force the rack up the stock and pull the drawstring in the process. This allows for large and powerful crossbows to be drawn gradually, to not exhaust the bowman.<br/><br/> Windlass<br/> The windlass is another type of crank device used to ease the drawing of larger crossbows. Instead of a rack, the windlass utilizes a barrel in which a hooked rope is attached. When the barrel is spun with one or two cranks, the rope pulls the drawstring back into position.<br/>

             The Basics of Weaponry - Gunpowder Weapons<br/><br/> Hailing from the west, gunpowder weapons are quickly becoming dreaded on the battlefield. With a loud boom, these weapons pelt troops at extremely long range and pierce even the heaviest armor from a shorter range.<br/><br/> Arquebus<br/> The first of the long-barreled firearms, the arquebus is the smaller predecessor of the musket. The arquebus fires small muzzle-loaded lead balls at a low speed. Effective at punching through armor at short range, it is not very accurate or deadly at any longer range. It utilized a matchlock, unlike the older hand cannons.<br/><br/> Blunderbuss<br/> The blunderbuss is a unique firearm that has a shorter, wider barrel that flares at the end. It is muzzle-loaded with many smaller lead balls. Upon firing, the lead balls would explode from the muzzle and cause massive damage on a wide area. Not very effective against armored troops, this weapon is often used by cavalry to slaughter lightly armored infantry. A smaller, one-handed version is known as the dragon.<br/><br/> Culverin<br/> The culverin is a slightly more advanced form of long-barreled firearm that consisted of a straight, thin tube that used small, muzzle-loaded lead balls. Unlike the arquebus, the culverin fires its balls at a very high speed. This gifts it with very long range at a low angle, but it is not always extremely accurate. The culverin is held under the arm and fired with a touchhole.<br/><br/> Hand Cannon<br/> A very primitive firearm, the hand cannon appears as a small siege cannon held in the hand or mounted upon a pole. The hand cannon is loaded with large lead balls that are fired with a touchhole. Larger versions can be tucked under the arm or dug into the ground for easier firing.<br/>

             The Basics of Weaponry - Polearms<br/><br/>From antiquity to the present day, the polearm has been the king of the battlefield. Only a fool would debate this. Even now, as gunpowder begins to shadow its majesty, the pike, halberd, and lance stand in the fore of any well-fitted army.<br/><br/> Polearms, as a whole, fall into two distinct categories. There are the spear-type polearms and the true polearms. Although appearances may be deceiving, there is never any ambiguity.

A true polearm adds the ability to slash, chop, drag, or perform other more complex maneuvers.<br/><br/>Spears<br/>Spears are the ancestors of all polearms, and the most common of all weapons. They are some of the most favored of weapons for anyone from farmers to organized militaries. They are cheap to make, requiring little more than a sharp point and length of wood, yet they are surprisingly effective in war. The fact that they require little movement to thrust allows them to be used, with shields, in much tighter formations than many other weapons. This in combination with their superior length gives them a massive advantage against most alternative weapons. However, if a spear wall is broken, the spear's encumbrance shows and it is quickly abandoned for a smaller sidearm.<br/><br/>Awl Pike (Ahlspeiss)<br/>The awl pike is a fairly unique spear with a very large head. Its shaft measures around five feet with a three foot head attached. It is held far up the shaft, with the lead hand just behind the head usually protected by a circular plate, or rondel. Although this spear lacks real length, it can be used in tight spaces and allows a wielder to give an extremely powerful thrust. The awl pike is mediocre in formation fighting, but excels after a melee breaks out.

          <Base:Description type="look">
             The Basics of Weaponry - Polearms Continued<br/><br/> True Polearms<br/><br/> True polearms are those polearms that are meant to be slashed, chopped, hooked, or attacked with in various ways other than simple thrusts. True polearms are very useful in loose melee or single combat due to this versatility, the exact opposite of their spear cousins.<br/><br/> Billhook<br/> The billhook is a polearm weapon mounted by a thick, hooked blade. A billhook's primary use is for dismounting mounted opponents, though it can be chopped and sliced with. A forwardly positioned reverse spike is often included, making the weapon a bill-guisarme. This reverse spike allows it to be thrust to a very limited extent.<br/><br/> Glaive<br/> A simple glaive consists of a curved, single-edged blade mounted on a sturdy pole. The glaive, like other true polearms, is very effective in single combat and loose melee. Its blade comes to a point, allowing it to be thrust, sliced, and chopped. A reverse hook may be added to form a glaive-guisarme, allowing it to dismount riders with more ease.<br/><br/> Guisarme<br/> A guisarme resembles a long-headed spear with a large hook attached to one side. It is a primitive farmer-invented weapon used to dismount riders. Its basic form has been built into several other more effective and popular polearms, such as variants of the glaive, voulge, and billhook.<br/><br/> Halberd<br/> The halberd's haft sports a pointed head including a large forward axe-head and reverse spike. Significantly shorter than other similar polearms, the halberd is easier to handle and much deadlier in loose melee and single combat. Its versatile attack points and smaller size allowed it to be swung, chopped, thrust, and grappled with ease. Halberds also normally included metal rims to reinforce the haft, allowing it to easily block bladed weapons in melee.<br/>

             The Basics of Weaponry - Polearms Continued<br/><br/> True Polearms<br/><br/> True polearms are those polearms that are meant to be slashed, chopped, hooked, or attacked with in various ways other than simple thrusts. True polearms are very useful in loose melee or single combat due to this versatility, the exact opposite of their spear cousins.<br/><br/> Billhook<br/> The billhook is a polearm weapon mounted by a thick, hooked blade. A billhook's primary use is for dismounting mounted opponents, though it can be chopped and sliced with. A forwardly positioned reverse spike is often included, making the weapon a bill-guisarme. This reverse spike allows it to be thrust to a very limited extent.<br/><br/> Glaive<br/> A simple glaive consists of a curved, single-edged blade mounted on a sturdy pole. The glaive, like other true polearms, is very effective in single combat and loose melee. Its blade comes to a point, allowing it to be thrust, sliced, and chopped. A reverse hook may be added to form a glaive-guisarme, allowing it to dismount riders with more ease.<br/><br/> Guisarme<br/> A guisarme resembles a long-headed spear with a large hook attached to one side. It is a primitive farmer-invented weapon used to dismount riders. Its basic form has been built into several other more effective and popular polearms, such as variants of the glaive, voulge, and billhook.<br/><br/> Halberd<br/> The halberd's haft sports a pointed head including a large forward axe-head and reverse spike. Significantly shorter than other similar polearms, the halberd is easier to handle and much deadlier in loose melee and single combat. Its versatile attack points and smaller size allowed it to be swung, chopped, thrust, and grappled with ease. Halberds also normally included metal rims to reinforce the haft, allowing it to easily block bladed weapons in melee.<br/>

             The Basics of Weaponry - Polearms Contined<br/><br/>Boar Spear (Broad-bladed Spear)<br/>The boar spear is a relatively short and sturdy spear useful both for game hunting and warfare. This spear sports a wide leafed blade with two lugs set at its base. This design allows it to penetrate and hold an aggressive opponent, while allowing the wielder to easily dislodge himself if needed. Originally used to hold raging game lizards at bay, it also has use with cavalry. Often enough with other spears, slaying the mount could result in its collapsing weight snapping the haft of weapon. The boar spear, however, can quickly be retracted allowing the wielder to continue fighting without a sidearm.<br/><br/>Cavalry Lance<br/>The cavalry lance comes in two dominate forms. The first is a typical one-handed light spear used for thrusting. The haft sported a round plate to stop the hand from sliding upon striking. The second form is a much longer and thicker spear designed to be held under the armpit, or couched, and leveled at the enemy during a charge. These couched lances could either be made of light wood designed to shatter on impact, still dealing a devastating blow while not desaddling the wielder, or of sturdier material with a blunt point. The latter would attempt to hurl infantrymen and riders into their comrades, breaking up formations, but could also throw an inexperienced rider from his seat and is much more dangerous.<br/><br/>Leaf-bladed Spear<br/>More of a type of spearhead than a unique spear, the leaf-bladed spear is a one-handed variant of the spear with a head that widens near the base before tapering to a triangular point, as the shape of a leaf.<br/><br/>Military Fork<br/>Vaguely resembling a pitchfork, the military fork is a spear sporting two parallel tines, usually flared outward. These weapons are not the most efficient in melee, but perform adequately and have numerous additional uses. On the open field, they both present a larger, yet light, striking end making it much harder to miss completely and serve well in dismounting or skewering cavalry. In sieges and against enemy artillery positions, they are very effective both in dismantling defensive obstacles while they are effective at halting siege ladders and towers on the defense. They also had numerous utilitarian uses outside of the battle, as just reinforced pitchforks.<br/>

             The Basics of Weaponry - Polearms Contined<br/><br/>Pike<br/>Typically little more than an extremely long spear, the pike has made itself the mainstay weapon for several militaries. A pike would usually be around ten to thirteen feet, but may stretch past twenty. The length disallows the pikeman any use of a large shield or special maneuvering. It should be noted that a pike can be planted in the ground to halt cavalry without great recoil. This weapon finds itself only effective in tight and well-trained formations. In the hands of inexperienced troops, it stands as nothing but a defensive spear wall with the advantage of length. With proper training, pikeman can march and thrust by drum-beat, allowing them to form a devastating and mobile wall.<br/><br/>Ranseur<br/>The ranseur is a longer one-handed spear with a thick, triangular blade. Just below the blade would be a cross-hilt, allowing opposing weapons to be trapped between the two. Used two-handedly, a twist of the weapon during entrapment would result in either a break or disarming of the opponent's weapon. Unlike the boar spear, the triangular blade can get caught, making it harder to retract the weapon on a particularly harsh thrust.<br/><br/>Spetum<br/>The spetum is a longer two-handed spear sporting a wide blade with two diagonal projections at its base. The fore faces of each projection are bladed. The spetum's additional blades present a much larger area of attack, allowing the wielder to attack in various ways that would be a reckless waste of movement with most other spears. For example, the spetum is often used to slice the ankles, severe the hand, or skewer the throat of a mobile opponent.<br/><br/>Trident<br/>The trident is a three-pronged spear used both for fishing and warfare. Very similar to the military fork in use, there are a few distinct differences. The trident is much less useful for several utilitarian purposes, as the third prong tends to be a hindrance.

             The Basics of Weaponry - Long Swords<br/><br/>Longer swords, as their name suggests, long swords usually include a double-edge blade exceeding three and a half feet mounted on a simple cruciform hilt. They are typically held and swung with both hands. Too long to be worn in any waist scabbard, baldrics are used to hold these swords to the back, with scabbard or not.<br/><br/>Bastard Sword<br/>The bastard sword gets its name from its odd size. Somewhere between a longsword and a shorter sword, the bastard sword's hilt is not large enough to fully accommodate two hands, yet is usually used with two. The off-hand can either be placed over the pommel for extra leverage in a swing or longer thrust, or the leather-clad hand can grip the base of the blade, to put more force and control into short slices and jabs. The weapon, hilt and blade, would reach near five feet.<br/><br/>Claymore<br/>A favorite of western warriors, the claymore is a relatively short and wide-bladed two handed sword. Short and maneuverable enough to be swung easily, it could serve well in loose melee.<br/><br/>Estoc<br/>The Estoc, a variation of the longsword, is a two-handed sword focused completely on combating heavily armored opponents wearing mail or plate armor. It consists of a long, straight, and stiff blade with no cutting edge that tapered to a very acute and viciously sharp point. As armor began to improve to plating, cutting weapons such as swords became less effective on the battlefield. Crushing and splitting weapons suchs as axes, maces and the like were employed. Thrusting weapons, such as long tapered swords, were used to pierce mail and bypass the joints of plate.<br/><br/>Zweihander<br/>The zweihander is a massive, seven foot northeastern sword. Often used as the vanguard of infantry companies, it is most often used for hacking through spear walls before approach.

          <Base:Description type="look">
             The Basics of Weaponry - Fencing Swords<br/><br/>Lighter, more agile weapons, fencing swords are an attempt to provide protection to the richer, and Noble, classes. Most commonly found amongst gentry, they were both used as jewelry as dueling weapons to settle personal disputes. As dueling became the most popular way to settle such disputes, fencing has become more and more fashionable.<br/><br/>Colichemarde<br/>The colichemarde is a popular descendent of the rapier. Its interesting shape, consisting of a wider forte with fullers, allows for better parrying and thrusting abilities. As a result of the wider forte, bringing the center of weight closer to the hand, the blade was swifter and easier to control. Despite its intended function as a defensive weapon, it shows great offensive abilities as well.<br/><br/>Epee<br/>The epee is a thin, light, dull fencing sword with a triangular cross-section. Born from the desire to reduce deaths in duels, the small epee is meant to be used to the first blood and requires great skill and dexterity to use well, as a nick to an extremity would end the duel. Large guards are often added to shield the hand from such a nick. A recent invention, the epee is not yet a common weapon. The epee reaches three and a half feet.<br/><br/>Foil<br/>Very similar to the epee, the foil is even thinner and lighter. The foil is usually blunt at the tip and will bend on impact. This allows for the wielders to practice, or compete, without risk of damaging the opponent. A very new tool, the foil is rarely seen or used. The foil should reach around three feet.

             The Basics of Weaponry - Fencing Swords Continued<br/><br/>Rapier<br/>The rapier is a somewhat slender, pointed sword used mainly for thrusting attacks. It is bladed, but not very sturdy, only allowing very limited slashing. The hilts are usually  complex and provide ideal protection. Most of the hilts used have a delicate, sweeping guard, consisting of an intricate network of bars, ending with a fat pommel to provide balance to the long blade.The strength of the rapier is in its ability as a rapid thrusting weapon, capable of delivering deep, precise punctures without much effort. The rapier had many forms. The blade itself could be sharpened from base to tip, from halfway up the blade to the tip, or could be left entirely blunt. The rapier is divided into many parts, depending on the particular discipline of the wielder. The forte is the part of the half of the blade closest to the hilt, and is the thickest part of the sword. The debole is the other half of the blade, including the point, and is weaker and more flexible. Some disciplines divide the blade into three parts, adding a section between the forte and debole. This section is called the medio or the terzo. The rapier is the weapon of choice in dueling and sportive fencing. The rapier has become extremely fashionable amongst gentry, and the wealthier classes. Known as the father of fencing, it is the most primitive and cumbersome of the dueling weaponry.<br/><br/>Sabre<br/>The sabre is a longer, single or dual-edged cavalry sword. While usually single-edged and curved, meant for slashing, many are straightened and dual-edged to better allow thrusting as well. Ideal for slicing through lighter foot soldiers, the sabre has become less effective with the advent of heavier armor. Instead, it is most commonly seen both as a sailor's weapon and as the regalia of commanding officers, often tasseled and sporting intricate hilts.<br/><br/>Smallsword<br/>The first descendent of the rapier, the smallsword is shorter and lighter allowing it to be used with more speed and agility. Most common as jewelry or regalia, even more so than the rapier and sabre, it can be a very effective dueling weapon in the right hands.

          <Base:Description type="look">
             The Basics of Weaponry - Exotic Weapons<br/><br/>Cesti<br/>Some pugilists choose to reinforce their punch with something extra. The most primitive form of this is the cesti, simple metal plates placed on the knuckles and secured into place with cloth wrappings, usually made of linen. Very easy to use, the cesti place all the force of a punch onto a small, solid area, inflicting much more damage on impact.<br/><br/>Bladed Cesti<br/>Much more professional and dangerous than simple cesti, bladed cesti can be made by inserting a single, thin sword blade into the back of a leather gauntlet. Riveted in place, it becomes a deadly, easily used weapon. Self-inflicted injury by novice users is common, however.<br/><br/>Caltrop<br/>Caltrops are a simple weapon made of two pieces of thick, twisted wire formed into four points. They are shaped so that at any given time, three points will form a tripod while the fourth will point straight up. These are very useful when thrown before a defensive formation, or just before a melee, as they will slow or injure any advancing enemies.<br/><br/>Man Catcher<br/>A non-lethal pole weapon that ends in a circular cage. The very end holds two metal flaps that act as a gate, allowing a victim to enter the cage but disallowing exit. Containing spikes within the circular cage, the man catcher is expected to be used on only an armored opponent, typically someone worth a ransom. It will heavily wound or kill anyone who is not wearing the proper protection.
