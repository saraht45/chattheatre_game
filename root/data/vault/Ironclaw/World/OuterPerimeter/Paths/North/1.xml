             This section of road stretches from northeast to southwest. Stone walls enclose the road on either side. Tufts of grass edge the dirt path with the occasional grassy island in the center. Upon closer inspection, you can make out a farm, complete with a courtyard and well far to the northeast, and a massive iron portcullis dominates the the wall surrounding Triskellian.
