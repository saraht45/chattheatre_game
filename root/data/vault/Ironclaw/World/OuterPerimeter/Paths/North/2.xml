             This section of road stretches from northwest to southeast. Stone walls enclose the road on either side. Tufts of grass edge the dirt path with the occasional grassy island in the center. Upon closer inspection, you can make out a farm, complete with a courtyard and well far to the northwest. A river is seen to the left of the path, or what used to be a river.  it's turned into a swampy pond and there appears to be a dam...one made out of the bodies of farmers.
