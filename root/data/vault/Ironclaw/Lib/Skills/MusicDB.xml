 * Building Emits for Solos and Groups.  
 *  
 * Emits are simple strings of text. You may not directly apply code or search for properties or traits.  
 * If you desire a particular piece of code or property search, ask a coder.  
 * A decent coder can go into Ironclaw:Lib:Skills:Music "merry:lib:play_replace_strings"  
 * and would understand how to accomplish the task.  
 * If you are unsure, don't try. It may break the system for everyone.  
 *  
 * Emits use a replacement script. Basically, certain CAPPED words produce different results.  
 * Currently, the possible replacements are as follows:  
 *  
 * FOR SOLO EMITS:  
 * ACTOR will describe the actor ie "StoryCoder Azrael".  
 * INSTRUMENT will describe the instrument sans ownership ie "a white oak ocarina".  
 * TOOL will emit an imaginary tool based on instrument which is used to play it ie "drumstick".  
 * VERB will pick a random verb based on instrument type and allows for 1st and 3rd person ie "strum".  
 * POSSESSIVE will result in the correct possessive pronoun ie "his, hers, your".  
 * QUALITY will result in an adjective based on actor's skill ie "capably".  
 * ENVIRONMENT will describe the actor's environment ie "the West Commons".  
 * STYLE will result in a description of the emotional style ie "sadness".  
 *  
 * FOR GROUP EMITS:  
 * GROUP will describe the group in three possible ways ie "The musical group", "Death, Azrael, and Roo".  
 * QUALITY will result in an adjective based on leader's skill ie "capably".  
 * VERB will pick a random generic group verb not based on a single instrument ie "harmonizes".  
 * POSSESSIVE will result in the correct possessive pronoun for a group ie "their".  
 * ENVIRONMENT will describe the group's environment ie "the West Commons".  
 * STYLE will result in a description of the emotional style ie "sadness".  
 *

 * About Styles of Music 
 * 
 * Styles represent a sense of feeling portrayed in music. 
 * They -cannot- force a quality ie awesomely, skillfully.
