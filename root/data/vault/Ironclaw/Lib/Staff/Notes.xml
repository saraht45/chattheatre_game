         "May 23 09:01 StoryGoddess Eos, \\"Just to get all on the same page. Jalal bin Tawfiq is -one- trader/merchant in Akoma which is a continent comparable to Africa, so a huge area. In general, Sailors can import things from Akoma via the auction house, as they're dealing with all the pirates and stuff around the world. As for Jalal, there has in the past been several plots and stories involving him, starting with Anelie of the Doloreaux dressing up Chesh, Althea and others to look like Bisclavret. They sailed to Akoma to meet with Jalal and tried to disrupt trade to Triskellian and so on. A larger plot came of that and the Rinaldi sailed there several times. A year or two ago Jalal was in Triskellian, and he has some ties to the Rinaldi embassy as a whole. Ravenna spent several months at Jalal's place as a \\"guest\\" (hostage to guarantee Rinaldi promises) when the Rin bargained with Jalal to make him stop trading with the Jadelanders, while those back in Triskellian made sure Jalal got gunpowder and cannons (cannons provided by the Bisc, gunpowder by the Rinaldi - the Dolo were all paranoid about Jalal getting things like that). Tied into that there were some issues with the Sailors, as (one of Artemis' characters I can't recall the name of right now) had promised to go to Jalal's to teach them how to use guns and stuff, and when the time came for her to go, she was in the Sailors and the Sailors got all upset about it. So in short, Jalal is an Akoma VP, whom the Rinaldi has some ties to, but who can be contacted by anyone. He is a merchant, but he's far from the only merchant in Akoma. Jalal can be visited for plots (and has been several times, latest was when Virendra went to jungle Akoma to get slaves), and he can be invited to the city. This doesn't mean he provides any direct imports or anything, it's solely per plot basis. The auction house imports from Akoma is still and has always  been the Sailors due to their general connections to Akoma and people trading with Akoma. I hope this is clear, otherwise feel free to poke me and I'll try to explain things better. Cheers.\\""

This took them about 40 minutes to diagnose and a bit longer to restore. ------  Much more astonishingly, they rebooted all of their machines (which means all of our machines) while they were fixing the problem, with no notice. This probably had minimal repercussions on the SkotOS games (Marrach, Ironclaw, Lazarus, and Lovecraft). There may have been a rollback of an hour or two.  ------------- TEC and Grendel's Revenge are more troublesome. TEC will suffer a rollback of 10 hours, to midnight (PT) last night, since the unannounced reboot happened one hour before the next backups. GR suffered a more complete failure. We're being forced to restore the entire machine from its backups, then we'll need to restore the game from the backups stored within that backup. The lineup of dates look promising (which is how we laid them out, 'lo these many years ago), so the hope is that we'll only suffer a 7 hour rollback, to the 3am (PT) game backup, but it's a bit dicey at the moment.  ------ Apologies for the inconvenience; we're now making sure everything is stable, and we're looking into whether our most recent upgrades to TEC will support increasing the backups to every 6 hours. ------- Edit: The GR problem is proving even more intractable than hoped. As best I can tell, our colo is still having some issues because I can't boot the first restore I made of GR and I can't build a new node either. I expect this will just clear when they get their act together, but in the meantime I'm not able to get GR back online until they fix these problems.\\""

I noticed an oddity in the swamps (as I hadn't been fishing since the changes,) where my resultant rolls were between 2 and 9, and I never caught the fish corrolating to result 1 or 10-12. Also fishing by hand seemed to get the same results as a pole. Now trying it in the city, I am getting the same. When fishing off a pier I get an even more restricted result. The fisharray on the piers has only 7 possible results and I only can get the middle ones. 2-4. Not 1 or 5-7. Also the timing of fishing is much different. For me its much slower now, but I'm told Meepers can cast a net out every 8 seconds or so which seems odd. Might need to fix or disable fishing as the changed system is clearly not working.

         "Jan 14 02:07 StoryHost Azrael, \\"'+opage ian 'Ok, I did some digging about the Doloreaux (I knew I wasn't crazy when saying that they'd converted)... let me first point you to what I dug up, and then discuss how we should probably handle Lutarism in the city. Of course, page or email me to chat about this... Anyway... check out this forum thread: http://forum.skotos.net/showthread.php?t=52274 - have a look almost halfway down for the heading \\"A Brief History\\" - it talks about how the Rinaldi converted to S'allumer on the day of Helloise's death. \\"They were soon to be followed by the Bisclavret and the Avoirdupois royal houses. The Doloreaux royals accepted the radiance only recently.\\" - one of the four Archdukes of S'allumer is assigned to the Doloreaux as well. So, yeah, that was posted back in '06, it's not new information. Right beneath it, however, is a section titled \\"A Wise and Generious Doloreaux\\" which gives the other side of the story. It's a short story about someone who visits a Doloreaux noble and discovers \\"certain references to a series of holiday festivals still practiced in the heart of the Doloreaux homelands\\" then \\"as I leafed through its yellowed pages, the realization dawned that this could only be an account detailing the practice of the Doloreaux's secretive religion\\". It takes him a day to muster the courage to ask about the current practices of the Old Faith. So it's a big deal to even talk about Lutarism (since Lutarism is a heresy according to the Church of S'allumer). - I think what we can read from this, and also knowing the Doloreaux stubborn natures, is that they needed to accept S'allumer so they could \\"get by\\" with the other houses, benefit from trade in Triskellian etc. but they are stubborn enough to keep worshipping their old religion in secret. Even without any pressure from the S'allumer crowd Lutarism is a very secretive religion, and wouldn't normally be spoken about openly. It is probably a reasonable guess that Archduke Tremaine (leader of the Doloreaux) is still a Lutarist - although it would be a dangerous move to claim that out loud. There are other references to the church trying to raise money to build more S'allumer churches in Doloreaux land, and that being blocked by the Lutarists, and many S'allumer priests or missionaries in the north have gone missing - so they are certainly still a formidable force up north (even if not openly acknowledged). Anyway, the upshot is that there is no problem with any Doloreaux character being a firm supporter of Lutara, but it's probably not a smart move to be too vocal about it, both because of the accusations of heresy, and because the religion itself is secretive. Any questions, or if you want to discuss this, or have another interpretation, feel free to page me or mail me. We're trying to stick with the cannon information here as much as possible.

CE tells me that they don't want to be in a position to second-guess the host, since we know what's going on in the game, and they don't. So they've asked that we change the policy. Now the escalation goes staffer -\> lead -\> host. With the host being the end of the line. If they don't like my decision, they can suck an egg.

That is the major difference between houses and guilds. Houses belong to the house and the PC leading it only represents the house. And if you dislike it, you can not go and just make a new house. However guilds belong to the PCs who own them. So if they want to sell it, give it away or desert it? They can. We should not interfere with it. Especially as anyone in the guild can make a new guild easily and start their very own business. So when people ask for being set as owner, it should always be the owner filing that request.

I've also made some (minor) tweaks to how it's calculated. Now it requires current rank + 7 to go up a level (so higher ranks need more favor) and if you go below -10 favor, you get warned that you're at risk of demotion. Then you have a month where you're \\"safe\\" and after that month if your favor goes below -20 you get demoted. (If you can get your favor back to 0 or above, the warning goes away. And next time you drop to -10 you get a new warning, and a new month of safety. This means that PCs can do that \\"big thing\\" that gets them lots of disfavor, without getting demoted.

So it's certainly been established over the years, by former staffers, that Old is the language of the Rinaldi nobles, and not Southern. From a historical point of view, this makes sense. The Rinaldi were the first on Calabria and would have brought Old with them back in the day. So it'd make sense they still speak it. Southern on the other hand -can- be a regional dialect/language coming from old that the peasants and commoners would use among themselves, especially those removed from Triskellian and the Rinaldi nobles. Which would also explain why the Rin nobles doesn't speak Southern, as why should they bother learn the bastardized language of the rabble. Just a few observations seeing there's the discussion on the forums currently about Old vs Southern. I personally never have heard that Rin nobles should speak Southern, but rather that they'd always speak Old if they're to be considered being anything, and from what I recall, it's also what VPs like Mercutio would speak when speaking to peers.\\""

Resurrection is basically this: a white mage performs a ritual on a person, who wants to reutrn to life and S'Allumer permits it. So it is unavoidable that a white mage is involved in the process, even if he waits out the 2 weeks. The fact that he returns to life will be proof that S'Allumer accepts him, so there should be some cleansing involved or somethign or lore system wise issues might arise. Unless you return him with black magic, which however is a consent to permadeath (I can tell you more how Dio had his own faith there). I say no to his return as a ghost. Were it Halloween, I would allow all the dead people to walk the town, but since it is not, I would say no. I wouldn't disagree with a plot that makes him return as a ghost. But then this is the final say of his. So as a good bye plot: haunt Triskellian, and then get exorcised and leave with the character for ever, find your peace... such a plot I would agree to.

It'd be quite a job to clean all the rumours of it (and a shame if it gets lost as there's game-lore/history hidden in it) and put it on the forums. Due to the naming system of the rumours/favours, it should be possible to pull either out and perhaps add a comment the beggar says. Like before a rumour, he could say: \\"I heard a rumour:\\" or/and before favors something like \\"I heard this was a favour:\\" or whatever wording. Making it clear what it is he says. I do understand the desire to have the separated because players end up being pissed because they think a false rumour is a reason they get disfavoured etc. But the question is also, doesn't it encourage RP to find out if it's a true rumour or a false one?\\""

Thus the Avoir and Dolo got 6 each, the Bisc got 9, and the Rinaldi got 12.. We need to speak to the leadership of the Houses OOC to lay out the expectations their own superiors have for how the 'land is distributed'. Specifically, the tokens and promotions are supposed to be spread out over as many PCs as possible and ideally saved rather than spent at once. That means we will absolutely not be allowing 3 or more tokens to be spent on a single character. Single tokens are recommended for anyone who has been a member for \< 4 months, or has been promoted within the last 4 months or so. 2 tokens will be the most we'll be allowing, and then only for well established chars in the House who haven't received any promotions for a while.
