I hope we will be able to pinpoint the real issues behind the assists.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou suppose, \\"First lets go over OOC, and then we can look to IC.\\"\\r\\nEsquire Mathias nods to you easily, \\"From an OOC stand point - More than anything it's just a change. When I originally bought him I intended for him to stay with politics and he did for a good while. Training under Bayard, Captaining the Guard, usual political spats, political engagement, etc. Over time he changed and grew into his own personality. He doesn't do politics. He doesn't work the connections that he should like my other character (who is a commoner) does. He's more a commoner than he is an individual of rank. I think it would be a good change for his story and a better way to find direction with him.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Are you wanting to go all the way back to Freeborn or just one rank or two or ??\\"\\r\\nEsquire Mathias hrms to you, \\"I was thinking freeborn. Simple commoner. Free to do as he pleases for the most part, take up a craft, be productive. He has an IC foundation for the why's and so on. Let him re-earn it if someone found him worthy of a higher position.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou nod somewhat, \\"Are tehere any particular frustrations you feel from being gentry? We've had gentry make their way that way.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou say, \\"Meepers who built herself up and is a crafters, Dasha as well.\\"\\r\\nYou suspect, \\"Most didn't even know Dasha was gentry probably.. she didn't make it very public IC.\\"\\r\\nEsquire Mathias admits to you, \\"I don't know a Dasha unless you mea Dahlia.\\"\\r\\nEsquire Mathias tells you then, \\"No. OOC, I've no true frustrations with it.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"A Rinaldi gentry. Was a guard in town for another guild.\\"\\r\\nEsquire Mathias nods to you then, \\"Ah. Well I don't know the character.\\"\\r\\nYou ask, \\"Is there any reason to not just have him leave the embassy and go pursue his own life as a gentry?\\"\\r\\nEsquire Mathias hrms at you subtly, \\"I didn't know he can leave and keep his title. -- And, yes, I don't want him to have his title/rank. That's the point. It's not that he's Avoirdupois at all. It's his position in life.\\"\\r\\nEsquire Mathias corrects himself idly, \\"Could not can. I'm having a bad day grammatically speaking. XD.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou say, \\"So ou want him to have a trauma/fall from status as part of his story? Because the House guild/embassy is just an out of game construct. A gentry is just a person with lands and certain status. They can still go out and do most things others do. It might hamper their advancement. Take Meepers who hasn't been made knight after many years because she's doing trade work, but she can do it.\\"\\r\\nYou explain, \\"I'm not sayin no. I'm just trying to understand what you are wanting to accomplish.\\"\\r\\nEsquire Mathias wonders to you, \\"Do you want me to explain the IC foundation behind his wanting to renounce his titles? It might make more sense if I did. It's not a traumatic fall if it's voluntary. It's him giving up his life as a gentryman. I'd also rather have it be voluntary than for him to be dishonorably demoted which is how his usual self was going before I left (saw it in the page that was left for me a year ago from Az when I came back).\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Sure.\\"\\r\\nEsquire Mathias explains to you, \\"Aeryn's player came up with why he has been missing for a year and I agreed to it. Before I left they were engaged. It was arranged. His reputation slowly withered a bit however through IC actions and who he associated with. He was nearing demotion (which all happened). The reason he disappeared though was that Aeryn's father and brother had him kidnapped to keep him from marrying Aeryn. Her father did not want it to happen. Thought she could do better. They, of course, the Brooks would not have their hands dirtied so. They hired 'goons' (as Aer's player called them) to dispose of Mathias. They beat him near to death...Mat being well trained though as a soldier/squire....somehow got away. But it was brutal and he's been gone for the past year recovering. \<-- That on top of who/what his fiance is, the political frustrations and trying to maintain his public image to not shame the House - He's tired of it. He's never loved Aeryn. Especially since he was with Aedina for the better part of that and his time here. He doesn't believe he's meant to be a gentryman even though he was thrown into this path as a boy. He doesn't think he deserves it since he associates more with commoners than anything. And, he's tired. He doesn't think it's worth it. He wants to renounce his title (he'd give his land to Noe but I don't think that's how that would work or how staff would let it work(?) ). He wants to be a commoner and be able to associate with who he pleases, not play politics or worry about being dishonorably demoted because he talks to a slave who is trying to be a serf, etc. He'd rather leave honorably than dishonorably.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Balkaar/StoryPlotter Sirazad]: \\"How si the chat going?\\"\\r\\nEsquire Mathias wonders to you, \\"Does that make better sense than my just wanting a change from a player standpoint? IC, I think he has a good foundation for not wanting it.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou nod to Esquire Mathias, \\"Sure, but... given the lands are currently granted to him, but he's not a noble.. why not just have him be the typical slumming kid of nobility? Getting his allowance and living the life of a commoner?\\"\\r\\nEsquire Mathias tells you again, \\"He doesn't nor do I want him - dishonorably demoted for living such a life nor being the lazy gentryman of the House (like Brenner, who isn't Gentry yet). If he has a title and land...he has to work for it. Or so that's how I see it and so does he. And being demoted dishonorably is what will happen if I did that.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Balkaar/StoryPlotter Sirazad]: \\"Overall well actually\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"So how does he give up his land would you say?\\"\\r\\nEsquire Mathias says to you, \\"Well, he could speak to the current House Ambassador - But he didn't give him said lands so that would be improbable. So wouldn't he write to his Lord? Speak to him of renouncing his title and explaining his thanks and being honored to have had them while he did, etc, but expressing he does not deserve them/does not wish them? I don't know how common it was for someone to renounce their title back then just to be a common person with a common life. Also, since it never hurts to ask though I've been told by a couple players it's improbable that staff would say yes or that it could happen since they are granted lands...and he's not a noble - is it viable for them to be given to someone else who does deserve them? That is a Thane, one below Gentry - such as him telling his Lord how they've held the local embassy together and built it up from nothing and they should have it?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou shake your head, \\"You can't transfer lands.\\"\\r\\nEsquire Mathias nods to you, \\"Figured. No worries.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou say, \\"What I might suggest is.. if you really want this... RP it through as a bit of a discussion between his disfavor and inclinations both. So they are wanting to demote him and he's wanting gone, so they strip/he relinquishes some of his lands. Perhaps eeven more than it would have been (instead of 1 rank down, 2). That would make him a burgher. So halfway between gentry and freeborn. That way he's a commoner and can do what he wants, but obviously out there somewhere is his family still looking out for him.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"May be harder to rise back up again after, but at least he still has some lands to fall back on.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Balkaar/StoryPlotter Sirazad]: \\"And what has been her reasons? (Being curious only)\\"\\r\\nEsquire Mathias nods to you acceptingly, \\"Alright. Thank you for your time, hun.\\"\\r\\nYou ask, \\"Does that make sense to you though?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It wasn't an order, just my sense of what might work.\\"\\r\\nEsquire Mathias admits to you honestly, \\"It makes sense. It would get him demoted even. I've been told the same thing by the couple of players I spoke with. The thing is though....disfavor is disfavor no matter how you look at it. You aren't relinquishing anything even though it was something you don't want. It's still being taken from you because you're viewed as dishonorable, or what have you. It's not renouncing your title. It's getting where you want to be through having people not like you regardless.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Well as I said it could be both. His deeds catch up with him as you said, and at the same time he's \\"What should I do? I don't want this anyway, I'm not made for this.\\" And relinquishes more land trying to avoid insulting his liege or parents more.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou say, \\"So its a mutual sort of thing. Of course he'd still be avoirdupois having some of their lands, but wouldn't have the same expectations.\\"\\r\\nEsquire Mathias nods to you, \\"You're not seeing my point and that's fine, hun. What you're saying makes sense but it's not what I want. Thank you though for trying to help. I do appreciate it.\\"\\r\\nYou request again, \\"Why do you want all his lands gone specifically?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"OOC more than IC as IC he doesn't really need them all gone to go his own way.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nEsquire Mathias tells you, \\"I want a change. He's developed from how I had originally intended him and being a commoner suits him more. I don't want him to have any land, any benefits of what having land and title gives him. And ICly, it's not the point of him going his own way. It's him not wanting any part of it anymore. No land, no title, nothing. He's paid for his past deeds. So having him gain disfavor would be new actions that cause such and put him in a bad light. Which would be a big jump from what his personality is in order to get that disfavor.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Okay. I understand what you want now and that its definitely with a purpose. Let me discuss it with others and I can get back to you.\\"" \}) \}), ([  ]) \}) ]) ])

Maybe that is a part of the problem, as the natural inclination would be to step away or become antagonistic for a character, so it doesn't feel natural in the RP.

Aradhyl seems genuinely upset that Clover won't leave her alone.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl nods to you, \\"She is wondrous upset. She's been under a lot o' stress lately because o' things within her House and Clover's apparent pressure about letting things go is just adding to it all.\\"\\r\\nClover nods, \\"I think he was having fun flirting with her. He was upset with her once and had a scene by the tents... but otherwise he's just been trying to reassure her that he's not upset at her.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl sighs, \\"She and I both misunderstood his reassurances then.  It felt a bit like being stalked and threatened, especially after what she had been told about Clover.\\"\\r\\nClover says, \\"Sadly every scene seems to have been cross communications. Excited by the flute since they get along, and she thinks he's playing some game with her. Advises her to maybe keep things closer to the chest just now and she flees the room.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl nods to Clover, \\"She fled because o' the House things, Clover's remark was just the last straw.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl asks Clover, \\"What would you like to hast happen?\\"\\r\\nAradhyl rolls her almond heliotrope eyes.\\r\\nClover shrugs to Aradhyl easily, \\"I don't really mind conflict scenes. Clover was designed as a shit stirrer and has been pointed out many times he can be intimidating even when he isn't trying to be which seems to be the current case.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl nods, \\"He's wondrous persistent and if you add that to his reputation, it would make any young maid terrified.\\"\\r\\nYou hope, \\"If you feel OOC uncomfortable about something that happens, try to talk to each other OOC about it, so that it doesn't become confusion to the point of feeling like you're being stalked or harrassed? It doesn't seem like that was the intention at all.\\"\\r\\nClover grins bashfully, \\"I've actually been having him not react badly because you're a new player and he is a bit larger than life. Didn't want you to be in a situation where you weren't having fun, so I'll return the question to you. First, are you having fun, second, what are some of your thoughts?\\"\\r\\nAradhyl nods slowly, \\"I was having fun at first, aye, but then it indeed was a bit overwhelming because I honestly did not know how to hast her react anymore.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl smiles at Clover, \\"Clover indeed can be a lot o' fun to interact with so I do not want to lose that.\\"\\r\\nClover nods, \\"That's fair. I was going to say the simplest solution is for them both to be a bit fed up IC and just sort of ignore one another. But that does limit RP and interactions. Do you have any thoughts of other stories or paths things could follow?\\"\\r\\nAradhyl suggests, \\"A huge misunderstanding because o' language, perchance or is that too corny or hard to swallow?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAradhyl admits, \\"She still learning how to interact with most people because o' her background and the fact that I am a new player.\\"\\r\\nClover defers to Aradhyl, \\"My only real OOC concerns were 1. For myself that it was sounding like Clover was trying to really force himself on her, and that's no fun as a player to hear. 2. That you might be not having fun thus some of this developing due to you being stressed OOC. In terms of paths forward, I'm very cooperative and happy to go along with most anything :)\\"\\r\\nAradhyl turns to you, \\"Do you hast any story ideas?\\"\\r\\nAradhyl smiles warmly at Clover, \\"Thank you for being concerned about me oocly and I'm sorry that the whole thing hath caused you ooc stress too.\\"\\r\\nYou apologize, \\"Sorry, I was laying the baby down. Let me catch up.\\"\\r\\nYou admit to Aradhyl, \\"I don't know very much about your character or her pursuits. I also don't know where you feel you're struggling most in the game.\\"\\r\\nClover brainstorms still, \\"So, lets see... Clover is notoriously blunt and both quick to temper and cool off. Famous traits he's known for. Ara could be looking still to do him wrong but playing as his friend.. that would be sort of Rinaldi if she's really upset with him. She could see him as a power source as an ally and as someone who probably can give her good advice on how to behave on the Dockside of the gates. I don't...\\"\\r\\nAradhyl nods at Clover, \\"That would definitely work.\\"\\r\\nClover points to you, \\"What she said, a lot depends on your char which is why I left it to you. Clover is just being friendly both to Tork and Ara. Thus giving both advice here and there.  He's not really looking for benefit, but perhaps Ara is. I dunno.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl explains to you, \\"It's just that I'm still getting a feel for the culture o' the game, if that makes sense?  I've played so many and each hath a different set o' player and character expectations that aren't found in any help file.\\"\\r\\nYou think anyway, \\"If you mean in regards to storylines with Clover? You have the option of ignoring him. You have the option of trying to befriend him and clear the air, and both of them blow everything off as a misunderstanding. You have the option of making him your enemy entirely, but maybe not making that clearly known to him. It truly depends on the nature of your character and what you're after. Some are after information, some are after power, some after sexual intrigue, political intrigue, etc.\\"\\r\\nYou nod understandingly to Aradhyl, \\"Of course. It's going to take some time for you to get used to the atmosphere, the players, the language, and so forth. If you need more time to nestle in, you might avoid overly dramatic scenes for now.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl nods to Clover, \\"I like Clover's idea except for the doing him wrong part.  She might play him as a friend but it would be cause she's too cautious to actually accept him as one.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl nods to you, \\"Well.\\"\\r\\nClover says, \\"Well Clover fills an odd place. Part of the dynamic is the changing balance between the noble houses and the emerging merchant class. Clover is an example of that emerging merchant class as are some of the other guild leaders. But it isn't just you as a player being uncertain. The setting is uncertain because its a shifting one for everyone. :)\\"\\r\\nOOC -- Aradhyl says, \\"I typed okay\\"\\r\\nOOC -- You say, \\"Hehe\\"\\r\\nClover asks you curiously, \\"What sort of things do you enjoy for RP and stories?\\"\\r\\nClover means Aradhyl.\\r\\nAradhyl muses, \\"So it would be fitting for her to be cautious and use him for information, etc. while trying to decide if he's her friend.\\"\\r\\nYou smile reassuringly at Aradhyl, \\"You don't have to, it's just a suggestion until you're more sure how to handle what might come flying toward you. I'd encourage you to look to your fellow players OOC too if you aren't sure how to react to something or need advice. Usually they are willing to help to move the story along in a way that satisfies everyone.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl twinkles her almond heliotrope eyes at Clover, \\"I've been a builder and a coder. I indeed enjoy rping just about anything though.  I like hither because it's not combat based though.\\"\\r\\nClover nods, \\"She's in a House she has to weigh her allies and friends and even enemies as good enemies are hard to find :) Politics is the life blood of the Rinaldi in particular so its very suited.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl turns to you, \\"It's all right then to ask them oocly for advice then?\\"\\r\\nYou nod certainly to Aradhyl, \\"Most definitely.\\"\\r\\nClover so needs to get his bracelet on Aradhyl.\\r\\nClover chuckles, \\"Hither.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl nods, \\"Thank you.  I'm used to political plots that can take at least a year to come to fruition and fighting, lots and lots o' individually coded combat systems.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl grins at Clover.\\r\\nYou say, \\"And too, if you can't find the help you need from players, you can always assist and say you need help brainstorming.\\"\\r\\nClover nods, \\"@assist is a great tool. Staff here are very helpful and friendly about any topic to discuss.. well.. most.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl smiles at you, \\"Thanks! I've n'er had admin that would do that sort o' thing ere.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl wonders oddly about her mouth.\\r\\nAradhyl says, \\"People be going to think mine character hath gone daft or that I've switched her personalitly midstream.\\"\\r\\nYou titter endlessly, \\"I like it personally.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou say, \\"For a new character. I'd never use it on my regular ones.\\"\\r\\nClover requests of Aradhyl, \\"So, what I'll just ask is... if Ara wants to continue being stressed by Clover that's fine just focus on him pushing his advice and presence on her... lean  back from him pressuring her sexually as that is hard to contradict either IC or OOC.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl grins at you, \\"For a new one, aye.\\"\\r\\nYou nod agreeingly, \\"Or hug and make up and start trying to use him for information.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl nods to Clover, \\"That works and if she hath nay clue what he's talking about, she'll just smile and nod. We could ease into the hugging and making up part.\\"\\r\\nClover says, \\"And if she decides she's been misreading him that's fine too. He might give her a bit of attitude, but he's secretly a softy .. ironic for the mob boss.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl widens her almond heliotrope eyes at Clover, \\"Ha! The rumors were right then!\\"\\r\\nClover admits to Aradhyl apologetically, \\"And he was flirting and teasing because did read her as wanting him to flirt, and maybe give her an excuse to act just a bit outside of proper. Sorry if that was misread.\\"\\r\\nClover grins, \\"What? That he has attitude?\\"\\r\\nAradhyl shakes, \\"That he's a mob boss.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl actually shakes her head.\\r\\nClover whistles innocently, \\"I'm an upstandin member o' society... on th' guild council don't ye know. Course I do 'ave a few kneebreakers.. jes t' keep folk from walking way from a loan or causin trouble at a gamblin table an sech.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl apologizes to Clover, \\"I'm sorry too that you misread her.  She did enjoy the flirting, but she indeed doesn't want to act outside o' proper.\\"\\r\\nAradhyl peeks at her knees.\\r\\nClover encourages Aradhyl regardless, \\"Lots of ways things can go with them as friends.. or just cautious acquaintances. Feel free to approach him how it feels natural to you. I'll make sure he's responsive.\\"\\r\\nYou glance back-and-forth, \\"So we have a resolution then. Are you both okay to go back into the game world and carry on?\\"\\r\\nAradhyl nods, \\"I am.\\"\\r\\nYou thank Aradhyl, \\"Thanks for coming up and talking it out.\\"" \}), (\{ "arrianna", 1307674657, "Player was asked to file an assist or page staff about any issue she might have oocly or icly instead of @msging other players." \}), (\{ "arrianna", 1307674657, "arrianna has issued a warning to amishi for this behavior." \}) \}), ([ "warnings":1 ]) \}) ]), "warnings":1 ])

I do not mind her age, but I want no questions about her being a child or an adult. She is an adult. And there is no squirmiung in this field.

But I'd be fine with the 'cub' verb going.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie tells you, \\"In Alpha, Suzie was washed ashore from a far and distant land as a three year old koala cub.

She is an adult, and if you refer to her as a teenager, that would cause confusion.\\"\\r\\nYou listen interestedly.\\r\\nMiss Suzie tells you, \\"In the next release, she was a street urchin who had lived it tough ever since Lucius abandoned her.

She randomly chooses to like or dislike certain characters.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Thank you for helping me be in picture with this.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie admits to you, \\"She thinks of canines and felines as dirty, useless commoners that have no skill but breeding.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie tells you, \\"Because they are the most common animal type.\\"\\r\\nYou clap your helping hands smilingly, \\"All right, as you know in alpha staff was way freer about ranks, and that was understandable because not many nobles have been around.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"We do not mind any such dispreferences IG.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie nods to you, \\"I don't train anyway.

Because she basically is a teenager.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You can use adjectives in her appearance that hint her being youthful though.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I would much prefer to have it clear, that she is an adult.

And if they see a teenager, because of the modern time's influence, they will think -child-\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie whines at you, \\"I'd be fine losing the cub, but I'd rather have teenaged or at the very least young.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I am sorry, Suzie. It is the child status that is being lost and all that goes with it. Good and bad both.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie suggests to you, \\"Miss Suie is a miniature teenaged koala adult.\\"\\r\\nYou smile at Miss Suzie lopsidedly, \\"I understand what you say, but I also have to consider the general gameplay.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It is always hard to part from something you enjoyed and became a part of your playing experience.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I do not envy you for it. I understand your feelings.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie tells you, \\"That's a common bartering ground, having miniature teenaged koala adult would work.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"In a snow globe, since she is miniature.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"We can exchange it to .. uhm.. cherry blossom globe in the late spring for her.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie spent lots of Storypoints getting Suzie just perfect in a time when child characters didn't get things for free.\\r\\nYou say, \\"Well, you can then rejoice as you'll get some adjectives for free now.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie wonders.\\r\\nYou say, \\"And adjust her to the time passed to show all her education and personality in a different way.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie asks you, \\"Can I get an Australian flag as well?\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie shifts her sparkling violet eyes.\\r\\nYou say, \\"Right on the top of the vulcano in your cherry blossom globe.\\"\\r\\nYou nod permissively.\\r\\nMiss Suzie suggests, \\"Young koala adult. That's a good compromise.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Provided the builders agree. They are the ones that will confirm or refuse ideas, that are not related to childhood.

What's up?\\"\\r\\nYou chuckle, \\"Why, the players provide for the diversity that is the heartbeat of the game.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie nods to you, \\"But if diversity was what people wanted, English speakers wouldn't have concurred and annihilated countless civilizations.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie nods sagely.\\r\\nThe wind moans like a dying woman as it buffets against the tower.\\r\\nMiss Suzie asks you, \\"Am I able to play prior to having the appropriate adjustments?\\"\\r\\nXena has been informed of your page and must consent before she receives it.\\r\\n[OOC Page] accepted by Xena: \\"So Suzie will be made into an adult, no longer a kid. She pushes strongly for the teenage adjective to stay but I said a strong no to that. I told her it must be perfectly clear to anyone who sees her that she is no longer a child, but an adult. She then tried the adjective young coala, which I fear still falls into the first impression of a child and I am not exactly happy about it. She then suggested young coala adult, but that is already something I would leave to you. I do not know how you make people grown up, she said she paid a lot of stps for her kid char, which I have no clue about. If she did, she can I presume get a few free alterations? But it would be falling on your shoulders to do that. I just wanted to prepare you and warn you, she might try to squirm into remaining a child with adjectives. Do you know how generally making a cub into adult works?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"No, I would wish the changes to take place in order to avoid further troubles, but our builders are really very fast in handling situations.

I was worried that she would try to use it to get all the good from being a child without the limitations of being a char.\\"\\r\\nYou ask, \\"Also, do you recall the stps you have been paying for her? What was modified of stps?\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie considers.\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Slurpeeslurp/Xena]: \\"So, here's my verdict. She paid nothing except 50 stps for a title. She can keep the title and be called 'miss' since she isn't married. She is going to be an adult though, and no free alterations because she is the one who abused having the char, not us. I dont want to reward her for her neglect of the rules\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie admits to you, \\"I don't want a refund, if that's what you're offering.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"No, you just said you paid a lots of stps of her and I am curious of it. Could you recall them?\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie shakes her head at you, \\"I don't. And even if I did, that would be classified information.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie shifts her sparkling violet eyes.\\r\\nYou explain, \\"There is no sign in the system about anyone ever spending stps on child characters apart from the title.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Including Suzie or other chilredn.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie nods to you.\\r\\nMiss Suzie considers her thick black eyelashes, her sparkling violet eyes, her soft pink lips and her heart-shaped mouth.\\r\\nYou say, \\"The system records a 50 stp purchase of the title, which already is a discount as titles cost 100 stps, but not any other changes.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"So you keep the title and Nyx is the one who will contact you (or you can try to contact her, probably best in assist) about changing the body into adulthood.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie nods to you mopily, \\"But I can't play until then?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Best would likely be an assist saying you are waiting for her to help you with the changes. And as I said, no, you can not play until those changes take effect.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie asks you, \\"Can you remove teenaged and cub so that I can play?\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie wonders, \\"+setp suzie 'trait:species koala.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Let us return to the field of nobility first, there is still some changes in the system there you might not be aware of.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie nods to you.\\r\\nMiss Suzie asks you, \\"Does it adversely affect my gameplay?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Yes.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Or who knows.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It doesn't make you RP one way or another.

So I know that back in alpha it was in a way easier to become noble, due to lack of nobility. But with the increase of the player base that changed.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie nods to you.\\r\\nYou say, \\"We no longer needed to multiply the number of nobles and as such the rules applied a bit stricter. It is STP payed at the beggining of the character (before leaving the room) OR promotion tokens that makes someone noble. Or marriage.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"There is no other way. Adoption accordingly only constitutes nobility if it is escorted by promotion tokens.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Accordingly Suzie is but a commoner, who has nobles for wards. That still means she is powerful as she has high up supporters she can hide behind.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"but it also means, that factually she is a commoner.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie nods to you.\\r\\nMiss Suzie tells you, \\"She can still act like, play as, and think of herself as a noble though.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Yes, though saying you are a noble while you are not is a crime.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Of course if she has powerful supporters none will report her for it.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie nods to you, \\"That's kind of lame, considering she was always seen as a noble.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"That is already politics and how well she plays. She can CLAIM she is a noble, but I wanted you, the player know, she is not. So you aren't surprised if someone proves she is not and makes her face the consequences.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Well, she had powerful supporters. And she can convince those supporters to pay the promotion tokens for her.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"it is however not fair to give someone nobility just because someone adopted them.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"We didn't allow others, and the same rules apply to all.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"She can easily say: I am child of a noble.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie nods to you.\\r\\nYou say, \\"That is factually correct and what people believe from that... is up to them.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie says, \\"Or she can say...\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It doesn't mean she claims to be a noble.\\"\\r\\nYou encourage Miss Suzie.\\r\\nMiss Suzie narrows her sparkling violet eyes at you, \\"I am the child of Baroness Vanya di Rinaldi, you common turd. Begone from my presence.\\"\\r\\nViewing Woe object in popup window.\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Though in her absence they'll make a ward for her, but again that's IG already.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie nods to you, \\"And as for what can be called 'bad-language', I can use it so long as every word isn't a cuss word, right?\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie adds, \\"Or overly crude, like the C word.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie admits, \\"I don't use it often.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie says, \\"Cuss words, I mean.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Well we do allow cursing in the game, the game itself is not meant for children only of course. There are heavy cursers out there. Now your character is an adult. There is no limitation to career levels (apart from the cap) or being involved in sexual or murder scenes any more. However there is, as I mentioned, a need for ooc consideration for people.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"RP in a way that doesn't make people OOCly uncomfortable? Whenever possible that is.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"So if you see someone is getting OOC upset or they signal being upset, it might be best to check with them and try to find a way that is suitable for both of you.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie admits to you, \\"I try to never, ever make someone OOCly upset. Ever.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie actually adds, \\"Unless the player is a bully or a jerkoff.\\"\\r\\nMiss Suzie shifts her sparkling violet eyes.\\r\\nYou say, \\"So if someone is in a heavy curser environment, and curses, then they can not run to staff and say: I dislike cursing. With cursing themselves they give consent to being exposed to cursing. However if you play someone who never curses and avoids people and places that include cursing and you are still heavily cursed at without you ever giving a reason for it, then you might even count on staff to help the situation. Again depending on the situation, but that is a bit slippery field. There are no exact rules there.

There are some personal issues there as well, but we've barely played and rion's been playing for I think five months or so and i've only been able to rp with him like may be less than ten times and we conflict alot. I' tried to work things out but its gotten to the point. I can't play with him anymore. I don't need a mediator. I just prefer not to play with the player.I can easily get the paternity changed because I had suggested a plot involving that with the other person she was involved in. Yes. Understand that this is like alot of drama and all that stuff, but I'm human and I want to not play with this person that I'm connected to with a marriage certificate. Yes, they rushed in but she was pregnant. I thought this would help a storyline and stuff and I just can't do it anymore.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRion purrs, \\"I don't want to have someone rp me because they are forced to rp with me because I complain to them.

There are ooc personal reasons as well\\"He gave me permission to request you guys to help either annule it or do something so I can break this off.\\"I understand that. Basically personal issues, I need to avoid interacting with the player. Game wise- Rion has a backstory and I created her to rp with him. Yet, he barely gets on and as other characters I have messaged his alts to get him to play and he'll say later maybe. So I wait as long as I can and by the end when he does get on, I'm tired or don't feel like rping that much. Yes, Dieter is not his main, but if you are building a story with someone, especially one that involves marriage, a backstory like theirs and stuff, make efforts to rp with the person. We never really have had quality rp because of these feelings behind the being pushed into it. She's found interest in game in a complicated relationship and all. I joked around with the other player(not Dieter's player) about the pregnancy plot thing and them being the father. being she's having twins I suggested it again and we asked azrael and azrael told me to give an assist to you guys. I had not honestly told diet'er player because I don't have to really its my choice how I play my characters. Well, he got made with topsy saying she'd feel more comfortable for me to tell him and get him to assist with an okay. This led to other issues and stuff and I've come to the conclusion that I need to cut ties with him completely. I know that with the other player already okaying that one of the babies is his kid, he'd be fine with the other one being his kid too. I'll pay the props when it comes time. Dieter's player is fine with this me breakign ties with him and all.

I was having a bad day and trying to troubleshoot my laptop and trying to calm myself down on ICO at the same time.

I didn't think that this was benefitting my characters, because it would have been as if Anetta didn't spend any money and Sphinx did.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"But did you get in trouble? (I've got a lot of information tracked here, haven't read through it all) - typically what would happen is Cade should talk to you about it, how you should @assist to let staff know you were handed an item from your alt, and let us know so we can say if it's alright to keep the item.\\"\\r\\nNoire nods at you, \\"Yes I got in trouble both times though I can only recall being banned for the ribbon incident. I can't remember what happened with the first one.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Noire, \\"You got spoken to the first time - you didn't \\"get in trouble\\" in the sense that staff just want you to understand the rules. And want you to know what to do if a mistake like that does happen again. Since staff don't want to punish players, they just want to make sure that items aren't traded between alts.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"So the second time, the ribbon. Yeah, you bought a ribbon with one alt. But you didn't put it back on the trading table for the price you bought it for, you put it on the table for more than 6 times the price.\\"\\r\\nNoire blinks at you, \\"6 times?\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"But I'm not really worried about the money.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I'll believe that was a mistake, and it isn't a huge amount of money.\\"\\r\\nNoire frowns, \\"Now I'm curious as to the original price and what I set it for. I tried to make sure it was correct, though I did do a lot of refreshing from lag.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"The problem there is that you're already been talked to about giving items from one alt to another alt. Babur might be an accident. The trading table might be an accident. But we've now had two accidents within a week.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And more importantly, you were told that if it happens you should @assist. You didn't assist about trading the ribbon to your alt.\\"\\r\\nNoire admits to you, \\"I should have, but being frustrated with the.\\"\\r\\nNoire says, \\"Ugh, sorry. Cat stepped on the enter button.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"The original price was 3 denarii. You set it for 20. As I said, not a large amount of money.\\"\\r\\nNoire admits to you, \\"I should have, but being frustrated with the PC and the laptop and everything else I just didn't think of it.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"But the big concern is the not assisting about it. The assist probably should have come *before* you gave the item to your alt (and you should have had plenty of time, since you had to walk your alt to the tent to buy it)\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"OK. Forgetfulness I can understand. But you understand how it's really looking bad?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I believe there was talk about maybe a temporary alt ban. I'm not sure if that was put into place or not.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Yeah, that does look pretty bad, eh.. :(\\"\\r\\nNoire nods understandingly, \\"Yeah, it did look bad. And there was a temp alt ban of Anetta and Sphinx. Strangely enough I am slightly thankful for that, because it got me playing Noire more and made me realize how much I enjoyed playing her. \>.\>\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And staff aren't banning alts because they want to punish you - but two mistakes in a week - staff want to make sure there aren't any more mistakes that need to be watched for, whether they are intentional or accidental. There *are* players that constantly do alt trading accidentally just from not being careful to keep their characters apart, and they have to be limited to one alt too.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"But wasn't there already a punishment given and such for that?\\"\\r\\nYou grin, \\"Playing a new character can often be fun.\\"\\r\\nNoire nods at you, \\"Especially a one-armed tiger. :P.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Doctor Jahren, \\"Yeah, so there was a response to the ribbon with the temporary ban.\\"\\r\\nNoire tells Doctor Jahren, \\"It was for a week.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Alright, so we're here to discuss the month-long ban of Noire for transfering guild kitty money and items from a character that's now deleted. What about this case?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"So the third instance was when Sphinx sent a package with items to Khagra - that is totally fine. That package included some unique items, such as an eagles feather.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Which is fine - perhaps questionable as I'm not aware of any reason why Sphinx would be giving things to Khagra (But I trust you that there was an IC reason) - but something you need to watch out for. Since your alt is in Khagra's guild you have to make sure you're giving the items to *Khagra* and not to your alt.\\"\\r\\nOOC - Noire loses her connection.\\r\\n04:15:58 [INFO] Noire[catobelpas] loses her link.\\r\\n\> You ask Doctor Jahren, \\"I assume Khagra gave the armor and eagles feather to Noire at that point?\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Lets wait for Noire for a min.\\"\\r\\nNoire enters the world.\\r\\nYou say, \\"Oh, I didn't see that she left. I miss a lot.\\"\\r\\nNoire kicks Firefox.\\r\\nYou ask Noire, \\"What was the last thing you missed?\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Okay, repeat!\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Alright, so we're here to discuss the month-long ban of Noire for transfering guild kitty money and items from a character that's now deleted. What about this case?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Uh, the last thing you SAW. Obviously you don't know what you missed :)\\"\\r\\nNoire tells you, \\"Something about making sure I was sending the package to Khagra and not my alt.\\"\\r\\nYou ask Doctor Jahren, \\"I assume Khagra gave the armor and eagles feather to Noire at that point?\\"\\r\\nNoire nods to you, \\"I did sort of have an IC reason. When i was deleting Sphinx, i was in the commons clearing out my sacks, giving things to random people and saying I was \\"leaving town\\". Some people who can confirm this are Chesh, Matteo, Eldro (I think?), Meepers.. I think that's all.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Noire, \\"I believe you had an IC reason. I'm just pointing out it's a potential \\"trouble area\\" and you should know to be careful.\\"\\r\\nNoire tells you, \\"I also sent packages out to people containing things I thought they might enjoy. I sent packages to Brie, Lennox, and Khagra. Khagra sort of got the \\"misc\\" packages, things I couldn't really decide what to do with.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Noire, \\"All good, and fine with me.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Yah. And all of the armor sent is still in my char's room. I don't recall giving any of it out to anyone yet.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"and if you @assisted and told staff that you were sending a package to Khagra, who was your alt's guild leader, we would have told you that it's fine. (and it was fine to send it even without assisting. Although you'd twice been told to assist to make sure you don't get in trouble unnecessarily)\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Well my question is, since there's no actual rule-breaking here, how does Nyar have the authority to ban someone for a month completely?\\"\\r\\nNoire nods to you, \\"I really have no explanation of excuse for not assisting, this time.\\"\\r\\nNoire says, \\"or**\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"For sending the package to Khagra? He doesn't.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"But then Noire ended up with two of the pieces of armor that Sphinx owned. And the (unique) eagle feather.\\"\\r\\nNoire asks you, \\"Two? I thought there was only one?\\"\\r\\n\> You say, \\"I assume Khagra gave them to her. I'm not sure if Khagra knew they were alts or not, or if she got them in some other way.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Noire, \\"I've got a note in the tracker saying two.\\"\\r\\nYou shrug, \\"I wasn't there, just going by the notes left by staff.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"He got them from someone he knew, and offered them to his fiance.\\"\\r\\nNoire scratches her head, \\"I only recall the bronze greaves. Oh well, I guess.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Doctor Jahren, \\"OK. Makes IC sense. But... that's where Noire should have @assisted and let staff know that she was being given an item from her alt.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Noire, \\"Since we'd had pretty much the exact same situation with Babur already. And you were told the @assist so staff would know what's going on and not think you were cheating.\\"\\r\\nNew character: kaylen\\r\\nYou say, \\"and you knew the items had come from your alt.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"We were actually watching and waiting for the assist. For days.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Well Az, if it makes IC sense then... Why all this? And why your question just now?\\"\\r\\nYou tell Noire, \\"When you spoke to Nyar, you also told him that you didn't use any of the items that had come from Sphinx. Which wasn't true - you had already asked for the feather to be used in tailoring.\\"\\r\\nNoire nods to you, \\"I know, I should have. Again, I don't really have an explanation or excuse for not assisting. And as for the feather, I forgot about it like the third day after sending it off. Out of sight, out of mind, basically. I didn't recall it until Nyar said something about it.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"Because lots of things make IC sense, but that doesn't mean OOC they are alright. It IC makes sense for Jahren and Khagra to both attack Geradan, but it's OOC unfair for you to log them both in and have them both hunt him. Since that gives you two PCs doing the action. That's why we have rules about alt interactions.\\"\\r\\nNoire shifts her bright cerulean blue left eye and bright gold right eye, \\"One bad habit of mine is my godawful memory, hence my nickname \\"goldfish girl\\".\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Noire, \\"I have sympathy for that, I've got a terrible memory, and have to write everything down. But that's all the more reason to assist immediately, so your memory doesn't matter.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"The attempt to keep OOC/IC boundaries separate but bring them together all the same kind of confuses me right now.\\"\\r\\nNoire tells Doctor Jahren, \\"Careful, paradox talk like that can cause my head to explode.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"So you see the problem, though? Items have gone from one alt to your other alt at least three times over a short period of time. We tried to give you ways to avoid getting in trouble, we just asked that you assist and check that everything is alright - and said you wouldn't get in any trouble if you did that.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I believe that it was innocent - but innocent or not, the items had been sent from one alt to the other (through an intermediary. Babur, the table, and Khagra) - essentially the same situation three times. And no assists about any of them. I don't think there's much that Ny could do other than a suspension.\\"\\r\\nNoire sighs, \\"Yeah.. I'm just mildly retarded. Not that it's an excuse or anything, I'm just really not used to clearing things with staff. My previous game of 6 years is a little lacking in that area.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"We need to make the problems stop, whether you are intentionally causing them or not. We need to stop items going from your alts to each other without an assist being sent.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Ny could have went to you and to the other players involved for statements, that would help right?\\"\\r\\nYou nod understandingly, \\"Staff can seem distant, as well, which makes many players not want to let them know what's going on.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"You guys gave Abel's player an alt ban and let him only play one char. Can't that at least be the case here?\\"\\r\\nYou tell Noire, \\"If it's any consolation, there are players that regularly put in assists like \\"Hey, my alt Bob gave this gown as a gift to Mary, but Mary just gave it to me as a gift. Can I keep it?\\" or \\"My seamstress was asked to make a shirt for my alt. Can I do that, or should I send the job to another seamstress?\\" - and most of the time we go \\"Yeah, that's fine.\\" and let the player know, and get on with the game. And that way if another player is worried about alt interaction, we already know what's going on instead of spending time investigating.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"I'm not sure that more player statements would help. It's an objective fact that Sphinx's feather was given to Noire, and the fact that Noire accepted it (instead of saying \\"This comes from my alt, I'm not sure if I'm allowed to\\") - and didn't assist. If Noire had assisted, we wouldn't be having this discussion. That's really what got her in trouble.\\"\\r\\nNoire nods to you, \\"That does make me feel better. I'm going try to remember to @assist in the future, make a little notepad of it or prod Khagra to remind me if it ever comes up.\\"\\r\\nNoire approaches Doctor Jahren.\\r\\nNoire prods Doctor Jahren.\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Abel's player was given an alt ban. Potentially that could have happened here. I guess Ny probably didn't feel it would help, since an alt ban had already previously been given. Abel was also given an indefinite alt ban, while Noire was suspended for a limited time (what? One month? Two?)\\"\\r\\nNoire tells you, \\"One month.\\"\\r\\nYou shrug to Noire, \\"If you prefer I'll change the suspension to an indefinite alt ban.\\"\\r\\nYou explain to Noire, \\"The way the alt ban would work is that it would stay until staff believe that the problems won't happen again. Unfortunately, it's very hard to prove that there won't be alt problems while you only have one alt. Hard to do good behavior. But it's your choice.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Noire, \\"A note to yourself about @assisting is good. What I'd suggest is to assist early and quickly. It doesn't have to be detailed.\\"\\r\\nNoire slumps, \\"That's a difficult choice.. I like playing all three of my characters, but Jahren did a lot of work getting me an audience with you to try and get this straightened out.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"For example: \\"@assist 'Khagra just gave me some items from my alt. I'm not sure why, just letting you know.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"then a few minutes later '@assist 'Oh, Khagra was just giving them to me to hold, they've been given back now.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"or @assist 'I was just given an item from my alt, but it's just a pair of boots that any seamstress can make. Let me know if there's a problem with me keeping them.\\"\\r\\nYou admit to Noire, \\"It's your choice, don't feel like you have to change to the alt ban. Personally - I'd see the alt ban as a worse punishment (since it might last forever) and I'd stay with the suspension. But it depends on what you prefer, and how often you play alts.\\"\\r\\nYou shrug, \\"I'm perfectly happy with you playing one alt. That means we've got no potential problems at all, since it's impossible to make mistakes - assists or not - about trading items between alts if there are no alts.\\"\\r\\nNoire confirms with you, \\"How exactly would I be able to get the alt bans lifted, if that is what I choose? And who would be in charge of that?\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Can't really comment much considering the option was just now given, at this point. I just didn't want to see Noire completely removed from the game as she's a good player, she's fun and brings a lot of RP to the game.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Noire, \\"You'd have to prove to us that you wouldn't make any more mistakes or forget to assist when items move between your alts. I have no idea how you'd do that, though. And what we'd do is send your email (or log of discussion, or whatever) to the staff mailing list, and decide based on general staff input.\\"\\r\\nNoire asks you now, \\"My email of what? My requesting the alt ban lifted?\\"\\r\\n\> You tell Doctor Jahren, \\"I don't want to see her removed from the game, either. (and the suspension is for 1 month, so she's very welcome to keep playing after that time)\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Noire, \\"Yep, your email requesting the alt ban is lifted, and your reasons that would convince us there wouldn't be any future problems.\\"\\r\\nYou agree with Doctor Jahren, \\"She *is* a very good roleplayer, I've noticed that already.\\"\\r\\nNoire rocks on her heels modestly, \\"Aw shucks.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Well if she's a recurring subscriber, that's losing real money without any option until now. Which wouldn't have been given by the issuing staffer unless I'd brought it to your attention. Can you see the point I'm making here...?\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"She wasn't given an option by Nyar, no. But we typically don't give options. I (and probably Ny) see an indefinite alt ban as a worse punishment than a one month suspension - so probably didn't think to offer her a worse punishment than what she was given. I wouldn't have offered that if you hadn't suggested it (although I'm quite happy for her to change to it)\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Why would an alt ban be indefinite, exactly?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"As for loosing money - I'm going to sound mean, but I really don't care. None of the ironclaw staff are paid for their work - in fact, we all pay for our accounts just like every other player (and don't get to RP as much because staffing takes up a lot of time) - so if Skotos looses money or gains money, it makes very little difference to us.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"I just don't get that.\\"\\r\\nOOC -- Doctor Jahren privately messages you, \\"50 StP = premium account = about 26 something USD per month... Not a huge payment, but still rewarded for work\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"Because the ban wouldn't be lifted until we have a reason to think we won't have more problems. I'm not interested in my staff spending all their time watching players who have repeated the same problem three times already, in case they are going to make the mistake a fourth time. Or a fifth time. Or a sixth. So we want a solution that will stop the problem from happening again. Which means the ban would last until we are convinced the problem will not happen again.\\"\\r\\nNoire nods to you, \\"I think I am going to go with the alt ban.. Mainly because I really mostly play Noire with the other two on the side.. And I think I can prove that there won't be any future problems concerning alt exchanges, and the first way I can do it is go without my alts for however long it takes.\\"\\r\\n\> @msg jahren 'Trust me, the staff don't do it for the storypoints.

I already said I'm against porn-style language in general. But bear in mind this game is intended for an adult audience. We have issues that are roleplayed out, such as class system, slavery, racism, etc. I don't think any of those issues are particularly appropriate or targetted at the average minor. The game is intended for an adult audience. The minors are expected to be able to function in an adult social environment. That doesn't mean they should be exposed to explicit roleplay (in fact, we have rules specifically against that) - but it does mean they should be able to tell the other roleplayers that they are minors, and that they are not comfortable.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods, \\"Yup. As Tasha said, we do appreciate being told, and we are doing something about it. Additionally, you were uncomfortable in a scene - we'd like to do what we can to make sure that players have workable strategies to let their discomfort be known, so other players can avoid making them uncomfortable.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"It's not about laying any blame at your feet, or shifting responsibility. It's not about who is right or wrong. It's about making sure as many players as possible have the tools available to enjoy the game without being uncomfortable. One of those tools is to have ways to let other players know when they are making you uncomfortable.\\"\\r\\n\> @afk\\r\\nOOC -- You will be away from your keyboard.\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"for example, you found the mention of cum to be offensive. A European player might live in a country where that language is regularly on TV during prime time, and wouldn't necessarily be aware that you're offended if you don't say something. (And I'm not saying those particular players were unaware. I'm just giving an example of how part of keeping the game friendly is to tell players not to do offensive things, but the other half is to get players telling each other when they find something is offensive. Not all players have the same shared expectation.)\\"\\r\\nAkash admits to you and StoryHost Azrael, \\"I'm actually more frustrated now than I was prior to being brought up here, to be perfectly honest. I think I have made it pretty clear to anyone who read my post, and to those in the room at the time, and to you all, that I am uncomfortable with that style of RP. But, let me ask you this: When I get backlashed in public for having had issue with this style of RP, how does this keep me inclined to play with such players, or to continue scolding them and keeping them in line? I would think I had the -full- support of staff, and I'm not feeling it.

I'm not convinced that he has gotten over the personality issues he was suffering from when he was removed from CM, or that he possesses any ability to separate IC from OOC, and as eager as I am to boost our population with another sub, I feel that his presence would be problematic for our community and require him to be re-banned again in short time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you wish to allow him forum access that he might post in ICO, that's 100% your perogative and I wish him all the best, but I'm not interested in seeing him posting in our forums.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks and good luck!" \}), (\{ "jominey", 1537636510, "+opage jayland \\"Hey there.

I know you won't be on until much later tonight and I may not be, so figured I'd drop you an opage since you'll be vacationing this weekend. This is mostly a page for clarification on some rules that you may not have known since you're still relatively new to staffing or things that may have been communicated poorly by me or someone else. It's not a big thing, so I don't want you to get upset, just information that you may not have had and need to. 1) The !return command is only to be used on people idling in the commons or people stuck in a plot area. You cannot use it to send people back to their home who have logged out in your manor, your room, or anywhere else. Unless they're staff they will auto return to their room after a given amount of time anyway. 2) You can't spawn things on your pc bodies unless you have approval to do so from someone else first. Generally speaking when you are given permission to spawn something yourself you still have to spawn it on your staff body and then send it in to your pc. When possible you should use another staffer for your purchases and items to avoid anyone questioning what you did, how you did it, etc. 3) When requesting things for a specific event, they should only be used for that specific event because that's what the token cost is set for. You were charged 100 for your group of soldiers but then a player informed another staffer that you used them the night before the social for another small event when they were only designed for one time use. This may have been poor communication on my part, as since you referenced Sable's mourning boars which were a one-time use for the trial, I assumed you knew the horse soldiers were a one-time use for the Avo celebration. If you didn't, then I apologize as that was likely my fault for not being specific or clear. 4) Tokens: Tokens can't be swapped out easily. I know you're trying to often find ways to use something other than trade tokens, which is fine, but things like society tokens are more for props like your Avo soldiers or .. a group of musicians or some kind of special decorations for an event or a super high ranking Noble showing up one time to a party just for flavor. Trade tokens are what you need for the foods, drinks, and so on, and they aren't interchangeable. I'll try to post on the forums about what you can spend each different kind of token on soon since it seems to cause problems for many people. I try to let people be more flexible with tokens for things like plots because I know some tokens are harder to use up than others, but in regards to trading and imports only trade tokens will work or a token specifically related to the item you're bringing in. (Ie, if you're direct importing steel swords then weaponsmith tokens would work, but I think those are still technically trade). I hope this clarifies some potentially hazy areas, and if you have any questions or want to chat you're welcome to poke me here or on FB.\\"" \}) \}), ([  ]) \}) ]) ])

When alonzo and fred got attacked. alonzo was very protective as fred.. rightfully so.. they have some sort of mysterious close relationship. Thats fine by matteo sure. Alonzo nearly stabbed matteo just for trying to check on cornichon. So days later Orla tries to stupidly give Cornichon chocolate the first time alonzo/fred are in public. Alonzo looks angrily at orla and Matteo tries to intervene to spare everyone a scene. He asked her to back off and let them have some space. Of course orla being argumentative refuses. Matteo tries to impress on her that Fred chose Alonzo and that includes all of his quirks and over-protectiveness. He didn't say anything about their relationship, simply that Fred chose alonzo.. whether that was best friend or something more .. he left it up in the air. Of course Orla makes a huge deal about it and gets matteo in trouble with alonzo and fred who think he is suggesting their relationship all over the place, which he never did and he apologized and cleared it up with them. Then Tara is telling matteo he needs to stop causing rumors about alonzo/fred when he never did. That she wouldn't tell him who told her about it and he only had Orla to blame so they had their fight. Now emmaline is telling matteo that she saw him slander alonzo/fred which again never happened. So how is any of this fair? I got people attacking me from all angles, kicked out of the french consulate, belittled by alonzo/fred and called a protestant lover because he was just trying to do his job and keep the peace which Orla was trying to disrupt by insulting her betters.

I know it's frustrating to be caught in the middle but that's the game we play. You really need to figure out how to separate your personal feelings from your character because it will inevitably make everyone unhappy, including yourself. We have to learn how to have healthy OOC communication with each other without it turning toxic or volatile. Case in point, you have been hell bent on OOCly blaming Orla this whole time even though you yourself admit it could have been someone else's doing via lipread skill. We know who the source of the information is, and it is NOT Orla... so all the OOC hostility you are holding for her is unwarranted and only making things worse.

The terra cotta tile floor is broken into four distinct quadrants by a diamond shaped fountain with a simple, yet striking marble statue of a larger than life crane that appears to be frozen just moments before taking flight. The northwestern and southwestern corners each have small, intimate seating areas nestled under pale cream canvas awnings, while the corners opposite are home to garden beds with trellised vines reaching upward to spill over the limestone walls that tower nearly two stories high to provide protection to the establishment.

Overhead, an ornate candelabra hangs from a heavy swooping chain in elaborate whorls that hold flickering candles aloft.

Small candelabras sit on each available surface to fill the room with a warm, golden light. A narrow staircase leads up to the southwest, where a small seating area with chairs and a simple grey upholstered couch surrounding a low table is clustered. To the northeast is a large cook stove.

The walls are a pale cream color that accentuates the soft grey tones of the limestone floor, which has been covered with an olive green wool rug. Small candelabras sit on each available surface to fill the room with a warm, golden light. A narrow staircase leads up to the southwest, where a small seating area with chairs and a simple grey upholstered couch surrounding a low table is clustered. To the northeast is a large cook stove. Nearby a walnut table sits caddy corner to make room for a storage cabinet and matching work table. A large barrel is set near the cook stove to store water. To the north is a thick dark walnut door, and a hallway can be seen leading to the east.\\r\\nYou see a cold storage basement to the north; a hallway to the east; and a small butler's closet leading up.\\r\\nYou are standing near an open archway leading east.\\r\\n\> Roderick arrives through an open archway leading east.\\r\\n\> \> You move from an open archway leading east to a narrow staircase leading up.\\r\\nup\\r\\n\> You begin to enter a narrow staircase leading up.\\r\\n\> This small and utilitarian space acts as a pass through from the kitchen to the dining hall. A color palette of pale cream and dark stained walnut reflects the light from a simple bronze chandelier hung in the center of the ceiling. To the east is a small dark walnut door with a pointed arch that matches the door in the northern wall. Along the western wall is a narrow staircase leading down to the staff facilities. The only other remarkable feature of the room are the matching glass display cases that flank the door leading to the east, each stocked with the necessities for serving meals and entertaining guests.\\r\\nYou see a bright, spacious dining hall to the east; a modest kitchen to the north; and a warm gathering space leading down.\\r\\nYou are standing near a narrow staircase leading down.\\r\\n\> Roderick arrives through a narrow staircase leading down.\\r\\n\> \> You move from a narrow staircase leading down to a small dark walnut door leading east.\\r\\ne\\r\\n\> You begin to enter a small dark walnut door leading east.\\r\\n\> With glass pane double doors flanked by two large windows set in the northern wall, this dining hall is flooded with light by day and provides picturesque views of the inner courtyard of the estate. The impression of spaciousness is accentuated by the three large floor-to-ceiling mirrors set across from both the door and windows, which cast bright reflections from the doors and windows, and also the ornate whorled brass chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Lush olive green brocade draperies are draped effortlessly aside each window, door, and mirror. At the center of the space is a dark walnut table set with twelve matching chairs upholstered in forest green velvet. The terra cotta tiles of the floor are protected from the wear and tear of the chairs by an ornate green rug that is accentuated by the golden hue of the plastered walls. To the west is a small dark walnut door and the east wall is home to a larger version of the dark walnut door.\\r\\nYou see a small butler's closet to the west; a spacious entertaining hall to the east; and an enclosed central courtyard to the north.\\r\\nYou are standing near a small dark walnut door leading west.\\r\\n\> Roderick arrives through a small dark walnut door leading west.\\r\\n\> \> You move from a small dark walnut door leading west to a dark walnut door leading east.\\r\\ne\\r\\n\> You begin to enter a dark walnut door leading east.\\r\\n\> This spacious room is sparsely furnished, giving it an almost cavernous feeling that is softened by lush dark green velvet drapery that covers nearly every available wall. To the north, a set of glass pane double doors flanked by large windows provide views of the inner courtyard of the estate while adding illumination to the moody deep green color palette. Along the southern wall, small niches are furnished with padded cushions, with miniature chandeliers that match the larger versions hanging from the dark toned ceiling overhead. A small raised dais occupies the western wall, the dark walnut hues of the wood matching the rich tones of the walls as well as the smooth terra cotta tiles of the floor. To the east is a large dark walnut door.\\r\\nYou see a bright, spacious dining hall to the west; a rich, sumptuous foyer to the east; and an enclosed central courtyard to the north.\\r\\nYou are standing near a dark walnut door leading west.\\r\\n\> Roderick arrives through a dark walnut door leading west.\\r\\n\> \> You move from a dark walnut door leading west to a large dark walnut door leading east.\\r\\ne\\r\\n\> You begin to enter a large dark walnut door leading east.\\r\\n\> With a large door to the east and an arch to the west, the foyer of the estate is rich and sumptuous with earthy tones of terra cotta and a rich umber textured stucco on the walls. A dark walnut staircase, while modest in size, sweeps upward to curve along the southern wall. Opposite that is a smaller door with decorative niches on each side. Overhead, an ornate candelabra hangs from a heavy swooping chain in elaborate whorls that hold flickering candles aloft.

I haven't caught anyone else doing it. You've been caught which is why we're having the convo... no targeting intended.\\"\\r\\nNuit blinks at you, \\"...I don't really wish to name people, even if that's a thing that's being asked. ...Or maybe I'm misunderstand what we mean by \\"fondling and groping\\". Because scratches can be quite sexually-intended and delivered.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Uh... do you need specific examples? I'm not sure how more specific I can be.\\"\\r\\nNuit tells you, \\"It's ok, I will just keep her very neat and tidy in public. Probably more than you mean.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You know your own characters intentions. If the intentions are to incite sexual feelings or pleasure, you should probably move that RP elsewhere.\\"\\r\\nNuit agrees with you, \\"Certainly. I have one question.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Okay.\\"\\r\\nNuit asks you, \\"What of being approached by other characters for sexual RP? Nuit has been approached by two different ones that made me feel extremely uncomfortable - particularly because she explicitly told each that she was not interested - and that aggression / movement continued towards her.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It made you, the player, uncomfortable?\\"\\r\\nNuit replies to you, \\"Yes. Because it continued uninvited, and I had to suddenly figure out how to ICly deal with it so it stopped.\\"\\r\\nNuit explains to you, \\"I try to deal with my IC problems IC, and to keep my RL issues to myself, as much as possible. Not everyone plays that way, I understand, but... it's my preference. And I avoid the character IC for the most part, after that.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You should tell that player that his/her RP is making you uneasy. Log the convo too. If it still persists, get us involved.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Can I ask who the characters are?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"if it's happening to you, it might be happening to others and that's not cool.\\"\\r\\nNuit replies to you, \\"Ruggero, and Druss. Ruggero's player knew of Nuit from when I originally played her, and Ruggero immediately came onto Nuit as soon as she came back, asking for an IC love-affair of her. She declined several times to the point where I hate playing with him now.\\"\\r\\nNuit continues to you, \\"And Druss was courting Nuit, wanted something intimate, and Nuit ICly told him she wanted to slow things, be courted properly, and he grabbed her ass and fondled her in public places (though privately) more than once. I nearly quit the game over that one.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I'll make a note of that. Definitely don't be afraid to tell people they are making you uncomfortable oocly.\\"\\r\\nNuit explains to you, \\"I've been seriously toying with the idea of having Nuit simply swear off sex altogether, because the sexual aggression was getting SO intense from every male player advancing their intentions towards her.\\"\\r\\nNuit shrugs to you honestly, \\"I broke. Got tired of it, found someone with whom I could deal with it and who will ICly protect Nuit.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Just please say something if it persists and keep a log of those convos. Get us involved if it doesn't stop.\\"\\r\\nNuit shakes her head, \\"No, not -every- male player. There are a few really good ones who don't do anything like that.\\"\\r\\nNuit agrees with you, \\"Ok, I will. It was seriously getting too much for me, and I'm sorry for my part in what's happened since.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Sometimes it's just people not understanding the rules (like in your case)\\"\\r\\nNuit nods to you, \\"Ok. I do genuinely appreciate this conversation. I think I didn't even realize how intensely it bothered me until I told you.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Other times it's people getting a thrill out of knowingly breaking the rules because of ooc perverse reasons. The latter we don't need polluting the game but we need people to speak up and provide logs of the bad behavior before we can do something about it.\\"\\r\\n23:16:57 [INFO] Baronetess Kilana[skiwaymtn] loses her link.\\r\\nNuit agrees with you, \\"Yes, I agree. I truly enjoy the nuances of the game that are NOT sex-based; they're my favorite parts.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I appreciate the honesty.\\"\\r\\nNuit admits to you, \\"I appreciate you stepping up and scolding me, so I don't find other ways to deal with it.\\"\\r\\n23:18:07 [INFO] Carlon[haystack] loses his link.\\r\\nNuit shakes her head, \\"I hate it, sometimes. It's incredibly frustrating.\\"\\r\\nYou nod.\\r\\nNuit tells you, \\"And I -love- this game.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"My lady just got off work so I have to log.

And that, why the fuck are you emitting in an OOC scene?  Quit metagaming and trying to control every scene you are in.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nValdus just raises his light right eyebrow.\\r\\n\> You say, \\"At this point, I'm just ready to quit the fucking game.

Hanneman's characters picking on valdus is a ligitimate reaction IC to this sort of behavior.  This has been missconstrude as OOC aggression to the point where it escalated to make that a fact. It however did not start that way.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nStoryPlotter Viper says, \\"Can we agree on this?\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nValdus chuckles, \\"Yes I am not aggressive ooc towards him in the slightest, this is bullshit sometimes.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nStoryPlotter Viper says, \\"That attitude is not helping.  This is an issue and it needs to be resolved, take it seriously.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nValdus informs StoryPlotter Viper, \\"I haven't quit have i?

Oh my bad guess I get slaps on the wrist and he doesnt.\\"\\r\\n\> You say, \\"All of my characters are acting IC.  The fact that ALL of my characters HAVE to act IC, involving this one character, I am angry about OOC.  I feel like I am being manipulated into a position where I can be accused of alt abuse, and that pisses me off OOC, too.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nStoryPlotter Viper says, \\"Don't pull the sarcastic snide remarks with me please.

I play Valdus how Valdus is, I don't see how I'm at fault here.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nStoryPlotter Viper says to Valdus, \\"Talk to me not him.\\"\\r\\n\> You tell Valdus, \\"It is not that Valdus is an antagonistic criminal, that's fine.  It is that you metagame, you find loopholes, you do not RP cooperatively.  You abuse and harass people both IC and OOC as this character, and THAT has to stop.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nValdus peeks at you now, \\"How do I not rp cooperatively ? You came into the commons the other day and told Val he's under arrest he simply told you no, you're the one who ran away.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nStoryPlotter Viper says to you, \\"It is Valdus' turn to speak please wait.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nStoryPlotter Viper says to Valdus, \\"What did I just say? Speak to me and tell me what you think can fix this, i will not give you another warning.\\"\\r\\n\> You remain silent.\\r\\n\> \\r\\nValdus tells StoryPlotter Viper softly, \\"And I don't metagame, I make multiple hand gestures and expressions to help make my point in a fast way, I'd say if I was doing an action to someone before they could even react and I did it to them like 4 times that'd be metagaming.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nStoryPlotter Viper says to Valdus, \\"The metagaming isn't emitting it is leaving a room with no RP to avoid confrontation, I've SEEN you do it before. You aren't innocent in all this.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nYou hear a terrified shriek.\\r\\n\> \\r\\nValdus asks StoryPlotter Viper, \\"Did I say I was innocent?  I've done that before, -before- Then Iw as warned so I stopped, the other day It seemed like I did it because he said something -literally- right when I pressed enter to enter the other room.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nValdus tells StoryPlotter Viper, \\"The only other time I can think of me leaving confrontation is when Carrot arrived and I had told people I was leaving for rl reasons before hand and then Carrot walked in and it looked like I was evading the law. It pissed me off but I had to go.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nValdus grunts somewhat, \\"And how many times has Hanneamn -run- away from a scene literally just run away when it doesn't go his way out of anger, that's Metagaming isn't it?\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nStoryPlotter Viper says, \\"I'm not saying something like that can't happen. I know it does. Hell I've done it before. RL does come before game and that is something we all know. But taking a moment to @oocly explain to the person who might misunderstand the action due to lack of contact can go a long way into avoiding these sorts of misunderstandings.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nValdus nods to StoryPlotter Viper, \\"Exactly I told Carrot that I even told my friends to tell him why I had to leave.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nStoryPlotter Viper says, \\"I think in a lot of Hanneman's instances of leaving a scene it was to avoid losing his temper ingame.  He likely stepped away from the computer to cool off.  I've done this myself as well.\\"\\r\\n\> You say, \\"From Wikipedia:  \\"Metagaming is a broad term usually used to define any strategy, action or method used in a game which transcends a prescribed ruleset, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game. Another definition refers to the game universe outside of the game itself.  In simple terms, using out-of-game information, or resources, to affect one's in-game decisions.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nSomewhere beyond the iron barred door, chains rattle.\\r\\n\> You nod to StoryPlotter Viper, \\"True.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nValdus shrugs his shoulders at StoryPlotter Viper, \\"I don't see how that's still not metagaming and I'm getting scolded for it when maybe -i- needed to cool off.\\"\\r\\n\> You say, \\"Also, focusing on specific instances in which you are innocent of what you are accused of in a general manner while shifting the blame to the accuser is a classic manipulation tactic.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nValdus shifts his ardent, starless black eyes, \\"It's how I play Valdus, he's a manipulator I still dont' see how that's ooc?\\"\\r\\n\> You say, \\"Because you use the limitations of the gam'es systems to do it.  That IS ooc, and it is at the very least certainly not RPing cooperatively.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nValdus straightforwardly tells StoryPlotter Viper, \\"Look I'm sorry that he gets ooc offended each time he cross paths with Valdus but I'm not going to change the way I play someone because -one- person doesn't like it.\\"\\r\\n\> You wait for StoryPlotter Viper.\\r\\n\> \\r\\nThe torches which line the room crackle softly.\\r\\n\> \\r\\nStoryPlotter Viper says, \\"Okay, clearly this isn't going to resolved in the way I had hoped.

That means you cannot speak to each other IC you are not to involve each other vicariously through other people.  The person who is in a room first gets to stay BUT they cannot simply stay in one place to stop the other from being able to go there.  I will be watching the situation closely as will the other staff.  This should stop any further arguments disagreements etc.  In instances of plots, it is first come first serve and the first to arrive is the one that gets to go.\\"\\r\\n\> \\r\\nValdus pulls his drooping, exaggeratedly oversized left ear and an exaggeratedly oversized right ear, \\"Are you serious?

Did you feel there was anything in particular that Ny handled badly?\\"\\r\\nNix shrugs to you, \\"Well we're both just generally confused about the rules I think. I'm -still- unsure whether or not Rape plots are allowed but meh I'm just honestly not even paying attention to it anymore.\\"\\r\\nYou roll your bright black eyes, \\"We've been through this already. Ny has been through this with you. I think he's very clear on whether or not Rape plots are allowed. Let me check your earlier conversation...\\"\\r\\nNix shrugs to you, \\"You say that but then when a rape plot happens ICly I've been told that if the players OOCly are ok with it then its totally ok.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"To quote Ny: If you are referring to Crina's player re: rape plots. She was very forceful that there was no rape plot, no coercion, she felt no OOC pressures, and IC she always felt like her character had a choice. So as the principal involved, she denies any such thing exists.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Earlier we spoke, and I told you the same thing. I also told you that we do not allow rape plots, and if you have any evidence that a rape plot happened, you should tell me. Send me the log, have the people involved talk to me, etc. - you said Tsubasa might have a lot, but he never sent one in. From where I'm standing, the only person saying there was a rape plot is you.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Also, as I said in our earlier conversation - even if there was a rape plot, it's not up to you to enforce any punishments on the other player. Your role is to report it to staff, and they can deal with it as they feel is appropriate. Even if you don't agree with how they deal with it.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"On that topic, you *didn't* assist about there being a rape plot, and instead IC told people about it (despite there being rules against it) and only assisted claiming there was a rape plot after you were told to stop spreading those rumors IC.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"... which means, unless you can present some sort of evidence that there was a rape plot... we're going to put that aside. Treat the situation as if there was no rape plot until further evidence appears, and continue.\\"\\r\\nYou ask, \\"OK?\\"\\r\\nNix nods to you understandingly, \\"Got it. Not that I'll even bother anymore but alright.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Cool.\\"\\r\\nYou ask, \\"Was there anything else about the way Ny handled things that you were concerned about?\\"\\r\\nNix scratches his neck, \\"Not that I can recall. But ofcourse theres this issue with me and my alts and I just thought I'd get that settled by going through you.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Sure.\\"\\r\\nYou ask, \\"The issue being that he limited you to one alt?\\"\\r\\nNix nods to you, \\"Something like that. I've still got my alts because I asked if I could speak with you and make sure things were final as I had a few words to say before my alts got taken away.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Sure.\\"\\r\\nNix explains to you, \\"By my standards, ofcourse biased probably, I don't think I should have my alts taken away. After all the reason to do so is to discourage alt abuse. I've already done that myself. Both characters, Alister and Gerald, that were involved with Clover in any way I have deleted and begun anew with fresh characters. Seems to be working out too.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"That's a significant consideration. We do have these rules to reduce alt abuse. But not only to reduce alt abuse for you - so other people feel that we're enforcing the rules too. We'll always try to enforce them fairly - and we are most concerned with stopping the problems rather than punishing the players.\\"\\r\\nNix shrugs to you, \\"I've even made it a point to just avoid him entirely unless I couldn't prevent it.\\"\\r\\nYou explain, \\"The usual process is to remove alts, and leave that indefinately until we have a reason to think that the player won't abuse alts again. Which, of course, is very hard to do if you don't have alts.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"So you showing good will helps the case, and probably would help you get the alts back sooner.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Avoiding players you have an OOC problem with is a wise idea. IC conflicts and arguments are fun, but if it's an OOC problem, then avoiding them, or talking about the problem OOC is probably wise. It's a good move on your part.\\"\\r\\nNix approaches the green grass.\\r\\nNix sits down on the green grass heavily, \\"So yeah. I've just about done everything I could to get away from that mess.\\"\\r\\nYou agree, \\"That's a good thing.\\"\\r\\nNix shifts his sharp, mysterious cerulean blue eyes, \\"And technically I only have 2 alts because I don't even use Saren that much. Bring him on every now and then but I haven't found the time where he 'clicks' into the gameworld ya know?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"But... there was a fair amount of alt interaction, and targetting of another player before you distanced yourself. Too much for us to just brush aside. You'd been spoken to about this earlier, and it didn't stop - so now we need to do something. We want to restrict you to one alt so you can keep playing the game, instead of suspending you (as we have done for other players who did this sort of thing in the past) - and since you're showing improvement, hopefully when you get alts again it won't be a problem, as you now know better ways to deal with the situation.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"I know what you mean. I have alts that I never log on either ;)\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"When I log them on I just don't know what to do with them.\\"\\r\\nNix snickers at you.\\r\\nNix hrms to your words, \\"That actually not be bad. If it was two weeks in the future or so. Nix has a trip planned to aid the blockade and I wouldn't be able to log him on. Well I -would- but not be able to do anything with him.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I couldn't say how long it'll be for. It'll be as long as it takes the guides to feel that the problem won't happen again. More likely a few months minimum, and potentially much more.\\"\\r\\nNix tilts his head, \\"And the tourny tomorrow at noon.\\"\\r\\n\> You say, \\"Indefinate.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I'm happy for you to keep your alts for the tourney tomorrow. Then you can say any goodbyes, explain about going on a trip, etc.\\"\\r\\nNix boggles at you, \\"A few -months-?\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Nix, \\"Sure. At minimum.\\"\\r\\nNix frowns at you.\\r\\nYou equally frown at Nix, \\"You know you did the wrong thing. You know we tried to sort things out before this was necessary. You know that problems like this make the game less fun for the other players, too - and that encouraging players is a large part of making the game work. I don't think it's unreasonable - although I understand that you don't want to loose your alts.\\"\\r\\nNix smirks at you, \\"I'm just amused that this all started with Clover and a simple request and distrust.

I assumed you had logged off.\\"\\r\\nNix shifts his sharp, mysterious cerulean blue eyes, \\"Just typed who and pop!\\"\\r\\nNix mentions idly to you, \\"And I did stop spreading those rumors. Needless to mention it was Clover who randomly showed up in the commons halberd drawn and already trying to kill Gerald.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"You did stop with the rumors, that was good.\\"\\r\\nYou ask, \\"Anyway, shall I send you back into the gameworld, so you can continue RP and/or make any arrangements for your alts.\\"\\r\\nNix shifts his sharp, mysterious cerulean blue eyes, \\"Thats when I decided things were out of hand and rediculous.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You'll need to pick which PC you want to keep playing. I assume it'll be Nix?\\"\\r\\nNix shakes his head to you, \\"I would assume too but I guess I'll have to choose Kino. Its in my best interest to take a break from anyone involved with Clover.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"That's imminently sensible.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And if you do have any problems with clover OOC - please PLEASE do assist. None of this happened because you assisted, it was because *other* people assisted about things you were doing, not because you assisted about things Clover was doing.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Get your side of the story in. He's doing a rape plot? That's against the rules. @assist about it, rather than jumping in IC, etc. - then we know what's going on, and can help sort things out before they go this far.\\"\\r\\nNix hrms to you, \\"I have tons of problems with him OOC. Only problem is that I can't get ahold of those things from him himself. I get ooc info about him involved with more technical rape plots but hey...I'm just confused.\\"\\r\\nYou shrug, \\"Any info you get about him doing that, encourage those people to email their logs to me - it can go directly to azrael@ironclaw.skotos.net if you are worried about other staff not handling it properly.\\"\\r\\nNix explains to you, \\"Tsu' player informed me that he found out with his char Liala that Clover ordered Marea, anna and Hush to all..play..with eachother in front of him or Anna and Marea would lose their jobs. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if this is true as my experience from Clover's plots he likes to pull that kinda thing. The pressure.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Ok. I'll look into that. RP like that isn't banned as long as the players are all comfortable and don't feel pressured. But if they do feel pressured, then we need to deal with it. Thanks for reporting that. Could you please get Liala to put in an @assist - that way it's officially tracked and recorded in case of future incidents.\\"\\r\\nNix notes your words, \\"That exactly the point I'm making. Its ok Icly if the OOC players are alright with it. I just can't help but disagree with that.\\"\\r\\nNix shakes his head, \\"If that information gets to the public player base its no doubt people are going to think 'rape'. You see?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Assuming the information that *did* get to the public playerbase is correct. How do you know OOC that clover threatened their jobs? They might have just IC *felt* like he did. Or maybe he did threaten the jobs, but that's what they were hired for. Or maybe he did threaten their jobs and it was inappropriate. At any rate, that's something the guides would look into and make a decision about.\\"\\r\\nNix peers at you, \\"Its just simply easier to not allow it isn't it?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"IC pressure on other characters is perfectly valid in most situations - that is largely what politics is about - so we need to be careful not to force every PC to be nice to everyone else, and never to threaten or push. But we do need to make sure that no players are pushed into a situation they don't want (including witnesses, etc.)\\"\\r\\nNix shrugs, \\"Just from my perspective it would simply cause problems. Yes pressures are fine. They're in everyday life but -sexual- pressures thats where things get iffy.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It's not so easy to draw a line. Wherever we draw the line it will be fuzzy and require judgment. And the stricter we make the line the *less* clear it is.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"for example, what if Clover never threatened their job, but they heard from another character that he would fire them if they didn't do it. That could mean Clover's player did nothing at all - or it could mean that Clover's player talked about how he wants girls that do that. Either way, would that be counted as pressure?\\"\\r\\nNix grins at you, \\"Liala found out from Marea. A witness and 'victim'.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"What if they didn't hear anything, but just assumed? Or what if that's the RP they're after - unfortunately, as much as I want to focus the game on politics, most players prefer to focus on sex. Not just clover.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"The rule of thumb is that the 'victims' should assist if they feel that they are pressured. And their friends should support them in that.\\"\\r\\nNix nods to you, \\"Well I'll see about getting them to talk. In all honesty this whole business with clover is just tiring. I mean purpose of this game is to promote -good- RP. all he likes to do is promote good RP for himself.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Nix, \\"There are many other players that enjoy RP with Clover. It might not be the style of RP you enjoy - which is fine, you can avoid him.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And even if he didn't ever involve other PCs (which he regularly does) - there's still no rule against bad RP, as long as it's not unfair. We have PCs that never do anything other than fish, for example.

Ok so this is what happened: The player Rhea and myself were discussing about asking the you all to remove @hot because people abuse it -so- much. Ironically as we're talking about it someone does just that. Abuses it. I watch the 'who' list constant and this is what happened. Toby logged on, checked the room i was in (which is totally out of the way and was on @hot at the time) and without RP just walked out and logged out.\\"\\r\\n\> [OOC Page] from [Ironclawz3/Alister]: \\"And for Rhea's player this isn't the first time its happened. You can ask her for more information on those other events\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Ironclawz3/Alister]: \\"So... Toby turned up (presumably because of hotspots) then left without saying anything? And didn't log an alt in to go to the location or something?\\"\\r\\n\> [OOC Page] from [Ironclawz3/Alister]: \\"Toby -was- the alt. a minute or two before he walked in he was offline and hadn't been online at all. Then randomly he logs on, walks in and checks whos in the room and leave and logs out\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Ironclawz3/Alister]: \\"*nods* ok. I'm putting this in the tracker, so the guides can have a look at it. In general, though, @hotspots is there precisely so players can see where the RP might be happening, and drop past to see if they can get involved. So there's not anything \\"bad\\" about using it. A good roleplayer will come up with an IC reason for why their character is going there, or not go to inappropriate places, but it's not really \\"unfair\\" for them to use @hotspots to find other PCs to RP with. Otherwise we wouldn't have @hotspots.\\"\\r\\n\> [OOC Page] from [Ironclawz3/Alister]: \\"Could you atleast make a way to where you can make yourself invisible to @hot? That way if you want alot of people in a hidden location for some sort of meeting or whatever no one comes to just see whats up?\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Ironclawz3/Alister]: \\"Currently, no. Although it's been requested by a few people. More likely what we'll do is make certain locations that don't show up, so having meetings at the Turret Tavern, in the sewers etc. might not show in hotspots. So there would be \\"secret meeting\\" locations, but PCs who get to know those locations might still know where to visit to check for activity\\"\\r\\n\> [OOC Page] from [Ironclawz3/Alister]: \\"I can totally understand people actually -randomly- checking in but..not so much randomly walking in with an alt and leaving without a word. I mean he didn't even stay for 4 seconds! He was, and out just like that.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Ironclawz3/Alister]: \\"That might just be bad RP on his part. Unfortunately, we can't police that :( - but yeah, seeing something on @hotspots and deciding \\"My char might visit there, and see if there's any fun RP\\" is perfectly fine and allowed (even encouraged. Better to have the PCs together RPing than standing around not doing anything)\\"\\r\\n\> [OOC Page] from [Ironclawz3/Alister]: \\"So its not alt abuse to log in an alt just to check out a room?\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Ironclawz3/Alister]: \\"Not as long as doing that doesn't unfairly help their other alt. It'd be abuse to log in an alt to check a room before deciding if the other alt attacks, or something. But just checking a room, when there's no reason to think that it benefits their other alt? Nope, that's not alt abuse.\\"\\r\\n\> [OOC Page] from [Ironclawz3/Alister]: \\"K..I'll just put up a post tomorrow mention about Courtesy of Gaming \>.\>\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Ironclawz3/Alister]: \\"*nods* and yeah. That's probably the best thing to do. Make a post. Point out it's rude to walk in and out without even stopping to RP. Heck, you both might have been willing to have a really fun scene with Toby, and everyone missed out.

Is that possible?\\"\\r\\nYou recap, \\"The issue was engaging in public TS, specifically in the bath house. The issue is that the player was aware that this isn't allowed. In past infraction had written up guidelines that specifically noting that baths weren't appropriate for TS. On the other hand, he was upset that other people also engaged in TS inappropriately and felt he was being unfairly targeted.\\"\\r\\nYou query Vasilis, \\"Is that a reasonable summary for Tasha?\\"\\r\\n21:56 [LocalGame\|Spot] \\"Why would we have another player up? Did he have anything to do with it?\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha nods, \\"I remember the guidelines you wrote, they were good. They actually mentioned the bathhouse specifically as a place you shouldn't TS.\\"\\r\\nYou query StoryGuide Tasha, \\"Were those ever posted? Meerclar mentioned them, thus I listed them in the recap, but I haven't read those guidelines myself.\\"\\r\\n21:57 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"I am not saying we should, just letting people know that he was asking if it were possible. I shall page him saying sorry no\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha shakes her head, \\"I don't think they were poster, Meerclar has them in her email.\\"\\r\\n21:58 [LocalGame\|Spot] \\"Ask him if he was involved, and in what context he would be present?\\"\\r\\nYou nod to StoryGuide Tasha, \\"I'll ask her for a copy.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha smiles at Vasilis, \\"Has Meerclar actually spoken to you about this latest issue yet? Last I heard she tried to talk to you and you logged out saying you didn't want to talk about it.\\"\\r\\nVasilis says, \\"Pretty much...I know what I did was wrong. Yeah, i'm not perfect, and I make mistakes sometimes...some more than others. Yes I wrote up those guideling a good while back as well...and no, they were never posted...don't think anything I wrote was posted on the forums, honestly...which was somewhat of a disappointment. And Meerclar hasn't spoken to me...the RL relationship is, eh...-strained- between us, and despite us having eachothers MSN...I have little feeling that she wants to talk to me...and I honestly don't feel like talking to her, if I can help it.\\"\\r\\nYou tell StoryGuide Tasha, \\"I can copy from the log of it, but I'm not sure it would be productive. It was rather hostile.\\"\\r\\nYou ponder, \\"Actually it might be helpful in context just to get back to the primary topic.\\"\\r\\n22:01 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"Meer told me she tried to talk to him about it, as she and I felt a 3 month suspension was in order, but he refused to speak to her and logged out. Az and I spoke about that, and we felt refusing to speak to staff was a pretty blatant reason to say we can't sort it out\\"\\r\\n22:02 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"Asked as spot suggested, now Jahren says I'm not directly involved, I'm just being asked by a friend to be present for whatever reason. If it's not possible, that's cool\\"\\r\\nOOC -- StoryGuide Tasha privately messages you, \\"Who was hostile, Meer or Adonis or both?\\"\\r\\nYou quote, \\"StoryGuide Meerclar supposes to Adonis, \\"You know what we want to talk about, right?\\"\\r\\nYou quote, \\"Adonis says, \\"yeah.\\"\\r\\nYou quote, \\"StoryGuide Meerclar asks, \\"What do you think it is?\\"\\r\\nYou quote, \\"Adonis says, \\"As much as i'd love to play a subtle little mind game, i'm pretty sure the staff has already come to a final verdict well before this conversation is taking place. The verbal charade's fun and all...really...but for once i'd like to just skip all that and just get straight to the nitty gritty...\\"\\r\\nYou quote, \\"You agree with Adonis, \\"Staff has a predisposition. That can be influenced by the player. Rather than asking what you think the topic is, let me spell it out. TS in public places, when you yourself wrote up guidelines for TS that specifically prohibited the baths. The question is, why you did it anyway, and what's a reasonable response given an existing suspension. Your input is valuable in determining the latter. That a more upfront approach?\\"\\r\\nYou quote, \\"Adonis says, \\"Y'know what...i'm done debating, and all that wonderful crap that goes a long with it. I'm not in the bloody mood to put up with this shit. Do whatever the hell you want, because they outcome's always going the same, and i'm done with giving any sort of excuse to my damn actions when other people have pulled the same shit even to this day. Suspend me, ban me, or whatever the hell it is you guys do, because I can say whatever I want and it's not going to change shit. I'm done. Goodbye.\\"\\r\\nYou admit to Vasilis, \\"As I said, there was a predisposition towards a judgement, but your input and response would have an impact. As you likely guessed, your response didn't end up helping. So, instead lets perhaps take it from where we left off without Meerclar here, since you seem to have some animosity there?\\"\\r\\nVasilis says, \\"As i've said before...it does feel like i've been unfairly targeted. I admit...i've had some love scenes in public rarely since the essay, but i've tried to make sure to move them off to private locations before they became something past -PG13-, and yet the time I really mess up out of all those months, I get grilled into...rather severely. As i've said before...other people on the playerbase TS in public...and on a regular basis at that...so why dosen't anything happen to them? And this isn't meant as a personal attack...but I know Meerclar plays Ryan for a fact...and i've seen -and- participated with Ryan -in- sexual acts, -in- public, -after- I wrote the essay...yet I never hear anything of a reprimand in regards to her.\\"\\r\\nVasilis says, \\"I had a habit of ending those scenes with some excuse...because quite honest.\\"\\r\\nVasilis says, \\"I -really- don't feel like I can trust her as a person these days.\\"\\r\\n22:06:43 [INFO] Paka[delfina] loses her link.\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha suggests, \\"If you see players breaking the rules you should assist, and provide logs, please. We can't see everything, you see. But we really do try and be fair with each case in front of us.\\"\\r\\nYou nod acceptingly, \\"Lets separate Meerclar from the situation. We'll have myself and Tasha address the issue. On the point you've brought up about Ryan, while awkward you.. what she said. @assist. If you have logs of such events, feel free to send them to the email I gave you. We hold staffers to the same standards as all players.\\"\\r\\nVasilis says, \\"I understand that...but half of these people don't even like me already...so if I do tattle...and -somehow- it gets found out...where would that leave me?\\"\\r\\nYou express to Vasilis now, \\"When we notice players engaging in TS we follow a standard procedure that starts with a warning. Obviously with players that have gone past warnings to suspensions, we watch a bit more carefully. Truthfully? It isn't fun and we aren't paid anything, much less to be cops, but its like parole. People who have abused some element of the game or other tend to get watched a bit more carefully. Just being honest.\\"\\r\\nVasilis says, \\"Also...just feel odd that when Meer and myself had something of a falling out, only just two days later I get called up for this. I'm sure it was on her inclination, because she had Ryan at the bathhouse beforehand. I know you probably don't agree with me...but with everything just adding up in my head, it honestly just feels like a personal attack.\\"\\r\\nYou query Vasilis, \\"Do you keep logs?\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"We work hard to keep the assists confidential, always. If in some way the info gets out, like the player guesses it was you as you were the only one who knew, or soemthing like that, then you can assist again and we can try to sort it out. We encourage players to assist all the time, so hopefully it feels less like tattling and more like just what you do.\\"\\r\\nOOC -- You privately message StoryGuide Tasha, \\"I presume its the correct thing to do, to follow on his concerns?\\"\\r\\nVasilis says, \\"I kept all my logs on my old e-mail for easy access, but it got so spammed that I couldn't even log into it, without my net cutting off. I know someone who might have the same logs I have, so i'll have to ask that player.\\"\\r\\nOOC -- StoryGuide Tasha privately messages you, \\"sure, we can look into it, still, other people breaking rules does not make it ok to break them\\"\\r\\nYou agree with StoryGuide Tasha, \\"The more players use @assist even to ask questions or address simple concerns, the less traumatic it is if staff find anything.\\"\\r\\nOOC -- You privately message StoryGuide Tasha, \\"I agree with that.\\"\\r\\nOOC -- StoryGuide Tasha will be away from her keyboard.\\r\\nYou note to Vasilis, \\"I ask for the logs because if you are stating another player has been doing something too, we want to look into it. However, that still doesn't excuse your behavior.\\"\\r\\nYou consider.\\r\\nYou add too, \\"There is also something that isn't against the rules per se, but has been discussed between staff of a few different games recently. That is people taking brand new players, sometimes within hours of logging in for the first time for TS. I haven't pried into what was going on, but its been noted that you often seem to grab very new players and bring them up to a character's room for private RP. We have no real concern what players \> 18 do behind closed doors, but it does detract from the game if the first impression people get of it is as a TS chat room. We still haven't figured out how we want to address this problem, buts its one that is multiple games have noticed as an issue.\\"\\r\\nYou reassure Vasilis, \\"That has nothing to do with any ruling about the public TS, but it is something worth discussing while we're here. I'd be curious your thoughts on it, and ways to minimize that happening.\\"\\r\\nVasilis says to you, \\"Those are actually people I know it RL mostly. Espeically two people, who just make chars for the trial to RP with my chars however they deem so on a regular basis.\\"\\r\\nVasilis says, \\"Seems like a lot of people, I know...but it's really just 2-3 players I know that just keep making new chars for the trial for few days or a week.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Vasilis, \\"That's a relief actually. Its still a general problem in various Skotos games, and I'm at a loss at how to easily limit it without preventing legitimate RP. We could limit access to other people's rooms while on trial, but that takes away various RP opportunities.\\"\\r\\nVasilis says, \\"If anything...might be more of a better idea to get rid of all the -exclusive RPing-. I know you've seen it...people sticking to their little -clique- of players because they have similar interests or just RP better.\\"\\r\\nVasilis says, \\"When it comes to newer players, i've seen most just push them aside and wait till -they become better-...and it's not exactly leaving a good impression...these days it's hard to have a conversation with someone you don't regularly RP with, without them finding some awkward excuse to leave...or they just leave you in mid-conversation without warning.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Vasilis, \\"Ideally alts minimize that as they should be interacting with different groups of characters, but that is hard to minimize as there are IC reasons to interact with one group or another. Of course, it would be great if we could provide greater incentives to interact with more characters.\\"\\r\\nYou return your words, \\"Anyway, back to the prior topic.\\"\\r\\nVasilis says, \\"Yes, back to the prior topic.\\"\\r\\nYou ask Vasilis curiously, \\"What are your thoughts. Obviously, you have engaged in public TS since the prior issues. You've also been suspended once for TS (though not due to being public). Obviously you did know about the restriction. What are your thoughts on possible responses?\\"\\r\\nYou note too, \\"If you just want us to read off a reply based on history, we can do it without input as well, but I'm curious about getting player input.\\"\\r\\nVasilis says, \\"The issues before this incident, and after the essay never escalated past flirtation, and I tried to keep in mind that when things evolved into the start of a TS scene, to move it off to the cathouse or Don or Vajhira's room. I knew about the restriction, and I tried to abide by it as best as I could, knowing what was at stake...this time I messed up bad, and I know I did...but the punishment still feels somewhat overly-severe...but i'm done complaining about that. As for the responses, I don't know what to expect, since the verdict is still up to you guys, and all I can really do is plead my case.\\"\\r\\n22:29 [LocalGame\|Spot] \\"Tasha, you there?\\"\\r\\n22:29 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"sort of, family stuff going on here\\"\\r\\n22:30 [LocalGame\|Spot] \\"What are your thoughts.

You see, it was going to be a 3 month suspension anyway, then he yelled at Meer and refused to talk, so we felt we needed to up it to a ban. Now he logs on unfairly in a new account, and we lessen it? Is that what happened, we caught him in this new account, or did he contact us to talk ooc? still, he has Az's email, he should have talked there, not make a new account and sneakily do it\\"\\r\\nVasilis shrugs to StoryGuide Tasha, \\"I really don't know...last time I talked to Az, and pleaded my case, he pretty much made it seem like it was useless to...especially when he told me that the decisions are made prior to the conversation taking place. Then again, guess i'm kind of confused now, too.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha asks, \\"May I be frank?\\"\\r\\nYou nod acceptingly, \\"So no specific mitigating factors in this case, but you admit it was a screw up. Because you have been suspended for TS related things before and clearly were aware of the expectations, we do need to do some sort of suspension at a minimum. Generally after a suspension we do an indefinite ban. Ie. You're banned for minimum of X months, but then can ask to get reinstated. Logging on with a new account and not just @assisting from it saying it was an OOC thing is a bad sign to be frank. Perhaps we should talk to Az to make sure the Host is behind whatever we do as the situation is complicated.\\"\\r\\nYou peer at StoryGuide Tasha, \\"I thought you were Tasha.\\"\\r\\n22:34 [LocalGame\|Spot] \\"I incorporated your preference for taking this to Az.\\"\\r\\n22:35 [TAS] \\"\<#16816/New\> filed by Fergie[delfina]: And my pearl has also changed, it just dropped the colour purple.\\"\\r\\n22:35 [LocalGame\|Spot] \\"Its true that he claims emails weren't working, but he could have assisted.\\"\\r\\n22:35 [LocalGame\|Spot] \\"Looks more like he was trying to play the char before Cade caught it.

We spoke to the other player. You logged off before we could talk to you. Then Meerclar tried to talk to you again, and you felt there was no way you could get out of it, so before she could even tell you what the consequence of your rule breaking would be, you logged out again. Refusing to talk to staff makes it rather hard for us to sort out a compromise, to hear your side of it. I hear now that you are having ooc problems with Meerclar, so I get that it was hard. But you could have requested another staffer talk to you. Instead, you create a new account and try to play despite being banned, and when you get caught at that too, you say that you wanted to contact staff but couldn't get email through (not saying that didn't happen, just that you had other options to contact us...like assisting immediately when making a new account, or posting a private message thing in the forums to one of the staff...etc. Now we are talking to you, I really appreciate that you admit you did the wrong thing, but the only mitigating circumstance you can provide, as far as I can tell is that other people do it too.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"lots of people do the wrong thing, lots of people in RL steal, still a crime, for example.\\"\\r\\n[Broadcast] Who is up for a StP sale in the Tavern? @page Spot.

Likewise, if you think I am being unfair, tell me and I will look into it, or ask the Host to look into me, make sure I am being fair.\\"\\r\\nOOC -- Vasilis says, \\"Actually the first time I was willing to talk but as pretty much most of the playerbase knows, my net cuts off at 11:00-12:30 due to matainence issues on my buildings wi-fi which they're trying to fix. Second time I got angry...which i'll admit because with the way everything was adding up in my head, it ticked me off to no end, and I -really- didn't feel like speaking to Meerclar of all people so I left before I really started bitching at her in general. Yeah...I could've contacted the staff as soon as I made the char, but I knew you guys would find me in only a few minutes, because whenever I try to assist about anything it takes -forever- to get a response.

Works for me.\\r\\nAbel / Kilisma: Where should we begin?\\r\\nmeerclar: Right, so first I'd like to make sure that you know why you were banned in the first place, so that there can be absolutely no misunderstandings\\r\\nAbel / Kilisma: I was bannd for TSing in public, despite previous warnings and being offered a bit of leniency in the matter. Also the fact that I did it in the baths, a place which I strongly suggested nobody TSing in my report made it all the worse, because I -knew- it wasn't allowed there. Also, my behavour and choice of words after towards the staff could've been handled better and a lot my civilly by myself.\\r\\nmeerclar: We were actually only going to probably suspend you, but you told us to ban you and logged off, so we did.\\r\\nmeerclar: Which is why we're willing to talk to you about coming back. You made your own punishment worse, and your suspension would have been well over by now\\r\\nAbel / Kilisma: Yeah, I know. Don't know what I was going through my head back then. I just made the situation even worse for myself with my behaviour.\\r\\nmeerclar: Alright. So...\\r\\nmeerclar: Has your situation changed, or has something changed that makes you think that the previous problems won't happen again?\\r\\nAbel / Kilisma: I think that it has. I've matured on some levels after taking the time to sit down by myself and really think about my past actions from my first offense with alt abuse with Adonis till now. Only thing I was doing was possibly compromising the game for everyone with my actions...especially if someone decided to make a case to the CE. I was being selfish, and not thinking past what -I- wanted to\\r\\nmeerclar: Do you feel that it would be helpful to come up with some strategies to avoid similar problems in the future, or do you think that is unlikely to be necessary? I know its easy to fall into a pattern when playing a character.\\r\\nAbel / Kilisma: do in most cases, and I wasn't cooperating to make the game better for everyone, which i should've been doing from the start. Instead I just repeatedly violated the TOS without so much as a afterthought. The ban/suspension was justified because I was in the wrong. I plan on being more careful with my actions, because I know I can do just that. It's time I grew up and really just think.\\r\\nmeerclar: Or perhaps strategies of what to do when / if you feel yourself getting frustrated\\r\\nAbel / Kilisma: If I feel myself getting frustrated, I can always log off. I no longer feel compelled to force myself to keep playing, so it should be much easier to work though. If it's frustration with another player, i'll be more than willing to work it out through a discussion with them, instead of just holding in the aggrivation.\\r\\nmeerclar: Also remember that the guides are there to help with any problems, so you should always page us or assist\\r\\nAbel / Kilisma: I really don't think i'll fall back into the pattern I was in before, but if it happens, i'll do my best to assess the situation and contact staff about what's okay and what's not okay.\\r\\nmeerclar: When we were watching you play before, we did notice that your behavour and attitudes seemed to have changed, and that you weren't making any trouble, which is great.\\r\\nAbel / Kilisma: I was watching my toes. Almost got thrusted into some awkward situations, but I diverted things to a more safer route. I'm not looking to cause anymore trouble if I can help it.\\r\\nmeerclar: If you come back, do you know if you would want to make new characters, or keep some old ones?\\r\\nAbel / Kilisma: I'd like to keep Vajhira and Don...mostly because of the investment I put into them. Not really sure about abel...think he's too fargone to really salvage, and I can't even remember my other two characters...so they're not going to be missed.\\r\\nmeerclar: funny, we were just talking about vajhira ic last night\\r\\nAbel / Kilisma: Really?\\r\\nmeerclar: yeah\\r\\nAbel / Kilisma: Heh\\r\\nAbel / Kilisma: It wasn't about the bikini thing, was it? That's the only thing I ever remember people talking about when she was concerned.\\r\\nmeerclar: Sang and Ryan were talking about her\\r\\nAbel / Kilisma: Ah\\r\\nmeerclar: Alright. I think you seem to have moved past the things that caused the problems before, and I really hope you'll talk to staff if any more problems come up before they become problems. I'm going to unban you, and you can come back, but I'd really like to talk to you in a week or two to see how things are going, if that's alright\\r\\nAbel / Kilisma: Alright, that works for me. I'll keep in touch with you periodically.\\r\\nmeerclar: That would be good\\r\\nmeerclar: And I'm on here a lot too\\r\\nAbel / Kilisma: I noticed :)\\r\\nmeerclar: done.

I didn't do anything about that as I hoped the the RP ban would help things calm, but Azrael instructed me to keep that log in case similar things came up in the future.

Amazing how people can become so irked over things that occur in a game and it amazingly seems to have some degree of a impact on their RL things. Tried picking a better -vocabulary-, but Vaj is just Vulgar these days when she's pissed, so she's going to cuss. This is just my opinion, but having it affect RL to even the slightest degree over a game is really just odd. It's understandable, but I can't quite wrap my head around it, and people could've told me OOCly or through Message. If they let me know, I would've toned it down..and I wasn't hunting down Aluine. I was hunting down Random. He's one of my boyfriends alts, and he decided to actually drag him out for once.

Perhaps we're talking about different scenes. Regardless, to me it reflects a general use of language.\\"\\r\\n\> Vajhira says, \\"Oh you mean back when I went verbally apeshit on him, and I requested for the staff to pull me up? Yeah, I was royally pissed at his player.

If I remember all of this happened before I filed for the alt interaction ban. About 2 days prior actually.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou straightforwardly tell Vajhira, \\"I was told that given all the past disciplines and conversations to ban you. I was essentially ordered to. In reality I feel it should be obvious that in games like this simply using vulgarity so extensively will make people uncomfy. I pushed back because I think you do try and you do listen, and I hadn't spoken to you yet about general vulgarities, only epithets to specific RL groups. Still, I have to be really clear. This isn't just a person or two, and has nothing to do with Khagra or Helen.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou inform Vajhira seriously, \\"You need to find better ways to express yourself, whether its you getting upset OOC, or a char getting upset in the game.

Jahren and Khagra are alts.\\r\\n00:51 [TAS] \\"\<#15231/New\> filed by Jahren[phoenixbd]: At first there was no problem with what went on with Gero in the commons, but a lot of players expressed displeasure that his alt - Danae- randomly pop back into town and be the investigating officer of his alt's case. Never before have a group of people been charged with a full Assault charge in defense of other people, but in this case, his alt made it happen. There might be a crossover of alt abuse here. This isn't my personal opinion, but from the people involved I felt obligated to make it an assist.\\"\\r\\n01:06 [TAS] \\"\<#15232/New\> filed by Geradan[loki_ms]: I'm a fan of Jahren's player, so I don't want to tattle, but Khagra and his whole crew turned up in the commons when a) Jahren was already there, relating to b) The big melee where Gero and Khagra were involved. I didn't mind Jahren being there, knowing he's Khagra's alt, but having the alt that has more of a reason to want things to go his way, influencing things, kinda feels like the bad kind of alt-interaction.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Thanks for putting the assist in. The way the crime system works, though, is that nobody gets arrested unless there is evidence, and Danae shouldn't be actively investigating. So whether they get arrested for assault while defending people or not will depend on the testimonies, rather than what Geradan or any alts do.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"I offered OOCly to Danae that I put it up myself, but he ignored my @msg at that point. Several people IG were already made to confess and pay fines and be banned from Docktown as is.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"I'm speaking on behalf of other people here, to be honest with you. And I agree with their assessment once I had a look at it clearly\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Hmm, what do you mean? Did anyone IC call Danae in? And did Danae actively try to make them confess?\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"I'm not too worried who put the crime up in the system - since really any constable should put a crime up if requested, so that doesn't give any real advantage. But if Danae actively investigated and tried to get convictions, then that's more problematic. Do you have logs?\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Neither Jahren nor Khagra saw anyone call Danae in. She just showed up and took over the case. And charged everyone who fought against Geradan with a regular assault charge.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Which in reality, any other constable would make it a disturbing the peace charge at worst\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Probably - although again, I'm not too worried about whatever charges were given. Theoretically Danae could have put in murder charges and it wouldn't matter - since they can't be arrested unless there are testimonies (and people shouldn't be testifying that it was murder if it wasn't)\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"It is valid to put in assault charges (or assault charges AND disturbing the peace) for people who are fighting - whether they get convicted should be based on what the people testify\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"(for example, I know Faile has even been charged with murder, for self defence)\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"In this case, everyone involved were moving to defend other people. They were all second and last to pull weapons. Danae puts them all as being charged with assault. Which is a false charge, and I dunno if it is alt-based biased or not. I know Josh and Jahren both would charge the defending people with minor Disturbing the Peace at maximum which is reasonable considering\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"(and that was someone attacking her directly. So drawing deadly weapons and attacking someone that isn't directly threatenign you is quite plausible as assault. Again, I'm trying not to make any value judgement as to who was in the right or wrong, since I want that to be sorted out by PCs if it's IC. But I do want to make sure there is no OOC abuse or alt assistance)\\"\\r\\n\> [OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Wouldn't maximum disturbing the peace actually be a higher charge than normal assault?\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Even after people testified that Geradan was the aggressor, and ever when he tried to take a hostage... His alt still set up everyone that he attacked with normal charge of assault. Which is false, it should be minor disturbance of peace at worst. It's like saying you seen someone getting gang beat on the streets IRL and you went to defend them makes you a total criminal\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"But has anyone testified that those people were guilty, so they had to get arrested? Just because a crime is entered into the system doesn't mean there is any evidence - and if there is no evidence then the constables can't arrest them\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"(and I point out that in your example - if you pull out a knife and go to defend that person getting beaten up then yes, you can be charged with assault. Seriously. In the modern day.)\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"(My ex-housemate has a police charge of assault because a gang tried to mug him and his friends while they were on the way back from sword training. And he picked up his sword and said \\"Seriously, you don't want to mug us, just leave us alone\\" and got charged with assault for threatening someone with a deadly weapon. He would have possibly faced jail time, but got let off because the people trying to mug them were armed with knives.)\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Maybe in your country, I dunno. But where I'm from, if you pull a weapon clearly in defense of another person, the judge -will- let it off. It's called the 'good sumaritan' laws....\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"You'll want to be *very* careful about using the good samaritan law. We have that here, too. It does not apply if you \\"escalate the conflict\\" and other cases - it is extremely limited. Mostly the good samaritan law applies to people who *aren't* doing violence, but accidentally hurt someone. For example, a doctor that tries to treat your injuries and might accidentally make them worse due to not having the right information.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"But that's another topic. The one at hand is...\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"1) Whether Danae is out of line with putting in the charge of assault. I haven't seen the logs but it sounds like it's a reasonable charge considering people did draw weapons, or possibly use them.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"2) Whether Danae is out of line for investigating a situation wothout having IC information to make her arrive, or possibly investigating to help an alt. I don't know the situation, or what Danae did - but please send log files if you think that Danae was out of line.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Well lets look at it IG. Gero started the violence, drew weapons and even made the the first strike. Everyone else present jumped in and gave him a couple of bumps. They all get regular ASSAULT CHARGES for defending injured people. His alt makes the charges. People complain to me OOC.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"There's no reason for Danae to suddenly pop back up. And then she knows everything that went on, and puts total assault charges for people that fought against her very violent and criminally inclined alt.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"and 3) Whether people testified against the people. Again, I remind you that a constable *MUST* put in any charges that someone requests, as long as they are plausible. It's plausible that there should be a charge of assault against people who draw weapons to use in a fight. Whether someone gets *arrested* is based on the evidence. If things are as clear cut as you say, then there should be zero evidence, and nobody should get arrested. So life goes on as usual. It's the ICO equivalent of the judge letting you off due to good samaritan laws.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"The only reason Khagra and Noire accepted their charges is because they're trying hard to be good people. The fact remains is that Gero used his alt to give big charges against people who fought against his alt. They tried to explain to his alt (Danae) that they were acting in defense of other people and their Clan property (Anabella) but she wouldn't entertain it at all.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"What outcome are you hoping from this conversation? You and I both know that Geradan is entitle to file charges of whatever he wants. Maybe he should have filed them through Jahren instead of Danae - but we both know he's allowed to file the charges of assault. So we can't do anything about that. I've already said I'll look over any logs you can provide to see if it looks like Danae was being unfair or helping alts.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"If Khagra and Noire accepted the charges because they were OOC told to, then that's bad. If they accepted their charges IC without evidence against them, because they're trying to be good, then that's an IC decision. People could have pointed out to them that there's no need to accept charges (or even go the the jail) if there isn't evidence.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"We also both know that if there was enough evidence to arrest them, Danae needs to arrest them. And can't let them off because they tell a good story (since that should have been taken into account in the @crime system already)\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Did you and Heidi both try to tell me you were all over alt abuse? This is a case that bears real looking into, Tony. Seriously. I know what you have to do, you have to do. But if you were really watching what happened IG and seeing it, we shouldn't be having this convo. You'd be talking to Gero/Danae's player right now.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"What have I asked you to do multiple times?\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"I put in my assist, and I know now that not just me did\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"quote: I don't know the situation, or what Danae did - but please send log files if you think that Danae was out of line.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"quote: I haven't seen the logs\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"quote: I want that to be sorted out by PCs if it's IC.

Do you have logs?\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"There weren't any logs against me with Scarlett's player, but I got grilled by Meerclar pretty good. So why does it need to be required now? Can't you ask some questions?\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Of course I can ask questions. But if I know what happened, that does make it easier, wouldn't you say?\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Please, when I can give you four quotes from me - in this very conversation - asking for information so I can look into the possible alt abuse - please don't be so rude as to imply that when we say we look into alt abuse, that we would ignore this case for some unknown reason. Or to imply that we wouldn't look into it.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"As you yourself said: \\"if you were really watching what happened IG and seeing it, we shouldn't be having this convo. You'd be talking to Gero/Danae's player right now.\\" - I obviously wasn't watching what happened, which is why I asked for logs. Now that I know you don't have logs, I won't ask, but you hadn't told me that you had no logs (or if you had, I'd missed it) - I'll get logs from Gero's player, and look into it.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"And why do you assume there were no assists about Scarlett? Since you know we're not in the habit of telling players about other players assists.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"When I was snagged up into staff-land to appease Scarlett's player, I bet she didn't have much in the way of logs. If she did, then when I asked if so, I'd have been told yes or no, rather than a neutral answer\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"I also note that - even now, it's been a long time - but you are still sore about being questioned about what happened with Scarlett. Yet you're expecting me to do similar to Geradan. So I'd like you to bear that in mind - staff often talk to players - often players who feel they have done no wrong - so that we can look into situations like this and make sure the game is played fairly.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"If geradan asks if Jahren has logs of his behavior, what do you think I'm going to tell him? \\"No, there is no evidence that you did anything wrong at all, other than one players word. Would you mind sending me your logs and incriminating yourself?\\" - or would I perhaps not tell him whether you have logs or not. Since that way we can always give the same answer every time that question is asked.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"So you're just not going to ask any questions at all?\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Please. Stop. Read over our conversation. Don't assume you already know what I'm saying. Read the words I'm saying.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"I didn't get so deep into this until prompted. I was asking if you were going to ask questions about it. People complained to me, so I assist on the behalf of many players here.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"So I'll ask the same you are asking of me.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Did you not see how many times I asked for logs? Why would I be asking for those logs if I didn't want to look into it. Did you not see me say that I could ask questions? Did you not see me ask you not to be rude and imply that we wouldn't look into this?\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Sorry no complicated logs. But that obviously was required in order to tell me to be nicer IG to two other players I had to mediate discussions with even tho I told them OOCly I liked them as a player despite differences IG.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"No logs were provided against me when staff told me to be nicer IG.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Think back. What did we ask you to do? We said \\"Scarlett feels like you were being rude just walking out and leaving her with nobody to RP with when there are no other players online.\\" you said \\"I don't do that\\" and so we said \\"Good. So you agree you won't do that (which you aren't anyway) and Scarlett is happy? Good.\\" - if you weren't doing it anyway, I'm not sure what this huge \\"appeasement\\" that staff made you do was. Since you wouldn't be changing any behavior at all. Nobody called you a liar, or said you did anything you didn't do.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Now, unlike that situation, in *this* one I'm going to be talking to Geradan, and looking at whether he did something wrong. Possibly punishing him. Asking or telling him to actually change his behavior (rather than to continue doing what he's already doing) - and all without logs. I'm still going to talk to him. I'll see if he can give me logs, and if not, I'll listen to his side of the story to try and get the big picture.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"All I want you to realize is that your complaints of how supposedly badly treated you were in regards to Scarlett - I want you to realize that talking to players, and coming up with compromises is what we do. It's something you have regularly asked us to do towards other players. I want you to realize that in *one* instance we were asked to do it towards you, and did so. That is not unreasonable.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"And I want you to realize that what happened to you with Scarlett, you are asking me to do more than that to another player. Which I will do.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Anyway, I've got to leave now. I'll be talking to Geradan about why his potential alt Danae was there, and looking at whether that was unfair when I have time. I'll also be talking to you about why Khagra and Jahren were there, and looking at whether that was unfair when I have time. Until I talk to both of you, and feel I have a reasonable version of the big picture, I won't be assuming anyone did anything wrong. I will be keeping an open mind, and doing what I can to reduce unfair alt use.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Take care, I'll see you later\\"" \}), (\{ "tonyd", 1255147891, "Willem arrives.\\r\\nYou wave.\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar arrives.\\r\\nYou eye StoryBuilder Morana, \\"You're so sneaky.\\"\\r\\nWillem waves.\\r\\nYou ask Willem, \\"So what's the story?\\"\\r\\nStoryBuilder Morana grins at you.\\r\\nStoryBuilder Morana approaches a carousel.\\r\\nStoryBuilder Morana sits down on a carousel horse.\\r\\nWillem asks you, \\"You don't need to know about the fight itself, I imagine?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"From what I understand, Gero and Khagra got in a fight.

And bring it up if you think Danae does anything unfairly.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Yeah, so I'm not seeing any issue here.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar says, \\"So the problem seems to be when geradan then goes out and tries to get people to put testemonies in?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Well, Khagra's assist is \\"At the time I thought it was fair, but later I realised how horribly unfair it was, and I'd even offered to have Jahren do the charges instead.\\"\\r\\nStoryBuilder Morana wonders, \\"Why would it be any more fair to have Jahren do the charges instead of Danae?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Danae's assist was about the later situation where Geradan was talking to Jahren, and Khagra turned up to support Jahren.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar says, \\"Khagra is very good at changing him mind later about how things were fair or unfair.\\"\\r\\nYou tell StoryBuilder Morana, \\"It wouldn't.\\"\\r\\nStoryBuilder Morana nods to you, \\"Exactly, to me it seems he's upset that Gero is pushing for testimonies.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Danae charges them with assault, since they all used weapons. They say they had to. Danae points out she's not carrying a sword, and there's a reason constables use non-lethal force.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Seems a reasonable argument for charges of assault (and is something Danae has done before on other cases)\\"\\r\\nStoryBuilder Morana says, \\"And if he had Khagra show up to 'support' Jahren, who is his own alt, then that would be crossover would it not?\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar says, \\"I don't have a problem if danae came, in put in reasonable testeonies, and then stepped ack from the whole thing, leaving gero to push for the testemonies.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Khagra tries to take responsibility for everyone *else* that joined in the fight.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Danae says he can only do that for his own slaves.\\"\\r\\nStoryBuilder Morana agrees with StoryGuide Meerclar, \\"That's a good way to go about it.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar nods.\\r\\nYou say, \\"Nod to Khagra \\"I will present the case to the magistrates. At present, as it appears that Geradan was the aggressor, I have charged with with Major assault and disturbing the peace. You will only be charged with a standard assault charge.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar nods, \\"Sounds very fair to me.\\"\\r\\nStoryBuilder Morana agrees.\\r\\nYou say, \\"Khagra relays to you comfortably, \\"I will accept a normal assault charge, under the conditions Noire is not charged. Or that you charge us both with minor charge of disturbance of the peace. Otherwise, I will not confess officially.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Tell Khagra \\"You have already confessed to me. To testify otherwise now will be lying in your testimony.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Adonis tells Khagra, \\"She's right...little too late to try to make demands now.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Adonis explains to Khagra helpfully, \\"Khagra...the law dosen't take sides. The miss isn't trying to make you the bad guy here...she's just following the Rinaldi laws without getting her personal opinions into the mix. Fighting in the commons is -still- a crime according to the Rinaldi...despite how good or sound the reasoning is.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar says, \\"And Khagra can't demand that someone isn't charged anyway. He -can- go in and testify on her behalf though.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And... I think that pretty much sums up the problem. Adonis is entirely right, and has outlined Danae's duty. And Jahren's duty. Which should have resulted in the same thing if both players were being fair.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar nods agreeingly.\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar says, \\"Danae seems to have been in the right in this, provided that Danae wasn't investigating, or following up on the case later.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Tell Khagra tiredly \\"You defended yourselves by drawing blades and attacking. Not only that, you defended -other- people by drawing blades and attacking. I have dealt with this monkey before, he will weasel his way out of a full charge by saying that you attacked him before he attacked you, making you the aggressor.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Pretty fair comment. Talking about alts, but also giving a good IC explanation of what Geradan usually does, and why they need to charge the fighters and let the evidence say who gets punished.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar nods agreeingly.\\r\\nYou say, \\"Khagra relents simply, \\"Fine. You'll have my confession to a 'standard assault' charge. However, for the record it displeases me that it will sound like we outrightly ambushed the drunken pirate.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"(I note that Danae - at no point - asked for a confession. Khagra just assumed she wanted one. She only asked questions to decide what charges to put in.)\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar nods agreeingly.\\r\\nYou say, \\"Adonis hopefully eases Khagra's mind with his smooth, dulcet voice, \\"She's giving you a standrard charge...and you know that everyone in the commons will most likely come to your defense, if they testify.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Noire smiles at Khagra encouragingly, \\"Yes, it's you against a pirate. And you're so cute, who'd testify against you?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"DANAE says: You tell Khagra, \\"You are a man of good standing, simply pay the fine and be done with it.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"So that's the first time that Danae has actively influenced Khagra one way or the other on accepting the charges.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Khagra comments to you grumpily, \\"I will, and I will be. No one will need testify on my behalf. Can we sort this today?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You tell Khagra, \\"It will probably be a 5 or 10 denari fine at worst.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar says, \\"and that was after he said he would accept the charges.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Yep. Then they go the the jail to sort it out.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar says, \\"Sounds all fair to me then.\\"\\r\\nStoryBuilder Morana agrees, \\"So to this point it sounds like Danae is completely in the clear.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I don't have a log about the second incident, so we can't really comment on Jahren being unfair bringing in Khagra or not.\\"\\r\\nYou agree with StoryBuilder Morana and StoryGuide Meerclar.\\r\\nStoryBuilder Morana suggests, \\"Can we get a log of the event from Gero or maybe Jahren?\\"\\r\\nYou nod to StoryBuilder Morana, \\"I thought he was going to email it. So maybe the email was delayed or something else.\\"\\r\\nStoryBuilder Morana nods.\\r\\nYou ask, \\"What do we think of Jahren? In that discussion, he didn't seem to be causing any problems either.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Resisting the charges, I didn't post it all, but arguing a lot about how they shouldn't be charged for defending people... but not doing anything OOC wrong.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar admits, \\"I think I'm biased against him at the moment.\\"\\r\\nStoryBuilder Morana asks StoryGuide Meerclar, \\"Jahren?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"(although playing a constable - I do think it's important that he does know the laws and when assault charges can be put in. And understands that any charges can and should be put in if reasonable.)\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar nods to StoryBuilder Morana.\\r\\nStoryBuilder Morana asks StoryGuide Meerclar, \\"Why's that?\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar says, \\"And I doubt that he was making khagra be IC wrong....\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar tells StoryBuilder Morana, \\"Various and lengthy reaonss.\\"\\r\\nStoryBuilder Morana nods easily.\\r\\nStoryBuilder Morana says, \\"Well being an unbias party for not having been around in nearly a year, I can't see any fault on Gero's part on how he's handled all of this. Mind you until we get a log from the second part of the incident we can't necessarily say Jahren is at fault either, but so far it doesn't point in his favor persay.\\"\\r\\nStoryBuilder Morana moves from a carousel horse to StoryGuide Meerclar.\\r\\nYou say, \\"I also note that he asked us to investigate Danae for this days after it happened (when he changed his mind) and while refusing to give logs.

Well, for someone else to be treated fairly.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"we are happy to treat everyone fairly.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"Everyone is being treated fairly, from what I see.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha asks Sir Althalus curiously, \\"What in the world do you think we seek to gain by not treating Lia fairly? I assume you mean Lia?\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"Part of what you need is Ryan's support to free Lia, which Althalus doesn't have.\\"\\r\\nYou agree, \\"We treat everyone similary. Other players were asked to do the same. Exactly the same. You too. You can go to other slavers too and get their support.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"Then how is Flynn and Ryan selling Caliste back to the Avo because they think they are going to free her against the slavers will ICly fair compared to the hoops I have to jump through to give a single promotion token?\\"\\r\\nYou ask Sir Althalus, \\"Does Caliste have any promotion made?\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"She isn't free. They will have to go through the same to get freed, I imagine.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"If not then I don't see how it compares.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"If she is asked to be spent a token on, she'l have to obtain permit of the slavers too.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus tells you, \\"Well it sounds like ICly I have to get \\"support\\" but the Avo can just tell the slavers \\"We're freeing her, deal with it.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael reminds Sir Althalus, \\"We've already spoken about Caliste. I've already told you that, to free Caliste, they will have to do the exact same actions as you are doing. I've already reassured you that any rules about freeing slaves - although they may change over time - are always applied to *all* slave PCs equally.\\"\\r\\nRyan tells Sir Althalus, \\"What happened with Caliste was IC. There was IC reason behind it.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"Even if you don't know all the details.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Sir Althalus, \\"If they manage to get the permit IG, that is IG. You have to get the permit IG too. The same permit. How you do it IG, is IG and up to your RP. however not up to ooc complaining that permit is unnecessary.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"And a BIG ooc one.\\"\\r\\nYou ask Sir Althalus, \\"So your issue is what happens with Caliste instead of what happens with Lia?\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus snorts, \\"I have all sorts of issues at the moment.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods, \\"So, in this specific case.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"1) Do you feel that the requirements for getting a promotion token given to Lia are clear?\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"Npo.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"No.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"OK. Let me explain what the requirements are.\\"\\r\\n08:02 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"What a douche, seriously\\"\\r\\n08:03 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"wow, he is so hurtful when he doesn't get what he wants, you reckon he would be the same or meaner if we were not his RL friends?\\"\\r\\n08:04 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"He is throwing a tantrum. Lia has been pointing fingers and poisining his perceptive. She is jealous over Caliste. She is pissed staff said, that it is unreasonable and OOC Lia is favored by the Avo and Caliste is ignored. So she hurts him in return.\\"\\r\\n08:04 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I am amused though. Just now, I stated exactly, spelled out word by word what is needed.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"You must get two higher ranking Doloreaux members - that is, two doloreaux members other than Althalus, who are gentry ranked or above - and they must write and sign a scroll that says \\"I give my support towards having Lia freed\\" - then you must send those scrolls to Sirazad. The scrolls must not indicate that they have reservations towards Lia being freed. You must also get the same sent from a representative of the slavers. That could be an active slaver, or it could be Ryan who does much of the slavers administration.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael asks, \\"Are those instructions clear, or should I clarify?\\"\\r\\n08:05 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"He'd be the same if we weren't RL friends, yes\\"\\r\\n08:05 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"But only after he feels he \\"knows\\" us\\"\\r\\n08:05 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"What a great friend\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus asks StoryHost Azrael, \\"Are these IC scrolls? And if so, who are they being sent to IC?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"They are IC scrolls, and you can roleplay that they are being sent back to Bruges, as a request for the NPC Doloreaux nobility to put pressure on the NPC Rinaldi nobility to get this slave freed.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"And if we're freeing a slave via putting pressure on the Rinaldi, what is the point of the scrolls from the slavers?\\"\\r\\n08:07 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"He knows what is needed. He just wants to argue that he didn't, because he knew he didn't have what he needed and was trying to bully Sirazad into doing it anyway\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Uhm... Lady Greta. Or Lord Henrik. They are people back home who deal with house matters. Burges. You can send them to the clerk of house archives too.\\"\\r\\n08:07 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I totally know he was trying to bully me.\\"\\r\\n08:07 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"That is why I am angry\\"\\r\\n08:07 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"He seems most pissed that he needs ryan's permission\\"\\r\\n08:08 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"He can get Faile's or Flynns or get someone hired by them etc.\\"\\r\\n08:08 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"He is pissed there is someone he can not OOCly force\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"I thought the promotion tokens were the incentive for the slavers to release a slave. I mean, just judging by what Dolo promotions have gone for on the AH, that's an amount around 150 thousand denari.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"Because the Doloreaux nobles won't want to go to the cost and risk of pressuring the Rinaldi, and then finding the slavers are unwilling to sell the slave or allow it to be freed. Slaves are, after all, property. And the Doloreaux don't have the right to walk into Triskellian and legally take someone's property.\\"\\r\\n08:09 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"coz he thinks that Ryan will be the hardest to get, whereas he can push the house members about more easily as a whole as he has something to offer them\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"You are welcome to offer promotion tokens to the slavers, to entice them into supporting Lia being freed. Or whatever other in-game actions you can think of.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus tells StoryHost Azrael, \\"Which doesn't make sense ICly, because of the Ryan and Flynn thing.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"What ryan and flynn thing?\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus snorts, \\"Come off it. Yay, lets increase the price of freeing a slave even more than it's ridiculous amount.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"Only if you can't think of anything else to covince them.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"It was a big deal freeing a slave, it hardly ever happened.\\"\\r\\n08:10 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"Yeah, he has no OOC power over ryan\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus tells StoryGuide Tasha, \\"Which is WHY it's three freaking promotion tokens!\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"150 thousand denari!\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha means, \\"historically, I mean it took generation after generation, not a few months.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Sir Althalus, \\"All slaves, when become slaves are clearly told, the price isn't a kiss on the feet. They know, what they agree to. We ask them thrice if they understand and accept.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods, \\"We specifically warn them that it is unlikely that they will ever be IG freed.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"Anyway, the cost isn't really part of this discussion. You know what is required. The cost is just the in-game cost.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus tells StoryHost Azrael, \\"of course it's part of the discussion, it's all related.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"I don't see how whether Althalus needs to bribe people or whether he used his powers of pursuasion, or holds something over them to get them to agree to what he wants is really part of this discussion.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods, \\"It's related, in that it's the IC cost. And has been for years. But this is a discussion about the OOC problems. When things are resolved, you're welcome to talk to the plotters, if you need help with the IC aspects.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha asks Sir Althalus again, \\"What is the Ryan and Flynn thing?\\"\\r\\nYou disagree, \\"It is not related. The cost has been the same since I play the game. It always was. You never minded it. It is fair, as it is applied to all in the same manner. It is universal and unbiased. Lowering it for Lia... now how would that be fair?\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"The cost is the same, the hoops have changed.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"How would you know? How many slaves have you freed?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael states, \\"This is a game of politics. You need to perform political actions to achieve your objective. The hoops will continue to change for various activities as we build the game of politics.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"However, the hoops are the same for everyone.\\"\\r\\nYou mention to StoryHost Azrael, \\"There wasn't really a change actually. All the slaves that were freed were done so the same way. So yes, the same is requested as was with other slaves.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael notes also, \\"And the hoops really haven't changed. We have required support from other house members before promotions are given for years. The only difference in this case is, when promoting a slave, it also requires permission from the slavers. When Rocher was freed, the slavers were approached and gave permission before it happened.\\"\\r\\n08:15 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"Lianaar was asked about Rocher and agreed. The house of the Avoirdupois stood behind Rocher fully. There was no other slave freeing since I am IG.\\"\\r\\n08:16 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"He's just whinging because he has Lia complaining in his ear, and she's practically his girlfriend\\"\\r\\nYou add, \\"The other times slavers had their say too. They were asked to give their vote.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus repeats, \\"And the Ryan and Flynn thing is that one one hand, I've got you people telling me I need slavers support, because the Doloreaux won't put pressure on the Rinaldi to free her, but ICly, Ryan and Flynn sold Caliste back to the Avo ICly because they couldn't stop her from being freed if the Avo wanted her freed.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"You are being asked for specific written support from the members - but that's not unsurprising.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"Actually, Ryan had other IC motivation, that you are clearly unaware of.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael points at Ryan, \\"You've told Sirazad a few times that you have the support of the slavers, but yet the PC in question tells us that he doesn't support it. So we need written support to make sure there are no confusions or misunderstandings.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus snorts, \\"IC or OOC? What happened to \\"Caliste doesn't want to be owned by any of the houses.\\"\\r\\n08:17 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"She really is, isn't she. It is so messed up.\\"\\r\\nRyan tells Sir Althalus, \\"OOC she didn't mind being owned by them. IC Ryan had a reason to do sell her to them.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"I was told that OOCly.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"The OOC rules still apply. If Caliste's player tells us she doesn't want to be owned by a specific master or guild, then she won't be. And, as we have told you MANY times, for Caliste to be freed, the same permission and support will need to be IC given as for Lia.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha tells Sir Althalus again, \\"Who owns a slave is a very sensitive ooc matter and we work hard to make sure ooc the players are happy with who they are with. The leader of the Avo house changed, dude.\\"\\r\\n08:19 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I still feel he lied to me deliberately. The package didn't include slaver support at all.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael also says, \\"And I really don't want to discuss Caliste any more. We've stated repeatedly that all slaves will follow the same requirements before they are freed. There is nothing more to say on that topic.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus asks StoryHost Azrael, \\"Which brings me to another assist which was never answered, that of using OOC means to achieve IC goals.\\"\\r\\n08:19 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I think he deliberately mislead staff (or tried) to get his ooc wish\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus assumes, \\"But that's another thing we can't talk about, because it doesn't concern me.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"We're not discussing other assists. It's past time I should have left already. We're here to discuss this specific problem.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael asks Sir Althalus, \\"So, do you understand what is required to get the promotion to Lia? Both IC and OOC?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael asks Ryan, \\"Shall I send you back into the game? I don't think you're needed her anymore - thanks for your time.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"Supposedly.\\"\\r\\n08:20 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"What unanswered assist is he talking about?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael asks Sir Althalus, \\"Supposedly? Do you think you understand, or do you feel confused about what is needed?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Supposedly?\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"Well I've thought I've understood the last few times as well.\\"\\r\\n08:21 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"God, who knows. He probably complained about another player and wanted to know that we punish them or something\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael quotes, \\"You must get two higher ranking Doloreaux members - that is, two doloreaux members other than Althalus, who are gentry ranked or above - and they must write and sign a scroll that says \\"I give my support towards having Lia freed\\" - then you must send those scrolls to Sirazad. The scrolls must not indicate that they have reservations towards Lia being freed. You must also get the same sent from a representative of the slavers. That could be an active slaver, or it could be Ryan who does much of the slavers administration.\\"\\r\\n08:21 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"I assume he refers to the whole Caliste using ooc dislike of an owner to get what she wants ic which in his eyes is being rude to Al and getting away with it...but I have never seen the assist\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael asks, \\"Do you understand those instructions? Or should I clarify?\\"\\r\\n08:22 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"He's seriously losing some friends here, with the way he's carrying on\\"\\r\\n08:22 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I am assisting: Lia uses ooc pressure to get IG goals. Can we include that please :D\\"\\r\\n08:22 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"OOC pressuring Loki to get Lia freed, you mean?\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus shrugs, \\"That's fine.\\"\\r\\n08:23 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"OK, anything else we need to discuss?\\"\\r\\n08:23 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"Actually there are other assists about Lia regardsing the spider itch plot, where she told people @ooc 'I amjust a slave, but I am crucial to this plot, so you should behave differently with me IG\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods, \\"Thank you.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha adds, \\"Active slavers are I think Flynn, Minerva and Faile, anyone I missed?\\"\\r\\n08:23 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"if you want to address the pirate -theressa freeing issue.\\"\\r\\n08:23 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"How was she crucial to the plot? Gah! I seriously hope she does stop playing\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"Ryan.\\"\\r\\n08:24 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"It is up to you. I don't mind. However I don't want him trying to lie to me again.\\"\\r\\n08:24 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"she is threatening to stop?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael notes, \\"This is not something unusual, or specific to Lia. It is something that all previous slaves (other than Meepers, but that was a different situation...) have already done before they were freed. It is something Caliste will have to do before she is freed.\\"\\r\\n08:24 [LocalGame\|Morana] \\"Yep, she posted she was taking an indefinite break and might not return\\"\\r\\n08:24 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I am tempted to clarify that no ooc chatter should be included in her freeing.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael asks Sir Althalus, \\"Is there any remaining confusion on this topic, or anything else you would like to clarify, or would like us to clarify?\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha asks Sir Althalus, \\"Why did you tell Sirazad you had slaver support when you did not?\\"\\r\\n08:25 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I also think we should ask the other person if there was ooc chatter. I don't want them oocly bullied into this\\"\\r\\n08:25 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"lets hope they know to assist if they feel ooc bullied\\"\\r\\n08:25 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"They probably won't\\"\\r\\n08:25 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"We can let them know that they have support from the guides if they want to assist, though\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus tells StoryGuide Tasha, \\"Because I was talking to you or Az (can't remember who) and asked what sort of thing I was supposed to do considering that I wasn't actually freeing her yet, and was told to start the paperwork. Which Ryan was doing (or said he was doing at least)\\"\\r\\nRyan asks, \\"Did you want me to post the conversation between al and ry here? Then you guys can see if I inadvertantly made it sound like Ryan was suporting lia being freed.\\"\\r\\n08:26 [LocalGame\|Cade] \\"A forum post about how using OOC coercion to achieve IG goals is not appropriate and should be @assist'd about?\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha asks Sir Althalus openly, \\"And you thought that was the same as support for her being freed?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael reminds Sir Althalus, \\"When you spoke with me about how to go about getting Lia freed, I actually said that you should keep Althalus out of it, and get someone else to try to arrange it, and try to get the support. So... you probably don't want to make the argument that you're following advice I gave you about how to handle this.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I have been dealing with the prmotinos. I told you to address it with Az if you feel my decision is out of order. You did. He told you it is how it is and sent you back to me. Thus you should have clarified it with me as the one running the promotions. And you know that. I repeated often enough what you need.\\"\\r\\n08:27 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"Man....remind me again why I sold Lia to Althalus. And then kill me for doing it\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael taps his head, \\"Ah, I recall what I said about paperwork.\\"\\r\\n08:28 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I so tempted to point out he was trying to actively find other staff to not have to obey my decision (which again, was staff decision, not only mine, but he doesn't know that)\\"\\r\\n08:28 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"And I dislike that too. Going from staff to staff until he gets what he wants\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"I believe you asked why you need to do any RP at all for one token, since Lia isn't being freed. And I said it could represent starting paperwork to get her freed, starting the process of putting it through the courts, creating a paper trail of her good behavior, so that when it comes before a magistrate there's a lot of evidence of Lia deserving to be freed. That was your IC explanation for the OOC mechanic, not instructions on what to do.\\"\\r\\nRyan asks, \\"Did you want me to post the conversation between al and ry here? Then you guys can see if I inadvertantly made it sound like Ryan was suporting lia being freed. It's only a few lines.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha nods to Ryan, \\"I am interested.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Ryan, \\"It would help clear issues.\\"\\r\\n08:30 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"Uh, you know if Ryan posts it, we're probably going to have to ban him for lying to staff, if it's clear from the log that Ryan didn't support it\\"\\r\\nRyan nods, \\"Here goes....it will take a few lines.\\"\\r\\nRyan quotes, \\"Sir Althalus tells you simply, \\"My embassy have elected to begin the process of freeing our slave, Lia. While we do not intend to have her freed just yet, we have allocated a significant amount of funds, I imagine about a half of what she is worth, in order to do so.\\"\\r\\n08:31 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"But maybe that's necessary...\\"\\r\\nRyan quotes, \\"You consider Sir Althalus' words pointlessly.\\"\\r\\nRyan quotes, \\"You say anyway, \\"Yessir.\\"\\r\\nRyan quotes, \\"Sir Althalus asks you, \\"Are you still administrating the guild?\\"\\r\\nRyan quotes, \\"You nod.\\"\\r\\nRyan quotes, \\"Sir Althalus tells you, \\"Can you start sorting out any paperwork that needs sorting out, and figure out an exact price that we would have to pay when and if we decide to free her?\\"\\r\\nRyan quotes, \\"You nod, \\"Yessir.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"That was the entire conversation.\\"\\r\\n08:34 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"That was simply: what are your terms. I'll list them. Ok. That wasn't: I want Lia freed at all.\\"\\r\\n08:34 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"I'm too tired to be sure, but I can't see how that is giving your support, its just saying yepp, I'll do the paperwork I have to do in preparation, I suppose one could say why would you prepare paperwork if you intend to say no, but it is a leap of logic\\"\\r\\n08:34 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"Nope.\\"\\r\\n08:35 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"He said 'If and when' they decided to free her. They haven't even decided to do it yet, why would ryan assume he was giving permission?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods, \\"Yeah... that doesn't even remotely look like support from Ryan. Just that he's not being outright rude to a noble, and agreeing to come up with a price if Lia is going to be freed.\\"\\r\\n08:35 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I still think he is delibeartely wishes to mislead people OOCly. IG is fine, but oocly is not fine.\\"\\r\\n08:36 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"And I admit, I did allow myself to be biased with him, so I lack my usual understanding\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael notes, \\"Althalus even says \\"if and when we decide to free her\\" - there was nothing in there asking about Ryan's opinion or support for freeing her.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha quotes, \\"If and when Al decides he wants to free her, he hasn't even decided that at this point.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus tells StoryHost Azrael, \\"Which is pretty much the same as Otto's letter (without the rank difference), which was what I thought was necessary.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha grins at StoryHost Azrael, \\"Snap.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"That isn't support. That's just agreeing not to stop you.\\"\\r\\nYou reveal, \\"While I do not see the reason in bothering to promote her, I also see no reason as to why I should halt your intentions in doing so. Rather than support the slave, I rather support your descisions.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"This isn't support.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods to Sir Althalus, \\"Yes, it's pretty much the same as Otto's letter. Both saying \\"Sure, we won't stop you\\" but none saying that they support freeing the slave. Which is, obviously, what was required.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It clearly says. I am not supporting it. I think it is not ok, but I don't oppose you as lead, because you are lead.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus disagrees with StoryHost Azrael, \\"Not obviously. If it was obvious what was required, I would have got that. Why do you think I've been talking to you OOC trying to figure this out?\\"\\r\\n08:38 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"Maybe he's just not political enough to understand what we mean when we say 'support'.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods to Sir Althalus, \\"Well, it's not been clarified what is needed. And you understand what is needed. So how about we send you and ryan back into the game, and let you get the written support you need?\\"\\r\\n08:39 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"He is\\"\\r\\n08:39 [LocalGame\|Cade] \\"He already misunderstood 'support' once with Aeryn and Avo promotion tokens. I don't think he'd forget again.\\"\\r\\n08:40 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"Exactly\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"Ignoring the Caliste thing, the major thing that could have avoided this whole thing was the information as to why the Doloreaux need the slaver support, which you've explained now.\\"\\r\\n08:40 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I would like a warning issued officially for his behavrio\\"\\r\\n08:40 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I think it is highly due\\"\\r\\n08:40 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"personally I can't wait until Lia is freed and she is no longer the slaver's problem and I bet she will find it so dull being free anyway, this is all so silly and pointless!\\"\\r\\n08:40 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"And that log showed him intentionally misrepresenting the situation too. It was \\"and if there is an extra token, I'll take that\\" when discussing who should get tokens. When he knew there was an extra token. Then he told Spot \\"they support Aeryn getting promoted\\"\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"Why didn't you ask, if you didn't know why?\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"You knew you needed it.\\"\\r\\n08:41 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"The line is: warning, suspension, ban. I ask for warning now\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"No. The major thing that could have avoided this situation would have been you following the OOC instructions that you were given. And asking if you needed an IC explanation about the Doloreaux support.\\"\\r\\n08:41 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"She won't find it dull, because she already isn't acting like a slave in any way, and has no interaction with any slaves or slavers. She will do exactly what she does now\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"It would also have helped if you had been clear with Sirazad when talking to her, and not said things like \\"I have the support from a slaver that you asked for\\" when you clearly don't. And when it was asked for in writing. Just today she received a box with the Doloreaux scrolls but no slavers scroll, and writing on the box again asking her to process it.\\"\\r\\n08:42 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"I assume you issue the warnings Az, but I agree, he needs at least that for this, it is obvious to me he was just trying to get what he wanted without having to kiss butt to Ryan to get it, I say guilty as charged\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus tells StoryHost Azrael, \\"That's unfair, I have been -trying- to do that. I've been asking you what I needed to do with the slavers, and this is the first time I've understood it.\\"\\r\\n08:42 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"Actually I think a suspension is due too, but I certainly think warning is due. .\\"\\r\\n08:43 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"He lied, mislead, forumhopped with staff, wanted to play us out against each other. He knew what he is doing.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"I'm putting a note saying that you've been given a warning about this, since it's a very similar situation to when you told us that Aeryn had support for her promotion, when the players told us they hadn't given support when asked. Considering that situation, I'd think you'd have been more careful about this one.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus adds, \\"And I asked if there was anything else, and I assumed that she'd take all possible effort to investigate it in case there was some way to stop it.\\"\\r\\n08:44 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"And he'll whinge to Lia, and they'll decide we're all unfair and horrible and he'll stop being our friend and hopefully she'll stop playing\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael assures Sir Althalus, \\"Staff aren't gleefully looking for every possible way to block Lia getting freed.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus rolls his beady yellow eyes, \\"Why don't you take it on board and consider that maybe it's not entirely -my- fault, that maybe your countless rules and regulations aren't always clear, or understood?\\"\\r\\nRyan wonders, \\"Why would we invesitage to stop it?\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus gestures at a field dominated by a carousel, \\"Why are you asking me that when here we are, investigating it?\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"Seriously....why would Sirazad waste her time investigating ways to thwart you and Lia?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods to Sir Althalus, \\"Perhaps we're not clear. Hopefully you now know exactly what is required.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"We're not investigating ways to stop Lia being freed. We're investigating why you didn't do what you were told you needed to do to free her.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"That's my understanding of it, anyway.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus rolls his beady yellow eyes, \\"Yes, because you're clearly here as a player, not staff.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha tells Sir Althalus, \\"Because we felt concerned that you were trying to be deceptive to get your own way, by telling Sirazad you had slaver support when you did not.\\"\\r\\nYou mention, \\"I am. That is why I don't say many things.\\"\\r\\n08:47 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"We're so onto you Sira. You spend all your time trying to thwart Lia, don't you? Admit it. *eyeroll*\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"We're resolving the problem, where you were getting frustrated saying that you've done what is required to have Lia freed, while Sirazad thinks you haven't. I think we've now established what is needed, in clear terms - and what Althalus still has to do.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael asks, \\"Shall we end this conversation now?\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Lilandra's scroll suffices. One down from the 3 scrolls I need. 2 more to go.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"And I'm being given a warning for another misunderstanding... but are staff going to make any effort to prevent things like this happening, or just putting the blame entirely on me?\\"\\r\\n08:48 [LocalGame\|Cade] \\"Is that what he said? :D\\"\\r\\n08:48 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"Yup\\"\\r\\n08:48 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"Basically. He kind of blames it on me\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus asks, \\"Like just paging me and saying \\"What support do you have, we're concerned you don't have what we require.\\"\\r\\n08:49 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"Sir Althalus adds, \\"And I asked if there was anything else, and I assumed that she'd take all possible effort to investigate it in case there was some way to stop it.\\"\\"\\r\\n08:49 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"She being Sira\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus supposes, \\"Or actually having some sort of file that has all these little rules and particulars laid out clearly, so that players have something to reference when they're trying to achieve something?\\"\\r\\n08:50 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"He is being ridiculous, considering how much effort I actually put in making it possible for him to get what he wants if he goes via IG routes.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"The warning means that we know this is a problem, so next time we can make sure we are clear. And so you know that it's a problem as well, and next time you can ask for clarification, or be careful when telling staff. For example, next time you could tell sirazad \\"Ryan says he'll start the paperwork\\" rather than \\"a slaver gives their support\\" and Sirazad could tell you if that's enough or not. So we hopefully avoid this situation in the future.\\"\\r\\n08:50 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"He has Lia in his ear like a little devil\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha reminds Sir Althalus, \\"If you are ever not sure what staff mean, if it is not clear, then seek clarification. That is your responsibility. We are not able, well, I am not able to explain every thing I say in minute detail in case someone misunderstands me, like a lawyer.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"You are very welcome to write a file about all the little rules of the game, if you like. We would like to write them out, too - manpower is always an issue.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus tells StoryGuide Tasha, \\"I've been trying to clarify with Az for the last week or two, and I thought I understood.\\"\\r\\nYou mention, \\"I have paged you each time. Each time I listed what I need. Anyway. I wish this not to be a returning issue. I hope all what is needed is settled now and I am waiting for the scrolls. In the moment I have the scrolls, I'll give the promotion. Not a second later.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"... and, I think everyone has had their say. So I'm going to end this discussion. If anyone has any further problems or concerns, please @assist, page me, or email me. If anyone is concerned with how I handled the situation, please email customer experience at CE@skotos.net.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha smiles at Sir Althalus, \\"Great, well, we will all keep trying then.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha nods to StoryHost Azrael, \\"cool.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael waves, \\"OK, I'm off. Have a good evening everyone.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"Good luck with getting the scrolls.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha asks StoryHost Azrael, \\"You putting Al's body back?\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus waves.\\r\\nRyan limps out.\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha waves to Sir Althalus.\\r\\nSir Althalus assuredly trots out.\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha leaves." \}), (\{ "balkaar", 1265553536, "balkaar has issued a warning to loki_ms for this behavior." \}), (\{ "balkaar", 1265553539, "LOG OF THE CONVERSATION\\r\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is a field. A musical carousel dominates the area. There is an exit to the north.\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael, Ryan, you, Sir Althalus and StoryGuide Tasha are standing near here.\\r\\nSir Althalus waves.\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael waves, \\"OK.\\"\\r\\nRyan waves.\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha waves, \\"Hi.\\"\\r\\nYou wave, \\"Hi.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus and you, \\"So, from what I understand, there's confusion as to what's going on. I hear that Althalus feels he's done everything needed to get the promotion token awarded to Lia, but Sirazad feels that it hasn't been done yet. Is that about right?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael apologizes, \\"It's my bedtime, so I'm trying to get through this fast. I apologize if I come off sounding grumpy or sharp - it's not intended, I'm just rushed.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus nods.\\r\\nYou nod, \\"I feel the instructions were clear cut and they are purposefully squirmed about and misinterpreted as if I would change the terms. while it never changed.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael taps his head sleepily.\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"me too, trung to be in bed by midnight.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha means, \\"trying.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"So, from my understanding, the requirements for Lia to be freed was that two ranking members of the Avoirdupois must write a scroll to Sirazad stating that they support Lia being freed. And that one member of the slaver's guild must write a scroll to Sirazad stating that they support Lia being freed. Correct?\\"\\r\\nYou confess, \\"If the same energy dedicated to argue the decision would have put into obtaning things IG we would have long be done with it.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus asks you, \\"What am I squirming out of? You asked for support of slavers and two high ranked Dolo. Then it turned into written support of Dolo high-ups and slaver support.\\"\\r\\nYou recite from StoryPlotter Sirazad's scroll...\\r\\nYou start, \\"The scroll is addressed to Althalus.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It recites as follows...\\"\\r\\nYou recite, Herr Auriville,\\r\\nThe guard does well, unfortunately I have little chance to meet them,h owever I have made another new recruit, a bear known as Mac, I believe he is of admirable character and should do well in our House.\\r\\nIn regards to the slave I am ambivilant. While I do not see the reason in bothering to promote her, I also see no reason as to why I should halt your intentions in doing so. Rather than support the slave, I rather support your descisions.\\r\\nThis week I may have some free time, the week after I am afraid I have some duties that I must perform that will keep me occupied. The week after I shall once again be at your disposal.\\r\\nYou conclude, \\"It is unsigned.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"Ryan never supported Lia getting freed.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus tells Ryan, \\"he did say he would do the work, though, when al asked.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I have one of Lilandra. That is ok. This is not ok. This is not support. This is not someone puting down the name of their own of wanting to free the slave. This is someone saying: i don't see why we are doing this.\\"\\r\\nYou repeat, \\"I want written notes saying: I want her promoted.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I have one scroll that says so.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I want two more.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods to Sir Althalus, \\"He did say he would do the work. He didn't say he would support it. That is why Sirazad is asking for written support - so it is very clear if they want to put their name behind a request asking for her to be freed.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"A slaver, and a high ranked dolo.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"It's the difference between signing a petition, and saying \\"Sure, if they allow it, I'll go along with that. But I'm not signing.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus tells StoryHost Azrael, \\"You said I just needed him to support Al, not that he needed to support the slave.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"So what we've got is one scroll stating support. One scroll stating a lack of support, but also a lack of objection, and a third PC that you OOC told Sirazad supports Lia being freed, who doesn't support Lia being freed.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha grins at Sir Althalus, \\"Saying you will do your job if you need to is pretty different from saying you support something, wouldn't you say?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"He needs to support Althalus freeing the slave. I don't care if he says \\"I hate her guts, but Al wants it, so I'm supporting her getting the promotion.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"But he needs to make clear that he supports the action of freeing Lia. Not \\"I don't see a reason for it\\" but \\"I want to see her freed\\" - very big difference between those two statements.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus rolls his beady yellow eyes annoyedly, \\"Well fuck you guys need to be more explicit if you're going to be this bloody pedantic.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Sir Althalus, \\"I was clear in my pages. SUPPORT THE FREEING OF THE SLAVE. I do not know how you make him do that. If he supports you enough, he will write a scroll with that content. Why he writes it? I don't mind. He can do it to get lands himself, to have a slave lover, to avoid cutting his toes...\\"\\r\\nYou perk your ears merely.\\r\\nRyan eyes Sir Althalus.\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha reminds Sir Althalus gently, \\"Dude, you are not being very nice to us, and you need to remember we are volunteers and you just shouldn't speak to us like this. It is not nice.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"Well I'm feeling pissed off and ganged up on.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha tells Sir Althalus, \\"I know you are grumpy coz you feel frustrated, but you do yourself no favours with your sucky attitude.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"We're not here to gang up. We're here to resolve the OOC problem.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus tells StoryGuide Tasha, \\"I don't play this game to suck up to people who I think are my friends.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha grins at Sir Althalus, \\"Good, coz if you were it is not working.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha tells Sir Althalus, \\"We are not asking you to suck up to us.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"we are asking to be treated decently.\\"\\r\\nYou point out, \\"I am not here as staff. They are. They are mediating between you and I. So I am in the same position as you presently.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael mildly reminds Sir Althalus, \\"Nobody is asking you to suck up to anyone. But while we're here speaking as staff representing a company, speaking to a paying player, - we need to represent the paying company. If you have a problem with the way things are handled - OOC friendship or not - I recommend you take it up with CE@skotos.net - which is the standard escalation process.\\"\\r\\nYou point at Ryan, \\"He is here to help with the issue, so Azrael and Tasha are the guides.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"I'm asking to be treated fairly. Well, for someone else to be treated fairly.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"we are happy to treat everyone fairly.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"Everyone is being treated fairly, from what I see.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha asks Sir Althalus curiously, \\"What in the world do you think we seek to gain by not treating Lia fairly? I assume you mean Lia?\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"Part of what you need is Ryan's support to free Lia, which Althalus doesn't have.\\"\\r\\nYou agree, \\"We treat everyone similary. Other players were asked to do the same. Exactly the same. You too. You can go to other slavers too and get their support.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"Then how is Flynn and Ryan selling Caliste back to the Avo because they think they are going to free her against the slavers will ICly fair compared to the hoops I have to jump through to give a single promotion token?\\"\\r\\nYou ask Sir Althalus, \\"Does Caliste have any promotion made?\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"She isn't free. They will have to go through the same to get freed, I imagine.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"If not then I don't see how it compares.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"If she is asked to be spent a token on, she'l have to obtain permit of the slavers too.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus tells you, \\"Well it sounds like ICly I have to get \\"support\\" but the Avo can just tell the slavers \\"We're freeing her, deal with it.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael reminds Sir Althalus, \\"We've already spoken about Caliste. I've already told you that, to free Caliste, they will have to do the exact same actions as you are doing. I've already reassured you that any rules about freeing slaves - although they may change over time - are always applied to *all* slave PCs equally.\\"\\r\\nRyan tells Sir Althalus, \\"What happened with Caliste was IC. There was IC reason behind it.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"Even if you don't know all the details.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Sir Althalus, \\"If they manage to get the permit IG, that is IG. You have to get the permit IG too. The same permit. How you do it IG, is IG and up to your RP. however not up to ooc complaining that permit is unnecessary.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"And a BIG ooc one.\\"\\r\\nYou ask Sir Althalus, \\"So your issue is what happens with Caliste instead of what happens with Lia?\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus snorts, \\"I have all sorts of issues at the moment.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods, \\"So, in this specific case.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"1) Do you feel that the requirements for getting a promotion token given to Lia are clear?\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"Npo.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"No.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"OK. Let me explain what the requirements are.\\"\\r\\n08:02 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"What a douche, seriously\\"\\r\\n08:03 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"wow, he is so hurtful when he doesn't get what he wants, you reckon he would be the same or meaner if we were not his RL friends?\\"\\r\\n08:04 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"He is throwing a tantrum. Lia has been pointing fingers and poisining his perceptive. She is jealous over Caliste. She is pissed staff said, that it is unreasonable and OOC Lia is favored by the Avo and Caliste is ignored. So she hurts him in return.\\"\\r\\n08:04 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I am amused though. Just now, I stated exactly, spelled out word by word what is needed.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"You must get two higher ranking Doloreaux members - that is, two doloreaux members other than Althalus, who are gentry ranked or above - and they must write and sign a scroll that says \\"I give my support towards having Lia freed\\" - then you must send those scrolls to Sirazad. The scrolls must not indicate that they have reservations towards Lia being freed. You must also get the same sent from a representative of the slavers. That could be an active slaver, or it could be Ryan who does much of the slavers administration.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael asks, \\"Are those instructions clear, or should I clarify?\\"\\r\\n08:05 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"He'd be the same if we weren't RL friends, yes\\"\\r\\n08:05 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"But only after he feels he \\"knows\\" us\\"\\r\\n08:05 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"What a great friend\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus asks StoryHost Azrael, \\"Are these IC scrolls? And if so, who are they being sent to IC?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"They are IC scrolls, and you can roleplay that they are being sent back to Bruges, as a request for the NPC Doloreaux nobility to put pressure on the NPC Rinaldi nobility to get this slave freed.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"And if we're freeing a slave via putting pressure on the Rinaldi, what is the point of the scrolls from the slavers?\\"\\r\\n08:07 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"He knows what is needed. He just wants to argue that he didn't, because he knew he didn't have what he needed and was trying to bully Sirazad into doing it anyway\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Uhm... Lady Greta. Or Lord Henrik. They are people back home who deal with house matters. Burges. You can send them to the clerk of house archives too.\\"\\r\\n08:07 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I totally know he was trying to bully me.\\"\\r\\n08:07 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"That is why I am angry\\"\\r\\n08:07 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"He seems most pissed that he needs ryan's permission\\"\\r\\n08:08 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"He can get Faile's or Flynns or get someone hired by them etc.\\"\\r\\n08:08 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"He is pissed there is someone he can not OOCly force\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"I thought the promotion tokens were the incentive for the slavers to release a slave. I mean, just judging by what Dolo promotions have gone for on the AH, that's an amount around 150 thousand denari.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"Because the Doloreaux nobles won't want to go to the cost and risk of pressuring the Rinaldi, and then finding the slavers are unwilling to sell the slave or allow it to be freed. Slaves are, after all, property. And the Doloreaux don't have the right to walk into Triskellian and legally take someone's property.\\"\\r\\n08:09 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"coz he thinks that Ryan will be the hardest to get, whereas he can push the house members about more easily as a whole as he has something to offer them\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"You are welcome to offer promotion tokens to the slavers, to entice them into supporting Lia being freed. Or whatever other in-game actions you can think of.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus tells StoryHost Azrael, \\"Which doesn't make sense ICly, because of the Ryan and Flynn thing.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"What ryan and flynn thing?\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus snorts, \\"Come off it. Yay, lets increase the price of freeing a slave even more than it's ridiculous amount.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"Only if you can't think of anything else to covince them.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"It was a big deal freeing a slave, it hardly ever happened.\\"\\r\\n08:10 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"Yeah, he has no OOC power over ryan\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus tells StoryGuide Tasha, \\"Which is WHY it's three freaking promotion tokens!\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"150 thousand denari!\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha means, \\"historically, I mean it took generation after generation, not a few months.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Sir Althalus, \\"All slaves, when become slaves are clearly told, the price isn't a kiss on the feet. They know, what they agree to. We ask them thrice if they understand and accept.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods, \\"We specifically warn them that it is unlikely that they will ever be IG freed.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"Anyway, the cost isn't really part of this discussion. You know what is required. The cost is just the in-game cost.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus tells StoryHost Azrael, \\"of course it's part of the discussion, it's all related.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"I don't see how whether Althalus needs to bribe people or whether he used his powers of pursuasion, or holds something over them to get them to agree to what he wants is really part of this discussion.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods, \\"It's related, in that it's the IC cost. And has been for years. But this is a discussion about the OOC problems. When things are resolved, you're welcome to talk to the plotters, if you need help with the IC aspects.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha asks Sir Althalus again, \\"What is the Ryan and Flynn thing?\\"\\r\\nYou disagree, \\"It is not related. The cost has been the same since I play the game. It always was. You never minded it. It is fair, as it is applied to all in the same manner. It is universal and unbiased. Lowering it for Lia... now how would that be fair?\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"The cost is the same, the hoops have changed.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"How would you know? How many slaves have you freed?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael states, \\"This is a game of politics. You need to perform political actions to achieve your objective. The hoops will continue to change for various activities as we build the game of politics.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"However, the hoops are the same for everyone.\\"\\r\\nYou mention to StoryHost Azrael, \\"There wasn't really a change actually. All the slaves that were freed were done so the same way. So yes, the same is requested as was with other slaves.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael notes also, \\"And the hoops really haven't changed. We have required support from other house members before promotions are given for years. The only difference in this case is, when promoting a slave, it also requires permission from the slavers. When Rocher was freed, the slavers were approached and gave permission before it happened.\\"\\r\\n08:15 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"Lianaar was asked about Rocher and agreed. The house of the Avoirdupois stood behind Rocher fully. There was no other slave freeing since I am IG.\\"\\r\\n08:16 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"He's just whinging because he has Lia complaining in his ear, and she's practically his girlfriend\\"\\r\\nYou add, \\"The other times slavers had their say too. They were asked to give their vote.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus repeats, \\"And the Ryan and Flynn thing is that one one hand, I've got you people telling me I need slavers support, because the Doloreaux won't put pressure on the Rinaldi to free her, but ICly, Ryan and Flynn sold Caliste back to the Avo ICly because they couldn't stop her from being freed if the Avo wanted her freed.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"You are being asked for specific written support from the members - but that's not unsurprising.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"Actually, Ryan had other IC motivation, that you are clearly unaware of.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael points at Ryan, \\"You've told Sirazad a few times that you have the support of the slavers, but yet the PC in question tells us that he doesn't support it. So we need written support to make sure there are no confusions or misunderstandings.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus snorts, \\"IC or OOC? What happened to \\"Caliste doesn't want to be owned by any of the houses.\\"\\r\\n08:17 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"She really is, isn't she. It is so messed up.\\"\\r\\nRyan tells Sir Althalus, \\"OOC she didn't mind being owned by them. IC Ryan had a reason to do sell her to them.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"I was told that OOCly.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"The OOC rules still apply. If Caliste's player tells us she doesn't want to be owned by a specific master or guild, then she won't be. And, as we have told you MANY times, for Caliste to be freed, the same permission and support will need to be IC given as for Lia.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha tells Sir Althalus again, \\"Who owns a slave is a very sensitive ooc matter and we work hard to make sure ooc the players are happy with who they are with. The leader of the Avo house changed, dude.\\"\\r\\n08:19 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I still feel he lied to me deliberately. The package didn't include slaver support at all.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael also says, \\"And I really don't want to discuss Caliste any more. We've stated repeatedly that all slaves will follow the same requirements before they are freed. There is nothing more to say on that topic.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus asks StoryHost Azrael, \\"Which brings me to another assist which was never answered, that of using OOC means to achieve IC goals.\\"\\r\\n08:19 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I think he deliberately mislead staff (or tried) to get his ooc wish\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus assumes, \\"But that's another thing we can't talk about, because it doesn't concern me.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"We're not discussing other assists. It's past time I should have left already. We're here to discuss this specific problem.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael asks Sir Althalus, \\"So, do you understand what is required to get the promotion to Lia? Both IC and OOC?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael asks Ryan, \\"Shall I send you back into the game? I don't think you're needed her anymore - thanks for your time.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"Supposedly.\\"\\r\\n08:20 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"What unanswered assist is he talking about?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael asks Sir Althalus, \\"Supposedly? Do you think you understand, or do you feel confused about what is needed?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Supposedly?\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"Well I've thought I've understood the last few times as well.\\"\\r\\n08:21 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"God, who knows. He probably complained about another player and wanted to know that we punish them or something\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael quotes, \\"You must get two higher ranking Doloreaux members - that is, two doloreaux members other than Althalus, who are gentry ranked or above - and they must write and sign a scroll that says \\"I give my support towards having Lia freed\\" - then you must send those scrolls to Sirazad. The scrolls must not indicate that they have reservations towards Lia being freed. You must also get the same sent from a representative of the slavers. That could be an active slaver, or it could be Ryan who does much of the slavers administration.\\"\\r\\n08:21 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"I assume he refers to the whole Caliste using ooc dislike of an owner to get what she wants ic which in his eyes is being rude to Al and getting away with it...but I have never seen the assist\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael asks, \\"Do you understand those instructions?

I told you to address it with Az if you feel my decision is out of order. You did. He told you it is how it is and sent you back to me. Thus you should have clarified it with me as the one running the promotions. And you know that. I repeated often enough what you need.\\"\\r\\n08:27 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"Man....remind me again why I sold Lia to Althalus. And then kill me for doing it\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael taps his head, \\"Ah, I recall what I said about paperwork.\\"\\r\\n08:28 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I so tempted to point out he was trying to actively find other staff to not have to obey my decision (which again, was staff decision, not only mine, but he doesn't know that)\\"\\r\\n08:28 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"And I dislike that too. Going from staff to staff until he gets what he wants\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"I believe you asked why you need to do any RP at all for one token, since Lia isn't being freed. And I said it could represent starting paperwork to get her freed, starting the process of putting it through the courts, creating a paper trail of her good behavior, so that when it comes before a magistrate there's a lot of evidence of Lia deserving to be freed. That was your IC explanation for the OOC mechanic, not instructions on what to do.\\"\\r\\nRyan asks, \\"Did you want me to post the conversation between al and ry here?

Rather than support the slave, I rather support your descisions.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"This isn't support.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods to Sir Althalus, \\"Yes, it's pretty much the same as Otto's letter. Both saying \\"Sure, we won't stop you\\" but none saying that they support freeing the slave. Which is, obviously, what was required.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It clearly says. I am not supporting it. I think it is not ok, but I don't oppose you as lead, because you are lead.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus disagrees with StoryHost Azrael, \\"Not obviously. If it was obvious what was required, I would have got that. Why do you think I've been talking to you OOC trying to figure this out?\\"\\r\\n08:38 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"Maybe he's just not political enough to understand what we mean when we say 'support'.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods to Sir Althalus, \\"Well, it's not been clarified what is needed.

So how about we send you and ryan back into the game, and let you get the written support you need?\\"\\r\\n08:39 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"He is\\"\\r\\n08:39 [LocalGame\|Cade] \\"He already misunderstood 'support' once with Aeryn and Avo promotion tokens. I don't think he'd forget again.\\"\\r\\n08:40 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"Exactly\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"Ignoring the Caliste thing, the major thing that could have avoided this whole thing was the information as to why the Doloreaux need the slaver support, which you've explained now.\\"\\r\\n08:40 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I would like a warning issued officially for his behavrio\\"\\r\\n08:40 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I think it is highly due\\"\\r\\n08:40 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"personally I can't wait until Lia is freed and she is no longer the slaver's problem and I bet she will find it so dull being free anyway, this is all so silly and pointless!\\"\\r\\n08:40 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"And that log showed him intentionally misrepresenting the situation too. It was \\"and if there is an extra token, I'll take that\\" when discussing who should get tokens. When he knew there was an extra token.

I ask for warning now\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Sir Althalus, \\"No. The major thing that could have avoided this situation would have been you following the OOC instructions that you were given. And asking if you needed an IC explanation about the Doloreaux support.\\"\\r\\n08:41 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"She won't find it dull, because she already isn't acting like a slave in any way, and has no interaction with any slaves or slavers. She will do exactly what she does now\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"It would also have helped if you had been clear with Sirazad when talking to her, and not said things like \\"I have the support from a slaver that you asked for\\" when you clearly don't. And when it was asked for in writing. Just today she received a box with the Doloreaux scrolls but no slavers scroll, and writing on the box again asking her to process it.\\"\\r\\n08:42 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"I assume you issue the warnings Az, but I agree, he needs at least that for this, it is obvious to me he was just trying to get what he wanted without having to kiss butt to Ryan to get it, I say guilty as charged\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus tells StoryHost Azrael, \\"That's unfair, I have been -trying- to do that. I've been asking you what I needed to do with the slavers, and this is the first time I've understood it.\\"\\r\\n08:42 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"Actually I think a suspension is due too, but I certainly think warning is due. .\\"\\r\\n08:43 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"He lied, mislead, forumhopped with staff, wanted to play us out against each other.

Considering that situation, I'd think you'd have been more careful about this one.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus adds, \\"And I asked if there was anything else, and I assumed that she'd take all possible effort to investigate it in case there was some way to stop it.\\"\\r\\n08:44 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"And he'll whinge to Lia, and they'll decide we're all unfair and horrible and he'll stop being our friend and hopefully she'll stop playing\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael assures Sir Althalus, \\"Staff aren't gleefully looking for every possible way to block Lia getting freed.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus rolls his beady yellow eyes, \\"Why don't you take it on board and consider that maybe it's not entirely -my- fault, that maybe your countless rules and regulations aren't always clear, or understood?\\"\\r\\nRyan wonders, \\"Why would we invesitage to stop it?\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus gestures at a field dominated by a carousel, \\"Why are you asking me that when here we are, investigating it?\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"Seriously....why would Sirazad waste her time investigating ways to thwart you and Lia?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods to Sir Althalus, \\"Perhaps we're not clear. Hopefully you now know exactly what is required.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"We're not investigating ways to stop Lia being freed. We're investigating why you didn't do what you were told you needed to do to free her.\\"\\r\\nRyan says, \\"That's my understanding of it, anyway.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus rolls his beady yellow eyes, \\"Yes, because you're clearly here as a player, not staff.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha tells Sir Althalus, \\"Because we felt concerned that you were trying to be deceptive to get your own way, by telling Sirazad you had slaver support when you did not.\\"\\r\\nYou mention, \\"I am.

Admit it. *eyeroll*\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"We're resolving the problem, where you were getting frustrated saying that you've done what is required to have Lia freed, while Sirazad thinks you haven't. I think we've now established what is needed, in clear terms - and what Althalus still has to do.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael asks, \\"Shall we end this conversation now?\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Lilandra's scroll suffices. One down from the 3 scrolls I need. 2 more to go.\\"\\r\\nSir Althalus says, \\"And I'm being given a warning for another misunderstanding... but are staff going to make any effort to prevent things like this happening, or just putting the blame entirely on me?\\"\\r\\n08:48 [LocalGame\|Cade] \\"Is that what he said? :D\\"\\r\\n08:48 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"Yup\\"\\r\\n08:48 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"Basically.

And so you know that it's a problem as well, and next time you can ask for clarification, or be careful when telling staff. For example, next time you could tell sirazad \\"Ryan says he'll start the paperwork\\" rather than \\"a slaver gives their support\\" and Sirazad could tell you if that's enough or not. So we hopefully avoid this situation in the future.\\"\\r\\n08:50 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"He has Lia in his ear like a little devil\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha reminds Sir Althalus, \\"If you are ever not sure what staff mean, if it is not clear, then seek clarification.

I don't do confrontation very well.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Lys teaching Fyros medic was apparently alt crossover because it was mentioned by Spot (who I've requested of Az before not to handle my guide issues) that she wouldn't train Kahiva. And Lys apparently hated Fyros.\\r\\n\\r\\n        No, Lys did not hate Fyros, nor has she ever hated him. She might have thought him strange, but ultimately she knows he has done a lot to donate to the infirmary, does a lot of healing and works closely with Hush. She did not teach him for free, but for a trade in skills. As for Kahiva, Lys had never met her before, nor knew of any good deeds she had done. Not only that, I did not seek out the RP with Fyros, I actually received a missive requesting lessons. So since Fyros had done a lot of good work Lys thought it was okay. It is not because I want to OOCly join all my characters together to team up against Clover, because that is what Ditto and Spot spoke to me about, which might make Spot a little biased.\\r\\n\\r\\n    Sunta teaching Fyros.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Again, I did not seek out the RP, I got a letter. He wanted to learn sniper, which - as far as I know - she is the only one IG who has mastered it. And I wrote IC to both Marcus and Xena to see if she were allowed to because he had been kicked from the House and may have brought disfavor on them by her teaching him. Both Xena and Marcus said it was okay. When asked OOCly by Ditto and Spot to withdraw I did and she no longer swaps lessons with Fyros, nor do I RP with Fyros via Sunny, Noe, Raz, or Una, or even Achlys usually.\\r\\n\\r\\n    RPing a lot with Fyros' characters.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Only Zaria hangs around Fyros' characters a lot, but that is largely part of her being my main character and meeting them ICly, not because I actively seek his characters all the time. It was not mentioned why this was wrong and not all of my alts do interact with him, but if the assumption is that I have an OOC fancy for him then whoever thought that up can think again. I have absolutely no interest in breaking up a happy marriage. Frankly, it is a little insulting to me that it would even be considered. It is obvious Fyros' player is completely in love with his wife, and I would not want to do anything to ruin it. Otherwise, if that assumption was not there then I am simply enjoying the RP of another player, and he is not the only player I RP with a lot. When Eiryk was around I would RP a lot with him, I also RP a lot with Virendra and Omen (when she is around). I know Spot suggested RPing with him and his characters once, but I actively try to avoid him (and Adrien's player, Kahiva included) because I want to avoid IC/OOC conflict, i.e. my vast dislike of both of them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for that last point, I was already kicked from staff and then I actively left the game for 2 months. So coming back to the game and getting this additional punishment over the first two points is a kick in the teeth when I've already been punished and when they have legitimate IC reasons. I also bring a lot to the game, and have helped staff with some building, and I don't want my presence to be taken advantage of.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you need to ask anything else feel free to do so.\\r\\n\\r\\n---------\\r\\n\\r\\nHer being kicked from staff was mainly due to inability to separate IC and OOC feelings, and this influenced both her playing and her staffing." \}) \}), ([  ]) \}) ]) ])

It has been detrimental to the game, I think to your enjoyment of the game, and to others enjoyment of the game. The entire fictional world is less fun when people do that. There will always be a moderate amount of OOC chat about what's going on, but you took it over the line. Instead I'm just putting you back on a single alt.\\"\\r\\nYou inquire, \\"Do you know which alt you want to keep?\\"\\r\\nLiala says, \\"This one.\\"\\r\\nYou nod acceptingly, \\"Okay. Do you want a day to send scrolls with your other PCs to say goodbyes?\\"\\r\\nLiala says, \\"Impossible.\\"\\r\\nYou inquire, \\"What do you mean?\\"\\r\\nLiala tells you, \\"Another thing. Revoke Temp's player's alts then, and crina's player, and abel's player's and lisa's player's and arthurr's players, everyone in fact, for ooc chatter and discussing things with friends oocly. And it's impossible because Tsu's in self-induced quarantine.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"If necessary, we may need to if people let their OOC influence their IC, or share IC info OOC in order to affect the behavior of other players. As I said, there will be some OOC chat. But passing on IC info to achieve OOC goals is cheating. Outright. If others are doing the same, we'll deal with that too.\\"\\r\\nYou add, \\"And if you want to have Tsu 'extend' his quarantine o leaving the city and sending a scroll off that might make sense. If you don't want to send scrolls out with them or say goodbyes that's fine too.\\"\\r\\nLiala tells you, \\"It's only cheating if you use it IC and we've never used it IC. At least I haven't. And there are things that if your making a plan, you have to do ooc before you do ic usually because of time zone, or ability to get on, difference. And even limiting everyone to one character STILL won't stop ooc chatter. The only way to stop that is to suspend everyone outfight.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Liala knowingly, \\"I am not aiming to stop all OOC chatter as it won't happen, and there are some constructive uses for it. You weren't using it constructively. You were passing on information. In one part it seemed to help with an OOC campaign against another player. I am unsure how else. And you're right. If it continues I'll escalate it to suspensions and then bans. What amazes me to be utterly honest, is how absolutely unable you and your friends are to how abusive you've been OOC.\\"\\r\\nLiala asks you, \\"If there's an item you want turned into a weapon do you have to pay stp's for it if it's not normally a weapon?\\"\\r\\nYou state, \\"You've cheated, and coordinated and shared info to 'win' against others. That's wrong. And you've in general convinced yourselves you're the victims when you've been the ones going OOC. So, now I hope you stop. If you don't again, the next step for me is suspension. Chat with people OOC, make friends. Stop trying to accomplish things IC by sharing info OOC.\\"\\r\\nYou inquire, \\"If you had pruning shears for example and wanted them to be a dagger?\\"\\r\\nLiala says, \\"A transplanting trowel actually.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Would cost StP.\\"\\r\\nYou admit, \\"I'm unsure how many. Perhaps as little as 100. Maybe less as an IC smith doing the work to sharpen it. I'm not a builder. The best thing is to @assist.\\"\\r\\nLiala nods.\\r\\nYou inquire, \\"Any questions before I return you?\\"\\r\\nLiala says, \\"No. I have nothing else to ask.\\"\\r\\nYou wave to Liala, \\"Take care then. And try to enjoy the game for what it is, a game where people are supposed to sometimes compete IC, but not be taking it OOC. It really is more fun for you too when played that way.\\"" \}), (\{ "rastalabor", 1251342080, "rastalabor has issued a warning to noein for this behavior." \}) \}), ([ "warnings":3 ]) \}) ]), "misc":([ "1215665419":(\{ "claims he was attacked w/o consent, and sought assistance for this from staff", (\{ 9265 \}), (\{ (\{ "ejuckes", 1215665419, "I sent him this opage:\\r\\nHello there.

But where I'm from, if you pull a weapon clearly in defense of another person, the judge -will- let it off. It's called the 'good sumaritan' laws....\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"You'll want to be *very* careful about using the good samaritan law. We have that here, too. It does not apply if you \\"escalate the conflict\\" and other cases - it is extremely limited. Mostly the good samaritan law applies to people who *aren't* doing violence, but accidentally hurt someone. For example, a doctor that tries to treat your injuries and might accidentally make them worse due to not having the right information.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"But that's another topic. The one at hand is...\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"1) Whether Danae is out of line with putting in the charge of assault. I haven't seen the logs but it sounds like it's a reasonable charge considering people did draw weapons, or possibly use them.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"2) Whether Danae is out of line for investigating a situation wothout having IC information to make her arrive, or possibly investigating to help an alt. I don't know the situation, or what Danae did - but please send log files if you think that Danae was out of line.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Well lets look at it IG. Gero started the violence, drew weapons and even made the the first strike. Everyone else present jumped in and gave him a couple of bumps. They all get regular ASSAULT CHARGES for defending injured people. His alt makes the charges. People complain to me OOC.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"There's no reason for Danae to suddenly pop back up. And then she knows everything that went on, and puts total assault charges for people that fought against her very violent and criminally inclined alt.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"and 3) Whether people testified against the people. Again, I remind you that a constable *MUST* put in any charges that someone requests, as long as they are plausible. It's plausible that there should be a charge of assault against people who draw weapons to use in a fight. Whether someone gets *arrested* is based on the evidence. If things are as clear cut as you say, then there should be zero evidence, and nobody should get arrested. So life goes on as usual. It's the ICO equivalent of the judge letting you off due to good samaritan laws.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"The only reason Khagra and Noire accepted their charges is because they're trying hard to be good people. The fact remains is that Gero used his alt to give big charges against people who fought against his alt. They tried to explain to his alt (Danae) that they were acting in defense of other people and their Clan property (Anabella) but she wouldn't entertain it at all.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"What outcome are you hoping from this conversation? You and I both know that Geradan is entitle to file charges of whatever he wants. Maybe he should have filed them through Jahren instead of Danae - but we both know he's allowed to file the charges of assault. So we can't do anything about that. I've already said I'll look over any logs you can provide to see if it looks like Danae was being unfair or helping alts.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"If Khagra and Noire accepted the charges because they were OOC told to, then that's bad. If they accepted their charges IC without evidence against them, because they're trying to be good, then that's an IC decision. People could have pointed out to them that there's no need to accept charges (or even go the the jail) if there isn't evidence.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"We also both know that if there was enough evidence to arrest them, Danae needs to arrest them. And can't let them off because they tell a good story (since that should have been taken into account in the @crime system already)\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Did you and Heidi both try to tell me you were all over alt abuse? This is a case that bears real looking into, Tony. Seriously. I know what you have to do, you have to do. But if you were really watching what happened IG and seeing it, we shouldn't be having this convo.

So why does it need to be required now? Can't you ask some questions?\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Of course I can ask questions. But if I know what happened, that does make it easier, wouldn't you say?\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Please, when I can give you four quotes from me - in this very conversation - asking for information so I can look into the possible alt abuse - please don't be so rude as to imply that when we say we look into alt abuse, that we would ignore this case for some unknown reason. Or to imply that we wouldn't look into it.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"As you yourself said: \\"if you were really watching what happened IG and seeing it, we shouldn't be having this convo. You'd be talking to Gero/Danae's player right now.\\" - I obviously wasn't watching what happened, which is why I asked for logs. Now that I know you don't have logs, I won't ask, but you hadn't told me that you had no logs (or if you had, I'd missed it) - I'll get logs from Gero's player, and look into it.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"And why do you assume there were no assists about Scarlett? Since you know we're not in the habit of telling players about other players assists.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"When I was snagged up into staff-land to appease Scarlett's player, I bet she didn't have much in the way of logs. If she did, then when I asked if so, I'd have been told yes or no, rather than a neutral answer\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"I also note that - even now, it's been a long time - but you are still sore about being questioned about what happened with Scarlett. Yet you're expecting me to do similar to Geradan. So I'd like you to bear that in mind - staff often talk to players - often players who feel they have done no wrong - so that we can look into situations like this and make sure the game is played fairly.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"If geradan asks if Jahren has logs of his behavior, what do you think I'm going to tell him? \\"No, there is no evidence that you did anything wrong at all, other than one players word. Would you mind sending me your logs and incriminating yourself?\\" - or would I perhaps not tell him whether you have logs or not. Since that way we can always give the same answer every time that question is asked.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"So you're just not going to ask any questions at all?\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Please. Stop. Read over our conversation. Don't assume you already know what I'm saying. Read the words I'm saying.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"I didn't get so deep into this until prompted. I was asking if you were going to ask questions about it. People complained to me, so I assist on the behalf of many players here.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"So I'll ask the same you are asking of me.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Did you not see how many times I asked for logs? Why would I be asking for those logs if I didn't want to look into it. Did you not see me say that I could ask questions? Did you not see me ask you not to be rude and imply that we wouldn't look into this?\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Sorry no complicated logs. But that obviously was required in order to tell me to be nicer IG to two other players I had to mediate discussions with even tho I told them OOCly I liked them as a player despite differences IG.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"No logs were provided against me when staff told me to be nicer IG.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Think back. What did we ask you to do? We said \\"Scarlett feels like you were being rude just walking out and leaving her with nobody to RP with when there are no other players online.\\" you said \\"I don't do that\\" and so we said \\"Good. So you agree you won't do that (which you aren't anyway) and Scarlett is happy? Good.\\" - if you weren't doing it anyway, I'm not sure what this huge \\"appeasement\\" that staff made you do was. Since you wouldn't be changing any behavior at all. Nobody called you a liar, or said you did anything you didn't do.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Now, unlike that situation, in *this* one I'm going to be talking to Geradan, and looking at whether he did something wrong. Possibly punishing him. Asking or telling him to actually change his behavior (rather than to continue doing what he's already doing) - and all without logs. I'm still going to talk to him. I'll see if he can give me logs, and if not, I'll listen to his side of the story to try and get the big picture.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"All I want you to realize is that your complaints of how supposedly badly treated you were in regards to Scarlett - I want you to realize that talking to players, and coming up with compromises is what we do. It's something you have regularly asked us to do towards other players. I want you to realize that in *one* instance we were asked to do it towards you, and did so. That is not unreasonable.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"And I want you to realize that what happened to you with Scarlett, you are asking me to do more than that to another player. Which I will do.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Jahren]: \\"Anyway, I've got to leave now. I'll be talking to Geradan about why his potential alt Danae was there, and looking at whether that was unfair when I have time. I'll also be talking to you about why Khagra and Jahren were there, and looking at whether that was unfair when I have time. Until I talk to both of you, and feel I have a reasonable version of the big picture, I won't be assuming anyone did anything wrong.

Nyx was bringing you into it, because I'm not gunna have my character change his opinion or decision, and I think it's ridiculous also that IG constables have no authority for field decisions.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Khagra]: \\"Well, the crime system has an IC and an OOC component, right? The OOC component is that instead of a whole lot of clerks, police stations, etc. there are just the PCs, and nobody can gather evidence about whether a crime was or wasn't committed, or who is guilty, until it's in the system. So OOC the constables need to put any crimes that get reported to them into the system. Then it has an IC component, where the constables have some level of leeway in how they approach the crime. They could put it in as a minor crime, normal, or major crime. They could suggest other crimes that might also be filed. And, of course, the IC aspect of gathering evidence. A constable can (and should, if the player feels like it) roleplay going around, finding witnesses and evidence, and getting them to testify either about innocence or guilt.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Khagra]: \\"In this case, it was claimed as an accident, though. There's no defined crime selection for this sort of situation. I understand the system, why it's there and how it works. And I like it. But I feel constables IG should have some sort of discretion and judgement in the 'field'.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Khagra]: \\"There is a defined procedure. If someone says \\"it was a crime. It was assault\\" then you put it in as assault. Then if it was an accident, everyone can put in evidence of \\"not guilty\\" saying \\"It was just an accident\\" and nobody is ever arrested. If EVERYONE is saying it's an accident, then no need to put in a charge. But if any PC wants to put in a charge, then you put in a charge, and let the evidence sort it out.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Khagra]: \\"And, being a constable, you can take that as a way to get RP, and investigate it.

During my whole time here, my character and myself OOC was told they had no way in these things. In this case, only the slave Ryan wants to have charges against Virendra.

So if the victim (Hush) in this case says it was just an accident, my char is going to go with that\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Necate/StoryBuilder Morana]: \\"No rush though, I didn't even know about it until Heidi just mention it to me now\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Khagra]: \\"I offer my reasoning both IG and OOC in a case like this, and why he acted as he did... And I offer to have my char resign IG if his decision making skills aren't seen suitable in cases like this.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Khagra]: \\"Slaves, just like any other players or PCs, can request that a file is charged.

I mean, they can... But it can't be used as evidence. This was briefed by Joshua to Jahren directly. If this is false, can we get a public clarification otherwise? That will avoid a problem like this, also. It doesn't boil down to that though, it's more about Jahren making his decision as a Detective, and he later left it up to sergeant Danae and Deputy Breeze\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Khagra]: \\"So the way you'd handle this particular case, is put in the charge that the slave requested. Let Ryan know he can put in his evidence. Put in Jahren's *opinion* saying \\"This was filed by a slave, and their word isn't worth much\\" and encourage Hush to put in her testimony saying that it was an accident. That would put it at -3 for innocence, and +1 or +2 for guilt, depending how much Ryan put his testimony in as. Which, unless more evidence comes up, is a pretty clear indication of innocence. And nobody would be arrested.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Khagra]: \\"The last you were briefed OOC, I believe when we had this same discussion about Chesh, was that all charges need to be put in if someone requests it. We had the same discussion about Geradan wanting to file charges, too. As for IC, slaves have always been able to testify and give evidence. The amount of weight paid to what the slave says, however, varies greatly on a case-by-case basis.

Or whether he investigates to prove it was an accident or not.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Khagra]: \\"Danae did suddenly turn up with a knowledge of what was going on tonight, too.

It comes to a point of being redundant and ridiculous.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Khagra]: \\"People can't roll with it IG because the assist wasn't about Jahren's IG decision. The assist was about Jahren's *player's* OOC decision not to put the charges in. You can put the charges into the system, and RP Jahren dismissing it and telling Ryan that it's not a crime, and there's no evidence. Then there wouldn't be any assists.\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Khagra]: \\"I didn't make my decision OOCly, though, so I don't get why we have to argue over this OOC :(\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Khagra]: \\"YES. If every time someone stubbs their toe, a PC reports it as a crime, he WOULD have to input that every time. Exactly. And then if people put in evidence testifying that it matched the crime that they charged it as (say, disturbing the peace, if they swore really loudly) they would arrest the person.

Naturally, promotions and demotions will occur at the same time, not just when staff have decided that a character has received enough favor or disfavor.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Aluine]: \\"I'd like to dispute it, honestly, because my char IG does a lot of things for the community personally, and that's how he gained his ranks to begin with. Also by this disfavor demotion, it implies that said bisclavret noble family that promoted him to begin with now disfavors him enough to strip him of some of his earned rewards.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Aluine]: \\"I'm sorry if you disagree with the system that we've implemented. It doesn't take into account where previous promotions have come from, obviously, and doesn't fully represent the favor of a specific House or noble. If your character is off doing plenty of good things, the favor they receive for doing this should greatly outweigh the disfavor they receive for any actions that may be deemed unfavorable. Of course, this is up to other characters to @favor Jahren for the good things he does do.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Aluine]: \\"An excellent way to gauge what people are @favoring or @disfavoring Jahren for is to go to the beggars and ask them for rumors about your character. So you can get an idea of what is, and isn't, socially acceptable or 'good'. Then you can try to steer clear of doing those things, or making the really good stuff you do that much more obvious.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Aluine]: \\"For all I know, people are making stuff up because of some OOC crap they might have with me. This system has giant holes in it, and it doesn't take any other real factors into play. I feel it's unfair and unnecessary to even have it in the game to begin with. My character is basically getting punished despite the self sacrifices he makes. It's unrealistic this would even happen at all.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Aluine]: \\"I'm sorry that you feel that way. It is a new system and there will be some chafing at first, though we are relatively happy with how it's working. Obviously, I can't address all of your concerns, so I'll be sure to leave the assist open and a note for StoryHost Azrael. Maybe he'll be able to better explain why the system is the way it is. Though I can assure you that staff judge each @favor or @disfavor individually, based on events in game. I can state with complete sureness that nothing is being made up through OOC maliciousness. Is there anything else I can do for you while you have me? Any other questions about the new system that I can answer?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Aluine]: \\"Maybe you're not getting what I'm saying... I mean, I know how the system works. It's a heartless machine that only factors in rumors. And you're only notified if you're close to social change if you're moving up. One reason why it's unfair, because if it's going the other way, you don't know until you get a random demotion with no actual IG play about it at all. Again, for example, Jahren was awarded ownership of his lands from a noble Bisc family. He was told when he resigned that he owned those lands. That means if he's lost any, someone had to have stolen them away by force or something. He even has a written IG document for it.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Aluine]: \\"Not to worry, I fully comprehend what you're saying. Would it be advisable, you think, that once a character reaches a certain amount of disfavor that they should receive a notification that they've reached that level?

Did Jahren do something IC to deserve it? Or did you, the player, do something to deserve your character getting demoted? Or did Jahren play politics better than his opponents, and thus shouldn't have been demoted? Or did you OOC put in work for Jahren's promotion and so you should keep it?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"There is no one clear answer. Every player sees \\"deserve\\" differently. There are certainly players who feel that Jahren deserves the demotion. There are certainly players who don't.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"The way I see it is, this part of the game isn't about which PC is nice or friendly. It's about which PC gathers the political support. And which PC provides opportunities to gain favor, or provides opportunities to loose favor. Jahren certainly IC provided opportunities to loose favor. And he certainly had other PCs that were willing to disfavor him IC. And either he didn't provide enough opportunities to gain favor, or he didn't have enough supporters willing to favor him. So in that sense, he earned a lot of disfavor and not much favor. So in that sense he \\"deserves\\" to be demoted. In the same sense that someone playing snakes and ladders \\"deserves\\" to fall behind in the game when they land on a snake, and they \\"deserve\\" to get ahead when they land on a ladder.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"Obviously no one really put in any @favor though, at the same time, so hard to believe there was anyone bothering to do so.  As per my post, I was pretty well against the idea of this system from the start, because things like this are going to happen to people that really don't want to be participating with things they don't want to.

Landing on an opponents property in monopoly. The analogy is that the player may not have done something bad, but the \\"rules of competition\\" within the game say that he looses out at this point.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"Who in the Bisclavret is going to be the one to demote him so suddenly?

I don't think Tomas and Charlot would knock Jahren down over impossible to prove rumors (aside from the ball)\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"Jahren's been noticed doing a few things. He *does* interact with people, if only in passing. He *does* have relationships with other PCs, and they interact with people too.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"Yeah, he hangs out with females.  But looking at his guild, most of his employees are female.  And that's the people he hangs out with, which is where those rumors are coming from.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"In what way do you find the system inflexible? If someone is very unpopular with their peers - and provides their peers opportunity to put in valid disfavor - then they can be demoted. Yes, it's inflexible in that way. That is the whole point of the system, it's a way to get promoted or demoted through actions.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"That's only if people actually stop to type in a @favor.  If they don't, even when they do favor said person, that person is still able to be the victim of those who do utilize the system.\\"\\r\\nYou shrug to Doctor Jahren, \\"The disfavor is based on things PCs observe. It doesn't matter what the reality is, only the front that Jahren displays to the world. Maybe Jahren needs to arrange things so there's no opportunity to disfavor him. He can do that by meeting in public (so he can't be accused of having affairs) or he could still have his affairs, but do it by not leaving together. And instead waiting in his room to welcome his partner when there are no witnesses. If nobody sees or hears about anything, they can't disfavor.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"There were 11 potential promotions this round. So there are PCs willing to @favor. You're right, most are quicker to @disfavor than to @favor - but that's something that can be worked on. If people aren't @favoring Jahren, then they're choosing not to support him for his good work.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"There really isn't any self defense against it.  You can opt not to use the combat system, and it's just fine.  But you can't opt not to participate in this one.  What's to stop people from just getting together and putting up a bunch of rubbish that gets processed?  It's impossible to go and OOC prove or disprove it was correct information.\\"\\r\\n\> You say, \\"But that's an IC choice they can make. (And Jahren can respond to it IC if he finds out. For example, right now he IC knows that he isn't being appreciated)\\"\\r\\n\> You tell Doctor Jahren, \\"Staff enter each and every favor or disfavor manually. So if players are putting in rubbish, staff would presumably notice. A little might go through, but a lot would be noticed. Do you really think that we haven't looked at what earned Jahren disfavor before telling you that he's being demoted?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"The self defence is to avoid any situations that you can get disfavored for. And to get allies that are willing to favor, and give those allies opportunities to favor.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"Well what people can disfavor for seems to be a very, very broad expanse of things.  Honestly, anything anyone says or does can be used to disfavor them in some way.  Depending how you word it.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Doctor Jahren, \\"That's why staff are involved. If the disfavor is too vague, the rumor might go in, but the disfavor will be worth 0.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"I don't get to actually see the system.  I don't know what rumors are doing how much damage.  There's no warning system.  If you're going to claim that the Fairbairn PCs decided to demote him, then they would've said something to him a long time ago to clue him in.  Which that never happened.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"So if they disfavor something like @disfavor 'Jahren thinks he's better than everyone else\\" - that would be worth 0. If they disfavor 'Jahren is telling people Hush isn't a good doctor because she takes risks, but he regularly does risky surgeries himself - that might be worth something.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"Yeah, that's one rumor which is pretty false.  He never bad mouthed her in public.  He sat her down in private and talked to her.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"They're saying something now. They're taking *part* of his land. The NPCs are speaking in deeds, and giving a clear message to jahren to shape up. Then they might give the land back when he improves (i.e. gains favor and gets promoted)\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"It doesn't matter. She posted on the forums, and talked to people. So the information got out to the public. And the public could respond with \\"Good on Jahren. Someone needs to deal with her hocus pocus\\" or they could respond with \\"Bossy Jahren! Who does he think he is?\\" - the direction it goes depends on the RP in the game.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"The problem with NPCs sending messages and similar is that the process happens quite quickly. If we're doing promotions and demotions every month - you and I both know that it can take more than a month for a staff member to get the chance to talk to someone.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"which can make it tricky if there is going to be back-and-forth. A one-way note could be possible, but even then, the demotion happens based on the total amount of favor at the end of the month. So if we send that mid-way through, it's possible that the PC gathers all the disfavor in the second half.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"ideally we could have some sort of system that checks every 2 weeks, or something. And can then give warnings at appropriate times - but that's coding and discussions about changing how things work, and the like. Which could happen (as you see, we've already made changes) - but won't happen immediately in the case of Jahren. Jahren will get promoted or demoted based on the rules that were in place at the time. And we can have a discussion about whether those rules should change for the future.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"So essentially any and all merit from before the system is pretty much meaningless... Which okay, that's fine.  But I really must insist, since this system is going to have such a big impact on chars like this (seems like it's stupidly easy to get someone demoted.  Gather up, watch them and start trash talking), with no actual way to defend oneself against it... Then I think you guys should take a lot more care in keeping people up to speed on just how much they're being impacted as things go along.  If that had been happening, then we wouldn't be having this talk right now, truthfully.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Merit from befor the system can be put in as @favor or @disfavor. And in larger cases it's already represented by previous promotions, such as Jahren had. So Jahren started at a higher position when this system began.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"Honestly, we posted about the system. Did a number of broadcasts about that post. We have two daily broadcasts reminding players about the system. Posted about how there was going to be promotions and demotions. And many reminders that to find out how PCs are going they can talk to the NPCs. It shouldn't be hard to talk with the NPCs and get a feel for whether your PC is gaining more favor or more disfavor.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I'm not sure what more we can do, other than putting in a running \\"score meter\\" - which kind of is against the organic nature of social politics.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"There are always going to be players that ignore systems until the systems have an impact on them. Now that characters are getting promoted and demoted, we've seen a big jump in the amount that players are using the system. And a big jump in the number of players actively avoiding disfavor or promoting favor.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"Well I dunno what to post on the forums, and I dunno what else to say.  I really don't know who would disfavor him that much, as he doesn't exactly have any real enemies.  So honestly, hard for me not to feel like I'm getting ganged up on to at least some partial OOC level.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"He has *many* enemies. You just might not know who they are. Play politics. \\r\\n  Snoop around. Ask PCs that claim to be Jahren's friend for favors, and see who comes through (since enemies are unlikely to help him) - discover what's going on. That's the whole point of the game!\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And you don't have to post anything on the forums. If you just post \\"I don't like the system\\" then it won't have an impact. We're trying to build a political game, so we need systems to encourage and support politics. The favor system isn't going to go away. But if you identify the problems that you have with the current system, you could discuss those problems, why they are bad, and see if anyone has suggestions to minimize or solve the problems.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"It's pretty impossible, since now they get to strike at him (since I guess he really does have a lot of enemies), but everyone is nice to his face except Joshua and Aysun (but she's never online too much), because he's always available and there's only a handful of people who haven't needed his talents at least once.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Such as your problem that there isn't warning before demotion.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"Well my first post didn't seem to warrant much of a response from you guys, looks like only one player even read it.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"And now I feel I have to change the entire attitude of my character in order to keep what he rightfully earned through actual merit and not just favor through gossip, which obviously doesn't sit well in my stomach.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Uh, your first post said \\"Nobody wants this system. The old system worked fine\\" - there were a number of responses from players saying \\"I like the system\\" or \\"I think it's good but has problems\\" and comments about how the old system didn't work perfectly fine. I thought you got a pretty comprehensive response from the other participants on the thread.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"WEll no, I said everyone I talked to personally said they don't like it.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You don't have to change your character at all. You can continue to play him non-political. And roleplay how Jahren, being non-political, responds to loosing his status.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"Do you understand my frustration at all?  I really need to know, because you really don't seem to care a whole lot.  Yeah, I'll get over it in a day or two, but I don't much like the idea of having to try to earn another promotion token to get it back.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Does Jahren seek out other, more political, allies to help him regain his lands? Does he withdraw, disgusted at not being rewarded for his work? Does he flaunt the situation and loose remaining lands while thumbing his nose at society? What story do you want to tell about your character. The system gives you a framework, but you tell the story. Gaining rank doesn't necessarily lead to  a better story than loosing rank.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"He wasn't trying to gain more rank.  He just wanted to keep what he earned.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"I understand your frustration - but from what I can see, you're frustrated with being on the loosing end of a system. You're frustrated, just as the monopoly player gets frustrated when they keep landing on opponents buildings and paying money. I see the frustration, but I don't see the problem.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"We now have a system where Jahren's enemies can hit at Jahren. And Jahren can hit at his enemies (if he can discover who they are.) Jahren is getting hit, and you're frustrated. But that doesn't mean it's bad for the game. It gives an extra dimension to the gameplay that didn't exist before.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"To be completely frank - I don't care what rank Jahren ends up as. I don't care if he becomes a Duke, or stays a freedman. All I care is that he rises or falls based on what happens in the game, and that it is the result of PC actions. That seems to be the case here. I don't see the problem. I DO see your frustration, but I don't see the problem with this outcome for Jahren.\\"\\r\\nYou ask Doctor Jahren, \\"So, where does that leave us?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"The upshot is, that Jahren's enemies played better politics than Jahren - this month. They had opportunities that Jahren left, and they took advantage. Next month, the situation may be different. That's up to you.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"Well I just described what the problem for my case was, buuut... Well, just glad I got to speak my piece on it.  But this -will- change how I have to play my character in quite a lot of ways.  Someone who managed to not be in politics who made strides based on his personal merits, now has to go and play in the realm of cut throat politics, essentially.  I mean, I do understand there's a lot of politics in this game, I knew it from the start.  Favor was gained and lost before, but instead of it being handled within the realm of players, it'd swept up into a coded system where now we're competing with a hidden scoreboard to stay alive.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"The system is in place, and I can't change that. It would be *highly* unfair of me to change the rules to avoid Jahren getting demoted after other PCs took action against him and were successful. Although the rules for future demotions could potentially change depending on how future discussions about the system go.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"Now people can leave rumors and not have to answer for taking shots at people, like they had to before.  It was easier to track where they were coming from.  Now it's an OOC command, and that person reamins entirely annonymous.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"It'll change how you play your character. Jahren will either have to learn to be political, or he'll have to accept that he'll loose his lands. But the system is designed to change how people play the game. It pushes them into playing political characters if they want rank. This is intended as a political game.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You're competing with a hidden scoreboard. But it's still in the realm of players.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And Jahren is free to take potshots back at his opponents. If he can catch them doing something worthy of disfavor.\\"\\r\\nYou suggest, \\"You might want to seek out Katrina. She's doing etiquette classes, so would be an obvious ally if Jahren is looking to play in the favor realms. She could perhaps help him learn how to not give any opportunities for disfavor while still doing the same actions as before.\\"\\r\\nYou ask, \\"I'm glad you had a chance to speak your mind. And I did listen. Anything further to discuss? Otherwise, I can send you back into the game, so Jahren can participate with the storm that's happening.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"He already talks to Katrina often (well, sometimes often).  He was aiding her with her research and such, before.  But Jahren isn't petty enough to do that to people.  The only people he trash talks are criminals whom are known to be criminals.  Otherwise, he talks to them in person.  With this system, unlike before, at least he was able to know what people were saying when it was happening and he could explain to his superiors and tell them what was going on to cause said rumors.  Now it's just not possible to do that.  instead those same understanding superiors are assumed to make a judgement against him without any person to person IG interaction.  That is one glaring, huge thing I really don't like about the system.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Well, the PC superiors don't. But the NPC superiors do.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"The Fairbanks sponsored Jahren. They said \\"This guy is worthy of land\\" and so the NPCs went \\"Good, good. We'll give him some land. It can be some of your land if you like\\" - then later the NPCs said \\"He's not worthy of the land, until he improves his act. We're taking it back. You Fairburns, you loose some status in my eyes because of your bad reputation.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"the Fairburns can still stand by Jahren if they want. Or they could cut him loose. But either way, the land is lost, and it's out of the Fairburn's hands.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It's far from perfect. It'd be nice to have the RP with the NPCs instead of just the land vanishing. Unfortunately, that's not something we have the manpower to support. And it'd be nice to leave the PC superiors in charge of the decision, but... that defeats the purpose of the system.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"The system also defeated that same thing too, Az.  Now the Houses can only promote people they want to if everyone else decides to put in @favor for them.  They really don't get to pick who they want to promote.  Naturally a Baron and such would want to promote someone that serves them directly, but if they don't have favor amongst the populace it seems, they can't just make that decision any more.  The spending of the tokens is now dictated.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"For the most part, if someone has earned a promotion from the house they have done *something* IC to earn it. Right? So the house members can favor for that. So the PC should be able to get promoted.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"But you said in posts before, that it'd be likely that favor coming from people within the same organization would probably not be worth as many points.  In not so few of words of course.  If a Baron wants to share his land with someone he personally favors, he/she just can't do that now.  (Which is how promotions through lands worked back then.  The land didn't just magically appear, it was part of a feudal plot.  That concept is still kinda in place today, but instead we have finances and credit involved.).\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"If someone only ever favors their own organization, then their favor would be worth less. If someone only ever favors and doesn't disfavor, then their favor would be worth less.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"If the avoirdupois are favoring people (of any organization) that does well and/or helps them. And is disfavoring people (of any organization) that does badly, then their favor would still be worth a lot even when they favor their own members.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I understand how the changes reduce the impact of promotion tokens. I've mentioned in the forum thread about it. And I understand why players want the promotion tokens to stay powerful. And I've explained in the forum why we've decided to reduce the promotion tokens.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Anyway, it's time for me to head off. Got some work I need to finish before I can go home, and it's getting late.\\"\\r\\nYou wave, \\"Take care. Hopefully Jahren will find his place in the new system. Believe me, he's not going to be the only PC that gets demoted. But he also has opportunities for promotion, if you create them.\\"\\r\\n\> Doctor Jahren says, \\"Good night.

So, I really have no defense will dealing with staff.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"However, your staffer Cersei, as awesome as she is in her own rights probably still holds shit against me for personal reasons and personal out of game convos which even if I had logs, I wouldn't give you.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"In an ideal world you wouldn't need a \\"defense\\" when dealing with staff. Staff are here to keep the game running smoothly for everyone. I'm concerned that you see things in such an \\"us vs them\\" attitude. Believe me, I'd rather finish my update to healing code that I was working on, than have this conversation with you. Fortunately, I do have a log of the conversation - I assume you can scroll up in your window to re-read it, but if not, I can copy/paste the relevant parts.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Kinda figured she'd give it up. Though I expect you noticed she told me to shut up when I touched certain areas/\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"OK. If she's got a problem with you, then that's something for the two of you to work out, or for you to avoid causing trouble for each other, and let it lie. If you don't want to give logs to me or discuss that problem, then that's your choice. But really, your relationship with her outside of the game doesn't really matter.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"And after she told you to shut up, did you? Or did you continue talking to her about a topic she obviously didn't want to discuss?\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"You read the complete log, apparently, so you'd know when she told me to shut up...\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"The argument started over why her chars would act the way they did to mine, despite trying to be in their trust again. In this case, was Zaria.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"I've also read the previous incidents you've had, and know you've been told that when you have a problem with another player, you should avoid forcing them to talk when they obviously don't want to - and instead either let it go, or assist and let guides talk you both through this.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I know you were warned about that in the past. I know this situation has come up a few times. I can see from the log that she was very clear about not wanting to discuss it with you. It is also very clear that you are discussing IC events, and making OOC accusations about them, which is something else we've had to talk about on many occasions.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"This is something that keeps coming up. Tell me what plan we can put in place to avoid this problem happening again in the future.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Honestly? Because staff mediation hasn't accomplished anything. I can keep going back to them as I'm sure you and Heidi know them clearly. At one point, I wanted to sincerely apologize and make amends, but then you went off on how bad a friend I was.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"I know there's a few people who will tell you I'm a horrible person, and I was to them at one point, but not without a reason most times.\\"\\r\\nYou ask, \\"Hmm? I didn't say that you were a bad friend. What I said was that I am friendly towards you, but wouldn't consider you one of my friends. Because I don't count you amongst my friends I didn't feel that you had any need to make amends to me personally. I apologize if that offended you. I also said that you used to be good friends with Heidi, and if you wanted to make amends perhaps you should talk to her. But that's a different incident, and a different topic.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I really don't want to talk about whether you're a horrible person, or Gandhi. I don't want to talk about whether Jahren was screwed over IC.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"What I want to state is that you are having trouble keeping IC situations IC, and you have, on a number of occasions, harassed other players OOC about something that happened IC, despite them saying they don't want to discuss it with you. If you feel you need to discuss something with another player, and that player doesn't want those discussions, then you go via staff. You know that. I know that. You aren't doing it.\\"\\r\\nYou ask, \\"So how do we fix that? Those are the game rules. You aren't following the rules. There's got to be a reason, and maybe we can sort it out, and come up with a strategy so these problems don't reoccur.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Yeah, there is a reason. It all started when Heidi basically forced me to concede to Scarlet's desires to be treated IG much better despite her IG attitude and actions. That set the tone for me, with you guys. Showed me something I'd really hoped and prayed I'd not see with this staff.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"That's where it started.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Doctor Jahren, \\"OK. So you're basically telling me that you feel staff are biased, and your unwilling to play the game by their rules. Is that correct?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"*you're.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"When staff tell me I need to start assisting about a certain thing, I will do so.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I see notes in your file going back to this time last year, where it's recorded that staff explicitly told you not to accost other players OOC and instead to @assist.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And I know there have been situations that haven't been recorded.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"There were other situations that weren't recorded with other players, that also weren't taken into effect, either. That didn't involve me.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Other players may have done the wrong thing at times, too. You may have done the right thing at times, too. I don't see that either has any bearing on this discussion.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Try to see things from my perspective. I run this game as a hobby. I have never seen a single cent of money from it. I enjoy building the game, and I enjoy giving players somewhere that they can come and - if they enjoy the game I'm providing - where they can have fun. I don't want to be a policeman. The game is open for all, I don't care who or what you are, but I do need the players to play nicely together, and follow the rules.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"You're only acting on the assists and information you're given at the time. I'm starting to understand the system of things now, and better. And yeah, I was harsh, but I feel I wouldn't be blatantly told to shut up unless I struck a true nerve.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"I don't want you to be a policeman, either. And I like playing with whatever chars you might mysteriously have playing with mine. And I like playing with Heidi's even too. As well as just about everyone else too.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You might not like the staff. You might have problems with the game. But you've been invited in to play with the game that I've been building. All I ask - ALL I ask - is that you follow the rules, and get along with the other players. Is that honestly too much to expect?\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Alright, I'll promise to include you with future issues regarding your staffer players, especially. But the reason I don't assist? I don't feel like every single thing should involve you. Not only for my personal reasons, but because you guys have enough stuff going on.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"The thing is, you might have struck a nerve. And you might be in the right. But I honestly don't care. Because you were harassing her OOC about something that happened IG. That is against the rules. You know it is against the rules. And, when you are talking to people you are trying to get along with, when you strike a nerve, that's when you stop pushing. Instead, you just pushed harder. I'm honestly having trouble seeing this behavior as acceptable, no matter how much you might have felt that you were in the right.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"I don't dislike staff in general. I just dislike a lot of your ideals and on another topic, your seemingly total lack of care for people leaving the game over your decisions.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I don't want you to include me with issues regarding my staffer players. I want you to @assist if you have an OOC problem with a player. Period. Any players. I want you to avoid confronting players without a guide present. Even if that means not discussing a topic until a guide can be there. If you are talking with a player, and it becomes a confronting situations like this, I want you to end the discussion, and assist.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Since this is an issue you've previously had problems with, and previously been explicitly warned about, I should be suspending you from the game. I'm not going to do that, because I believe that - despite the occasional incidents - you can keep yourself under control. And as long as you're careful to @assist rather than continuing discussions like this, I believe you can avoid this coming up again. But I want you to be exceptionally careful. @assist first, and quickly. If something that even *smells* like the same situation comes up a third time, it really will have to be a long term suspension from the game. And that's not me being nasty, that's just us applying the game rules to you the same as we do to other players.\\"\\r\\nYou shrug, \\"You are also free to dislike my ideals. I am far from perfect, although I try to be a good person. I design the game ideals around what I feel will bring fun to people. I can and will make mistakes.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"I will do as you state, Tony. Actually I just won't talk to the very few people that have went to you with personal problems with me. That'll solve everything, pretty easy.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"But I'm not going to get worked up about players leaving the game. Not everyone is going to enjoy every game. For every player that leaves because this isn't the game for them, another player will stay because we're giving them what they're after. I'm not going to try to please everyone, or I'll end up pleasing nobody.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"That's fine, you don't have to talk to them. If you roleplay but avoid OOC conversations, that will likely also help, while not restricting yourself as much.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Your statement about increased player activity is, however, very false. It's seen more declines. Definitely more alts online on ICO, but not regular staying unique players. That's been a noticeable decrease by a lot of people I've talked to.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"But I really do wish you would read over what you wrote in that last conversation. And perhaps look at how a player was telling you repeatedly that they didn't want to talk about it OOC and just wanted to RP, and how you kept pushing. I can't force you to, but I really wish you'd look at how your actions can create a problem. I'm not saying that others are flawless, but I *am* saying that you could have avoided the problem very easily.\\"\\r\\nYou ask, \\"When have I made statements about increased player activity?\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"You left a quote on the forum thread after Danae/Althalus' player stated their quitting of the game. You said specifically that ICO has seen a remarkable increase in playerbase.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"During the spider itch plot I pointed out that there was increased activity, despite the complaints from a vocal minority. I think the player statistics bear that out. I haven't made any recent comments about increased activity. You're right, we're in a lull at the moment.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren adds, \\"And I just won't talk to them OOC at all, unless necessary to revolve an IC scene.\\"\\r\\nYou ask, \\"Did I? I may have made a comment about how we had an increase in comparison to CM, perhaps.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Doctor Jahren, \\"I think that sounds sensible. Avoiding OOC conversations, except to clarify something about the IC situation, will probably make this into a non-issue.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"On that topic, yeah, the last time I was called up to staff land for an OOC altercation with another player was about... I dunno how many months ago, and was finally addressed by Ny-whatshisname.\\"\\r\\nYou admit, \\"I have no idea how to spell his name either.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Was about two months ago, about something that happened about seven months before that.\\"\\r\\nYou tisk, \\"Well, it doesn't look like he tracked that conversation for other staff. So I'm not sure what it was about. Is it relevant, though? Or did you want to get zapped back into the game?\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Actually is kinda revelent, because that was the last time I was brought up to talk to staff about my OOC behavio---Err, no. Actually, I questioned someone why they'd openly disfavor Jahren for being a neglectful doctor after he was summoned/requested to see to them, then not be on at the same time as me for over two weeks.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"That disfavor came -after- he and her char were on at the same time, and he spent a lot of money to see to her recovery, without a repayment or reward.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Yeah, that sounds like an unduly harsh thing to blame Jahren for.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I assume you put in an @assist querying the disfavor. And Ny grabbed you up just to check what happened, and things were sorted out?\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"I just haven't gotten myself used to including you guys in every dispute, I guess... I deal with irrate people all day long at the airport and can work things out, without flexing any authority at all even if I can. So I prefer to engage and deal with it person-to-person. Again though I will follow protocol as you state is the rules (though can you email me the section where it says this, at some point?)\\"\\r\\n\> You say, \\"Getting used to including staff is a good thing.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"I'd still like to have that reference in the articles of the rules so I can look at it when I need to, even if only to remind myself of this rule.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"However, my harassment ended tonight when I myself walked away from the situation.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I can't email it to you, because it's the rules due to you being told to do so by a staffer. I have little interest in keeping a lawbook full of clauses and exceptions. Instead, I expect players to show good intentions, and ask staff for assistance if they are unsure how to proceed, or if something is acceptable or not.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Normally I don't try to shoot in a last word. I just say I want to walk away and I do.\\"\\r\\nYou suggest, \\"A lot of players tell me they write themselves notes about things like that, and put it on the monitor as a reminder.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"I dunno what logs you've bee given, and I won't ask to see them because the last times I asked staffers to show me, they wouldn't.\\"\\r\\nYou ask, \\"So things are sorted out, should I sent you back?\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Yeah, we don't provide logs.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"That's okay, but if a punishment is being placed forth, then I'd demand the proof. I'd hope you would in that case?\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Also, digital logs can be altered without proof of alteration, so they are generally bad evidence anyway.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Even in cases of punishments we don't provide logs, no. But punishments, when given, are intended to stop problems from reoccuring. I have no interest in \\"punishing\\" the players - I just want whatever problems they are causing to stop.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Can I ask why you won't provide evidence to reinforce a punishment such as banning or suspension?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You're right about logs being able to be altered. The lack of evidence in the digital age is why one thing I am adamant about is that if a player is caught lying to a staffer they are instantly suspended, no questions asked. We need to be able to trust the information we are given, if we're to be fair to both parties.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"After all, staff will demand logs in order for players to defend themselves. It should go both ways.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Doctor Jahren, \\"This isn't a court case. There is no \\"burden of proof\\". It's much more similar to a house party, where the host can request that any of the guests leave if they feel that guest is creating problems. We don't provide logs because, in some situations, it can cause problems for the other players. In other situations, we are gathering the information through other means, and may not be using logs. To be consistent, we therefore don't provide logs as a general rule.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"The other reason is because we already have a lot of paperwork to do, and it all takes time away from us building the game. I'd rather spend my time making something fun for the players than quibbling over legalese.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"In certain cases when a log is used to bring a case against someone, it should be provided when asked, when it's used to bring up said case. Right?\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"As far as assists go.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"No. Again, this isn't a court case with presentation of evidence. Log files are requested so the staff has as much information as possible when dealing with a situation. The staff aren't here to prove to the players that they did something wrong. The staff are here to deal with an issue if it arises.\\"\\r\\nYou smile, \\"Awesome! That's what we're all here for!\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Because honestly? I love ICO. I love playing here, and I like Heidi and you both. We just don't see eye-to-eye, and... Unfortunately probably will keep bucking horns in the future. But it's not personal. I just see things different.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And for my part, I aim to get the healing code fixed up and working properly again. And then to put in the upgrades that this change was designed to allow.\\"\\r\\nYou agree, \\"It's not personal. I've got zero problem with you on a personal level, and I don't resent that we disagree on topics. You are always welcome here, as long as you stick to your word about making as few problems as possible. And you're always welcome to let me know when you disagree with something.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I might not change it. But I'll listen to your point of view.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren pokes his tongue out, \\"You know I'll give my harsh opinion.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Oh, I know.\\"\\r\\nYou wave, \\"Going to send you back into the game. Gotta write this all up before bed.\\"\\r\\nYou cough pathetically, \\"And I'm sickly this week, so I can't stay up late.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"The reason isn't random or unfounded. I staffed on a ton of games in the past. Took my blows from players too. The ones I listened to were the ones that were up-front and direct. But that's just the Army part of me.\\"\\r\\nDoctor Jahren says, \\"Yeah man, go get some rest! Sorry for all the issues. I want to be working with Nyx soon as she's back into the swing of things about various things, which will hopefully tie-in and help with the healing system.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Sounds good. We should soon be able to support more meaningful healing items, so it's good timing.\\"\\r\\nYou wave.\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Phoenixbd/Doctor Jahren]: \\"Sorry for the trouble, tony\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Phoenixbd/Doctor Jahren]: \\"Dude, things happen.

I'll see if I can find them for you.\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard tells you simply, \\"First like two sundays ago Bayard ordered Ryan to leave the meeting because he believed ryan is a loudmouth and a gossiper and doesn't trust him, never has trusted him. Then just a moment ago, he told Ryan to shut his mouth because he wouldn't stop with smartass comments. In both instances I received rather mocking little ooc message like \\"Ya know that is excluding someone from RP lolz ;)\\"\\r\\nYou ask, \\"What other options do you have to allow Bayard to still act in-character, while allowing Ryan to continue to participate in the scene?\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard shrugs, \\"The first time it was ryan's player, the second time it was brooks' player and then Ryan's player. I just think it's stupid that I am doing something for IC reasons, then getting bitched at it oocly.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Well, bear in mind that we take OOC consideration into account on a daily basis. Every time you log out of the game, and the other players don't instantly start roleplaying that Bayard vanished into the air, we are taking OOC into account. Similarly, this is a social game, where we try to include as many players as possible. If there is a specific reason why you *can't* include Ryan, then that is fine.\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard tells you, \\"well in the last scene, they came up with a reasonable compromise where Ryan would only talk to Brooks and not directly to bayard. But as far as private business regarding the House, bayard does not trust Ryan one tiny bit.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"But in a situation where Ryan is at an official house meeting, representing and speaking on behalf of one of the house members, that seems... like a rather strange justification to exclude him. If Ryan was running around screaming, or something, then maybe it would be different.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Bayard doesn't have to trust Ryan. That gives plenty of fertile roleplaying opportunity.\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard lifts his high right eyebrow at you, \\"Well he has the power to send a slave out of the room, so why wouldn't he if he doesn't trust them?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Imagine Bayard dealing with Ryan, while making clear he doesn't trust Ryan. Ryan is Brooks' slave - and Brooks is gentry in the house. If Brooks says that Ryan is trustworthy, then Bayard is forced to deal with Ryan - and can be as angry about that, and mistrustful of Ryan as he wants. While still allowing you to include Ryan in the roleplay.\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard shakes his head, \\"You don't just knowingly include someone you dont trust in your private business, thats not logical.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Sir Bayard, \\"He only has the power to send a slave out of the room if he doesn't mind offending the person that the slave represents. Imagine if I was at my office, and having a meeting with representatives from the different tech companies. I'm meeting with Microsoft, Apple, and Google. Now imagine if they all arrive at the meeting, and I see that the Google representative is a woman. I have the power to send someone out of the meeting. If I sent her out of the meeting, I could understand why Google would be very upset at my company.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"So Bayard, representing the Avoirdupois, sent away the representative of one of their gentry. That is highly insulting to the gentry, regardless of how Bayard feels about the slave.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"But... the real answer is... it doesn't matter. If Bayard doesn't trust Ryan, that's fine. Roleplay it. Find some way of roleplaying it *without* excluding the player. That means not telling the character to \\"shut up and not do anything\\" and not sending the character out of the room. That kills roleplay for the player. You can find some way of roleplaying Bayards *IC* dislike without excluding the character. Force Ryan to sit on the floor instead of on a seat. Force Ryan to address Bayard as \\"Most High and Glorious Sir\\" and to address himself as \\"this unworthy slave\\". Complain to Brooks if Ryan acts in an untrustworthy way. All of those options create *more* roleplay rather than *less*\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard just shakes his head, \\"Well, that may be but if this is the case then i just wont take bayard to any more house meetings because I personally believe by chosing to be a slave, you dig your own hole. So that's fine, I will make someone take notes or something.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Sir Bayard, \\"That's your choice. You certainly don't have to participate. All I'm saying is that if you *do* participate, it's not good OOC gamesmanship to exclude other players.\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard just shrugs, \\"I just don't think someone should get to chose to be a slave then bitch when they are treated like one, but i believe death should be permanent too so maybe i am just a dick.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Sir Bayard, \\"Look at the difference between slaves and other ranks. There is a three rank difference. Look at the difference between gentry and baronets, there is a three rank difference. The difference between Bayard and Nan is almost identical to the difference between Ryan and Brooks. And the difference between a commoner and a slave is much LESS than the difference between a gentry and a commoner. We expect gentry PCs to roleplay with commoner PCs without telling them to shut up. We expect the same for slave PCs.\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard shifts his watery jet-black right eye and his scarred, pure-white left eye slightly, \\"I would tell a commoner to shut up too...and I have told a gentry to shut up...\\"\\r\\n\> You tell Sir Bayard, \\"When a player decides to play a slave, they agree to a number of limitations. They can't carry weapons without permission. They can't attack free people without risking execution. They can't join whatever guild they want. At no point do they agree that they will stand silently and not roleplay. That would just be silly, in a roleplaying game.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Sir Bayard, \\"And that's fine. You can tell whoever you want to shut up. As long as you don't actually force them to stop roleplaying. If they are screaming, or carrying on, you can tell them to shut up. And then roleplay with them from that point onwards, with their PC talking calmer, or otherwise responding. But if you tell them to shut up, and then expect the player not to engage in the scene - you are blocking them from RP. And that is bad.\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard points out, \\"Getting sent out of a meeting does not prevent a player from roleplaying.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Sir Bayard, \\"It does, if the character is actively involved in the group that the meeting was for.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Sir Bayard, \\"If you are having trouble understanding what I'm explaining, instead of explaining what we're aiming for in the game, I can simplify it into a set of rules for you to follow. Would that be easier?\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard tells you, \\"I understand what you are telling me, i just respectably disagree with it.\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard rubs his head, \\"And I need to go to bed really bad...\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard supposes to you, \\"If you are able to find the exact policy on slave roles, forward them to me and i will try to comply the best i can.\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard stares at you, \\"You there?\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Sir Bayard, \\"You are very welcome to disagree. But like the permadeath policy, the game is set up this way for a reason. I'm not having any luck finding the forum post about slaves :/ I'll see if I can dig it up later, or I'll get the guides to write up something about slaves.\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard nods to you, \\"I'd appreciate it.\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard mentions to you, \\"By the way, this may not mean a thing to you, but in another game I play, they suspended slave characters because too many people were crying about this same thing we are talking about.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"But the rule of thumb is quite easy. Treat slaves as if they were two ranks below commoners. So a freedman should treat a slave the same way a burgher would treat a freedman. Or the same way a knight would treat a gentry. So a slave should be expected to behave respectfully towards their betters, just as gentry are expected to behave respectfully towards knights. But a slave may also feel free to disagree (politely) or otherwise socially engage with a freedman, the same as a gentry member can with a knight.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And the difference between slave and knight is the same as the difference between freedman and baron. So if it wouldn't be appropriate for a Baron to tell a house member freedman to get out of a meeting, then it's not appropriate for a knight to tell a slave to get out of a meeting.\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard nods to you, \\"Okay.\\"\\r\\nYou tell Sir Bayard, \\"It does mean something to me. I'm always looking to examples from other games to discover what does and doesn't work. For example, we've suspended child characters here. But I don't see a reason to think we should suspend slaves. What we're talking about here is an issue where you are excluding another PC because of lower rank. As I pointed out, it's no different from a Baron excluding a freedman. So we can't remove that issue unless we got rid of all nobles entirely. If you keep roleplaying with slaves, and just treat them as a lower rank than \\"the average commoner\\" you will be fine. No need to send them out of the room or expect them to stay quiet.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Slaves here are the roman-style slaves. The kind that would live in your house, and basically be members of your family (admittedly, members of the family that do the chores around the house...) - not the american style of slaves that work in fields and don't interact with their masters.\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard shifts his watery jet-black right eye and his scarred, pure-white left eye slightly, \\"You mean like the slaves they would turn into gladiators and send ruthlessly into the slaughter for their entertainment?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"No. I mean the slaves that would grow up in a roman household, born to other slaves from the household. The type where often generations of the same slave family would be owned by generations of the same roman family. The gladiator slaves would typically be prisoners of war.\\"\\r\\n\> You say, \\"But if someone wanted to roleplay a gladiator slave, that would be fine. It doesn't change the way we should include them in our RP.\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard nods to you then, \\"Alright, I understand...\\"\\r\\nSir Bayard begs you, \\"Can i go to bed now? it's 5am.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"But gladiators are a fun idea. If Bayard wants to organize gladiator matches and make his slaves fight, that's a good way to include them in RP while still showing Bayard dislikes them.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And of course you can go.

I was told that Bayard passed through once, then came back a second time and had a longer conversation. And that the PCs involved were very familiar with him. So they figured it was OK to recognize him after having RPed with him for a while. I don't know if any further discussion happened to add more information since that time.\\"\\r\\nBayard tells StoryHost Azrael pointedly, \\"How about the fact that I was only in the same room as all of them for a total of maybe a minute or two. I didn't get close to any of them, I hardly even talked. and then somehow Noe is just gonna be like: oh that is Bayard. And then the rest, seeing that as their IC loophole, just agree. what the hell is that?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Bayard, \\"I don't know \\"what the hell that is\\" - I was just pointing out that the preliminary conversation showed that it wasn't clear-cut. That the other players felt it was reasonable, while you felt it wasn't reasonable.\\"\\r\\nYou repeat to Bayard, \\"Please do calm down. We are here, we listen. Could you mayhap provide a log of the events? It would help clarify what was Rped and given out.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael reminds Bayard, \\"And please watch the tone of your language. As I said, we're being polite, and I expect you to be equally polite when speaking with the volunteer staff.\\"\\r\\nBayard tells you, \\"No, i am sorry i don't have the log.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Then could you share who all was there so we ask them for a log?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Bayard, \\"We'll try to get a log from one of the other PCs present, and have staff look it over.\\"\\r\\nBayard lists to you, \\"Noe, Aedina, Edmond...I think Brooks...\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael agrees with Bayard, \\"If you were in the room for less than a minute, didn't get close to anyone, and hardly talked, then it does sound less likely that they would be able to recognize Bayard. And that does sound like a valid reason to reverse the disfavor.\\"\\r\\n04:20 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"Particularly if they all revoked their testemony to the magistrate when ryan convinced them that bayard was just sick in the head, not actually being disrespectful\\"\\r\\nYou note to yourself, \\"We shall contact them and ask for the log, hopefully read through them. What I suggest to you, if such is possible, is to calm down, and then write down everything you can think on why they should NOT have recognised you. I understand you listed many things already, but maybe a systematic scroll that is written over time, might also give other examples that you think is reason enough for them not to recognise you.. It would help us particularly if we can find no logs. Could you please do that?\\"\\r\\nBayard nods to StoryHost Azrael, \\"It wouldn't have to be reversed if it were properly investigated in the first place. You can understand why that makes me angry?\\"\\r\\n04:21 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"he's so damned rude!\\"\\r\\nBayard nods to you, \\"I will try.\\"\\r\\n04:22 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"how much time does he think we have?\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar says, \\"We investigate as much as we can in the time we have. We are all volunteer staff, which means that while you pay to play, we are actually paying to work on the game.\\"\\r\\nYou appreciate Bayard, \\"Thank you. I am awaiting then a scroll from you and I will ask for logs. If things will be reversed we will make a fun plot from it for you. We understand that you are angry, but we still ask that you remain respectful in your tone toward us. We will go over the events and return to you once we investigated everything.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods to Bayard, \\"Sure. But considering the game is staffed by volunteers, time is limited. I would love to deal with everything properly, but until I can pay staff to get the jobs done, there will always be jobs that can't be done due to lack of manpower.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Meerclar says, \\"So we do try to get to everything, even if you don't think it's as quick as it could be.\\"\\r\\nYou reassure Bayard, \\"If we find that recognising Bayard was improper, Bayard and you both will come out positively, regaining the rank and getting RP both.\\"\\r\\nYou inquire, \\"Are we as far in this conversation as is possible right now?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"We need the logs and the scroll. I do not think we can progress before we obtain those?\\"\\r\\nBayard honestly states, \\"It just...I don't like having to \\"undo\\" things that have already happened ICly...it's just...a matter of proper roleplaying and respect.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods to Bayard, \\"Sure. Nobody likes undoing things. But the other choice is to require approval and constantly \\"freeze\\" scenes until there is time to properly investigate. Nobody would want that solution, either.\\"\\r\\n04:27 [LocalGame\|Meerclar] \\"\\"Proper roleplaying' might have included him OOC teling the people in the scene that they couldn't recognise him\\"\\r\\nBayard nods to StoryHost Azrael understandingly, \\"And no one needs that.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael agrees, \\"So, it's a case of stuck between a rock and a hard place.\\"\\r\\nBayard rubs his head, \\"if there's nothing else you need from me, I am super sick and it's 1:30 in the morning.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"we can not code and build everything. If we would only take coded and built things, the world would be very static. In fields which are not coded, it is important that we at times use ooc to do things. What would aid you in disquise is eg emitting how you conceal yourself. That gives info to other people on how to respond to you. eg mask my voice, drift my voice, bite my words, mumble only - these all hint that you change your voice. Or have a shawl at your face of face bandana or whatever those thigns are called, and speak through it. So other people have it pointed out what in RL they would see t first sight. You can change the way you walk and other aspects too. But it is very important that you aid other people in seeing what happens by RPing it out. At times it can be seen as excessive. but it also means, that misunderstandings are avoided.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael waves to Bayard, \\"Take care.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"All right. I shall then see to things getting rolled. You will not need to undo anything. You can easily RP that you don't know why you are demoted. And if we want a reverse, we can do a VP that tried to smear your name, and then people can hunt him down.\\"\\r\\nBayard mentions to you, \\"I did modify his voice. I made it clear he spoke in a very gruff tone and very poor common with some sort of accent.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael agrees with you, \\"Wise words. Half the problems aren't caused by anyone doing the \\"wrong thing\\" and just by players assuming different information.\\"\\r\\nYou smile at Bayard, \\"I am letting you 'off the hook' for now, so you can sleep.

Zeiss, Whie and Faust.\\"\\r\\n\> You add, \\"And that you when you no longer were staff forgot to inform us about it so we could remove the traits. First of, private characters are never to have that staff-trait, only actual staff bodies, VPs and the like should have them, which I do believe was made clear when you were staff also.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKnockles says, \\"I found Artemis' conduct to be... well, unbecoming. She started off the \\"interview\\" with hostile accusations of my presumed guilt, rather than neutrally collecting all the information regarding the issue at hand and THEN making a judgement. From the beginning, I felt attacked, rather than \\"being worked with to come to a solution\\".\\"\\r\\n\> You nod, \\"From what I understand you felt attacked.\\"\\r\\n\> You tell Knockles also, \\"Artemis acted on my request as I've not been able to catch you.

Although she seemed to think that throwing your name/title around would somehow validate her accusatory tone/word choice. (More word choice, since \\"tone\\" isn't really a thing in a text-based medium.)\\"\\r\\n\> You say, \\"I am sorry that you feel attacked and not heard. I've looked over the information I had available, and based on that knowledge come to a ruling of which you needed to be informed, as well as give your input to. The matter of deleting characters was very set, and this is what she informed you about.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKnockles responds, \\"Actually, I don't remember that being said, I was staff way back... I think right around the time the game went Gold. Things were a lot less structured under Azrael, and working as part Plotter, part Builder, I occasionally made VPs and NPCs. At that early time, I set a few of my chatter PCs to not take up roster-space, rather than having to set it for each new chatter I made for whatever random plots or Builder-experiment I was running. I forgot I had done that... well, until Artemis brought it up earlier today, actually... wish I had remembered, but the span of time involved sort of didn't agree much with my already-bad memory skills.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKnockles nods, \\"Oh, yeah, as soon as she said I had too many char slots, I was already loading up the roster to figure out how many extra I hand and which ones I had to delete before she even brought it up. That was a no-brainer.\\"\\r\\n\> You admit to Knockles, \\"Having a bad memory isn't really an excuse when you break the rules of the game. As former staff you are supposed to inform staff about those properties you had set in your player bodies. You have been playing as a regular player for a long time and must have wondered why you had the option to create more characters than Zeiss, Faust and Whie.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKnockles says, \\"Actually, I thought that was from having a Premium Account. As I explained to Artemis, I had bought it for the STPs primarily and also for the Premium-only race-options for new chars. I never actually looked to see how many slots it gave me, I just made chars until the slots were full.\\"\\r\\n\> You nod, \\"Where you premium 4-5 years ago?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKnockles wonders, \\"When did I make Knockles here? I know I've intermittently switched back and forth between Premium and Standard over the years... depending on my current funds, etc.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou hear an unpleasant chittering sound somewhere near the ceiling.\\r\\n\> You nod to Knockles, \\"Yes, you've switched back and forth, and even while playing with a regular account you had the option to create more characters. So that option is not something new.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKnockles admits, \\"Actually, I didn't even realize the limit on normal accounts was what it was, I thought all regular accounts had five chars... and Premium had eight... with Premium granting three extra... based on what my roster looked like... should have probably researched that rather than assuming it was what I was seeing.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething with numerous legs climbs across your foot.\\r\\n\\r\\nKnockles sighs, \\"I mean, I suppose \\"Ignorance of the law is no excuse\\", but I'd at least bid for a lesser punishment considering it was a non-malicious accident.\\"\\r\\n\> You tell Knockles, \\"As for your talk about the incident tracker. Skotos is a private company and has therefore no obligation to share what information they have about you with you. Every time a player is talked to with a guide about issues like alts, exploration, ooc abuse and cheating, it is added to the incident tracker.\\"\\r\\n\> You say, \\"I have looked through the notes, and for your warnings you were verbally informed about them that you received an official warning.\\"\\r\\n\> You say, \\"These cases go back many years and covers various topics. But as Artemis said, there's too many to list them, nor am I interested in doing so now. Our conversation here will be added to the incident tracker for future reference.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWill the sun -ever- shine again?\\r\\n\> You inform Knockles also, \\"I do not like the way you started to attack Artemis during your conversation with her, and your threats about sending the log to CE. You could instead have asked her to take a pause because you felt attacked and uneasy with how she handled the situation. Attacking a guide, or staff for that matter, is only bound to cause annoyance and less willingness to listen to you.\\"\\r\\n\> You say, \\"Anyway, We still have the initial issue of you forgetting to inform staff about the properties you set in your player characters when you were staff. The usual procedure then was to expand your rooster to be able to hold more characters. If I recall right (and I was staff back then), the notion of setting properties in the actual staff-bodies was a thing that was encouraged some time later.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA breath of fresh air blows through the window, giving you a moment's respite before the stale, deathly air consumes you once more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind moans like a dying woman as it buffets against the tower.\\r\\n\> You tell Knockles, \\"Due to that, I unfortunately have no other option than to suspend you for a month.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKnockles says, \\"That wasn't a threat, that was just a friendly heads-up, rather than doing it without saying anything and having it sprung on someone later. I prefer to send issues to CE. I've had bad experiences with the volunteer-force staff in the past, so I like to cover for myself with full documentation and sending things up to the corporate employees at CE.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKnockles says, \\"Setting the properties in bodies was a regular practice when I was staff, though I was initially trained in Lovecraft Country: Arkham By Night, so I did things according to their common practices. Not that that's an issue or anything, just felt like clarifying.\\"\\r\\n\> You understandingly nod.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill the sun -ever- shine again?\\r\\n\\r\\nKnockles chuckles, \\"Actually, had I never been on LC staff, I probably would have never played ICO...\\"\\r\\n\> You smile, \\"It's how it goes, isn't it?\\"\\r\\n\> You ask Knockles, \\"Do you have any finishing comments you wish to share?\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nKnockles admits to you amusedly, \\"Nothing that isn't petty and I'd likely come to regret after emotional detachment from time separation...\\"\\r\\n\> You nod to Knockles smilingly, \\"I'm glad to hear that.\\"\\r\\n\> You smile at Knockles, \\"Well, if there's nothing else, then this is it for you and I'll see you around in a month.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nKnockles grins amusedly, \\"Shame they don't tend to log stuff like that in the incident tracker.

Shouldn't be basing IC actions on information like that, anyway.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You should RP realistically even if none is online.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss nods, \\"Alright...?\\"\\r\\nYou ask Master Zeiss, \\"how do you plan to go on?\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss admits, \\"Head out with Dona, make a brief appearance, and escape back to Zeiss' room.\\"\\r\\nYou explain, \\"I don't want this to be a repetitive talk we go through once a week ending with a: bad boy, don't do it again, yes mom, I got it.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"That also means that if talk doesn't help, then we have to consider other ways to cooperation being ensured.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I don't mind you trying to escape. I don't mind you managing to escape. I mind you not RPing according to the surrounding.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael suggests, \\"YOu can also try other things, like doing a dice roll to see if he escapes, or other things to make sure there's a chance of being captured, and a chance of escaping.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"or play through a combat and see who wins (maybe just a combat with one hero, then assume if Zeiss wins he gets the chance to make a run for it)\\"\\r\\nYou confirm, \\"We want you to have a chance. Both to win and lose.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss says, \\"I'd just prefer to have it be a plot that works out, if I'm forced into keeping the armband on despite attempts to get it off. (Not an OoC fan of that plot anymore... not as fun as I was hoping it would be due to garbage like this.) So if I'm going to do it, I'd rather not it be \\"Yay, we caught Zeiss after a day\\" and move on to something else. I'm not a fan of the transient nature of almost ALL plots in ICO. None of them have an effect that lasts (even if they're lengthy plots like Spider Itch, as soon as it was over people forgot about it because it created such vitriol).\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss notes to you, \\"The chances are already excessively skewed toward heros winning, because... well, that's how stories end. Note: how they -END-, not begin.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"i am sorry, but none forced to wear that ring. And you have IG ways to remove it. You have to find them. It was your characters decision that led to consequences to your character.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael suggests to Master Zeiss, \\"Then make a longer term plot. Avoiding capture doesn't do anything except extend the plot, and you need to make sure that you fairly avoid capture.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss says, \\"And that's why I'm RPing all the \\"get them\\" now, isntead of just ignoring it as was my initial desire.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"If you want longer term consequences, try other avenues that have a longer term effect. Make a group of people that band together to lie in testimonies and get effective immunity from the law. Play politics to get the laws changed. Things like that.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss notes to StoryHost Azrael, \\"I've tried to do that. Mildly to very impossible.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It is not impossible, you just have to keep doing that. Because running away will not achieve what you aim for. It will alienate you and make you feel miserable at the end.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss says, \\"Especially when every time I turn around someone is ready to tear out Zeiss' throat for no other reason than he's Zeiss. Especially when YOU decide to excommunicate him and make his a social outcast.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods to Master Zeiss, \\"It is very hard to make permanant changes. Of course. Otherwise those changes would be regularly made and undone, and would be... um... transient.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"it will make people avoid you and makes the plotting of politics even harder for you.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Thus you'll get into a bad spiral that is hard to break.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss pffts, \\"I've been stuck in that damn spiral since day 1, just because no one wants to ally with a 'villain character', they all want to take him down and 'be the hero'.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael notes to Master Zeiss, \\"I don't think they want to tear out his throat just because \\"he's Zeiss\\" - I suspect it has more to do with his IC behavior, and that of his allies. Same as the excommunication.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss says, \\"When i got sick of that, I tried to turn him around and make him more of a father-figure type, and that was going well until the whole excommunication BS.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"The more you include the wishes of other people in your actions (IG) the more they will work with you. And that isn't exactly true. Both present had chars who were actively helping and plotting FOR Zeiss for over a year.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And how do you think you can react to the excommunication?\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss nods to you, \\"And where did that get them/him? Nowhere.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It got him over a year of power where he had to do nothing and got everything. A year of GAMING EXPERIENCE for you.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss admits to you, \\"I'd really frickin' love to react to it in a way that gets it rescinded ASAP because, honestly, ever since that plot started I've been debating quitting.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"That plot was the reaction of your own actions and that of Temperance.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You can work IG to change it.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"People are willing to help, if you are willing to take help. However Zeiss has to evolve for that.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"if you refuse him to change, or pretend to change, then people's attitude toward him won't change.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss notes to you, \\"Work IG ove rthe course of YEARS. Sorry, I've played Marrach too long to have any interest in plots measured in \\"years\\".\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"But don't blame others for his own actions.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"If you do nothing then the years will be an eternity. If you do someting then the years might get less. It is up to you.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"but don't blame others for HIS actions.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss says, \\"He was changing. He did change. Then the excommunication happened, and he put on the armband as a result of that, and that basically reverted him back to what he was and THEN SOME.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"not use his own actions and consequences to justify ignoring other people's actions toward your character.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss says, \\"And what is there to do? You're the plotter, guide me in the plot?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"None forced you to wear that armband, Ant. HE decided that. I can not be held accountable for that. Nor any other pc. You have to face the consequences of his actions.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Master Zeiss, \\"That's the situation before you, though. You said you didn't like transient plots, then you complain that this plot is likely to last too long? What actions has Zeiss taken to convince the church to lift the excommunication? If he continues to get caught murdering, it likely will take years, and he'll likely have a band of heroes on his tail. If he does the opposite, it's possible the excommunication could be lifted sooner. How soon? That would depend on the RP and his supporters.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss reminds StoryHost Azrael, \\"Armband. Get rid of that, then he'll cooperate.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael admits to Master Zeiss, \\"I know nothing about an armband.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"And whether he chooses to cooperate or not, armband or not, sounds like an IC situation.\\"\\r\\nYou mention to Master Zeiss, \\"He can get rid of it. He can actively seek aid to get rid of it. Who was the one who pushed the ring on his finger?\\"\\r\\nYou tell StoryHost Azrael, \\"Cursed items sold by Barbora, a hedge witch who is known for seling cursed items.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael asks, \\"So he took a gamble, not knowing what the item did? Sounds IC... yeah...\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Since it was an IG thing he put that on, he got IG cursed, he has to IG cope with it.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss says, \\"Which I'm doing! \>_\<\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael asks, \\"What's the curse?\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss removes a khaki canvas Zeiss Company armband.\\r\\nAs Master Zeiss unsuccessfully attempts to remove Master Zeiss' sinister black crystal bound gold coiled armband, his upper arm turns a faint shade of glowing red and a look of indifference marks his face.\\r\\nMaster Zeiss tells StoryHost Azrael, \\"You attempt to remove the armband, but regardless of how you twist or turn it remains steadfastly upon your upper arm. No need to remove it anyway; the people who have wronged you deserve to pay.\\"\\r\\nYou suggest, \\"Find other ways, IG ways to remove it.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods, \\"Cool :)\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It is obviously cursed. It is not the first time that happened in the game. Others managed.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"IG.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"Yeah, sounds like an IC barrier to him being redeemed. But that's a plot to play though :)\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"Either with him getting revenge because of the curse, or with him trying to get it removed.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss says, \\"HIm trying to get it removed has born no fruit so far, and if you notice by the staff-made emit, he doesn't apparenty -want- to take it off, despite how much I've had him -try- to take it.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael reassures Master Zeiss, \\"Staff won't stop you from IC seeking to get it removed.\\"\\r\\nYou confirm, \\"It is possible. You can easily RP him having clear moments when he seeks to be rid of that thing. It might be interesting for him to have a struggling personality that fights witht he curse desparately trying to free himself from its effect and at times managing at times not managing.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss nods to StoryHost Azrael, \\"But playing according to the emit does, and when I was playing against the emit, there was no one who could take it off. The given hints didn't do anywhere. We tried max level jeweler, max levelblacksmith, max level armorer...\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss nods to you, \\"I've been doing the \\"moments of clarity\\" thing.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Then what stops you from finding ways to remove it in his clear moments?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Master Zeiss, \\"Other cursed items have been in the game, and been removed, so there are PCs that know. You can also now make use of the IC forums.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael tells Master Zeiss, \\"Or keep it forever, or longer-term, as a non-transient plot ;)\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss nods to StoryHost Azrael, \\"We already asked everyone who worked with the previous cursed items, and the methods used on them don't work on this one, apparently.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"And play Zeiss as the father figure, who is hard done by with the excommunication, but is still determined to show the city that he's turned over a new leaf.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss sighs.\\r\\nYou tell Master Zeiss, \\"I am sorry, but the first thing you have to do is to stop accusing others of Zeiss' IG actions. And stop using that accusation for justification to escape situations. I suggest you find IG ways to solve the issues.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss says, \\"No suggestions? Just \\"Deal with it\\"?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You say heros gang up on evils, yes, if you go murdering and get caught, heros will go after you. But if you have a good reputation or have powerful friends who are supporting you, then the heros will be stopped. If you do favors to those people, then they'll help. but you can not just expect them to help you. You have to start doing it yourself.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"That is my biggest suggestion to you.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"If you get stuck, we're happy to point you in possible directions. No guarantee our suggestions will work out, but we can at least give you ideas of things you might try.\\"\\r\\nYou point at StoryHost Azrael, \\"He and I both gve you advice how to deal with the armband. Such as find people faced similar fates, use the forums, in your clear moments try to find help, try to atone for the crimes he commited, or keep the armband as a constant feature, as long as you are willing to face the consequences.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods, \\"Yep, you could try sending scrolls to Zeiss' allies. Ask them to help him out, with the heroes ready to jump him. Ask them to lie on the crime testomony so he can't be arrested, or to help protect him if they try to arrest him, or to talk to their friends and ask their friends to not try arresting Zeiss. Or try to find some way to bribe or encourage Althalus to lift the bounty.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"(or perhaps even write to the constables or Althalus and offer to turn yourself in, with a request of them making the charge more minor than it is)\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss says, \\"Right, right.\\"\\r\\nYou ask Master Zeiss, \\"So what do you plan to do? Either some of these or instead walking your own path?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael notes, \\"Quite a few players have their PCs hide out in their rooms to avoid being arrested. And end up spending longer in their rooms than they'd spend in jail. And still get arrested after that.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael grins, \\"Heck, you could even team up with an IC friend, and have them turn Zeiss in for the bounty, so at least he can help out a friend.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss nods to StoryHost Azrael, \\"Yes, which is why I was RPing things such as taking a hostage, shouting through the door to try to strike a deal with the Constables, etc.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss says, \\"Instead of just \\"Hiding in his room\\", actually interacting with people.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods, \\"Cool, cool. As I said, I wasn't there, and haven't read the logs. But that sounds like you were on the right track.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael says, \\"So with your idea of pausing the game and taking it slower OOC, next time it might go better since you can explain to the other players what you're trying to do.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss nods to StoryHost Azrael, \\"Which I usually do try to do, I was just feeling a bit outnumbered and intimidated and had Zeiss make a run for it and grab a hostage on the way back...\\"\\r\\nYou ask Master Zeiss, \\"Is there anything you wish to talk about? Or add? Or discuss?\\"\\r\\nYou tell Master Zeiss, \\"But that's the point. He was outnumbered and intimidated thus should not have been able to run.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Being outnumbered MEANS you are not able to run. That is why you feel intimidated.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss says, \\"-I- felt it OoCly was the problem.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods, \\"But still a good idea to call a stop if you feel OOC outnumbered. And then can discuss where to go, with the IC outnumbering taken into account.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You were IG outnumbered, lured into an IG trap by IG people who responded to your IG actions. I do agree, that stopping OOC is a good idea.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss slowly nods, \\"Next time I'll try to stay a bit calmer...\\"\\r\\nYou thank Master Zeiss, \\"I appreciate it. Now, what chances will you give to people catching you while having your own chances to escape?\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss shrugs, \\"Depends on what we're willing to work with based on the current state of the scene, desired outcome, willingness of participants to cooperate, etc.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss mentions, \\"And while I'm thinking on things, I'd really prefer not to get involved with Madalina's player anymore, so I guess that would be a Guide issue?\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael nods, \\"Yep, guide issue. Just try to avoid her, although you can't really erase her from the gameworld or ignore her IC actions. If there is a problems, @assist and ask for a guide to help out.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Master Zeiss, \\"But then we are here, so you can pull that up right after we finished this issue. I would like you to give more chances to people. You pick the how, but I would like to see that you are not only hiding in your room only to sneak out when none is online and then go into the commons (which is populated even if PCs are not online)\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss reminds you, \\"The only way to get to anything in the gameworld except the boarding houses is to go through the common, so I'm kind of stuck on that particular facet...\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss says, \\"And I -have- been giving RP chances, as we stated...\\"\\r\\nYou tell Master Zeiss, \\"Let us not go back to where we started. I do not wish to repeat this talk over and over again. You are to give chances to others in the RP and not ignore the surroundings and don't leave if the situation makes you OOC frustrated. We can go over to Madalina now, if you wish. On that count, as I said, I will not wish to repeat this talk, so I expect that it takes the necessary effects. Fairness in the game -will- be ensured.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You can any time ask for staff help if you feel stuck or ooc cornered.\\"\\r\\nStoryHost Azrael comments randomly, \\"We enforce kindness with an iron fist!\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss laughs at StoryHost Azrael.\\r\\nYou giggle at StoryHost Azrael." \}) \}), ([ "warnings":1 ]) \}), "1271323195":(\{ "Using Ensign title when he isn't a guard", (\{ 16440 \}), (\{ (\{ "tonyd", 1271323195, "Opages faust to let him know that Ensign is a title intended for military pcs" \}) \}), ([  ]) \}), "1271325074":(\{ "Complain about being uncomfortable around zeiss", (\{ 16372 \}), (\{ (\{ "tonyd", 1271325074, "Told Clovers player that she is uncomfortable roleplaying with zeiss, yet continues to seek him out" \}) \}), ([  ]) \}), "1271326878":(\{ "A question from hush about a sexual scene with Zeiss", (\{ 15571 \}), (\{ (\{ "tonyd", 1271326878, "Zeiss kissed hush against her will.

An RP ban or just avoiding one another characters and seeing where that goes?\\"\\r\\nFergie chitters to you, \\"I'm fine with either.\\"\\r\\nFergie defers to Master Zeiss.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou mention to Master Zeiss aside, \\"If you really invaded someone's space real life, that can't be compared to whether someone told you what their character would be doing OOC. Not that we encourage that type of OOC conversation anyway. As I said, this isn't really a game related issue, but you should look at your own actions perhaps. You asked to find out what you did to upset another player. Now you've been told.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss shrugs at you, \\"I feel the complaint is ungrounded and the response is unfair, but you're right about there being nothing to be done about that and it not being an ICO issue... It ruins most of the game for me, but again, can't force someone to RP with someone they don't want to.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss shrugs again, \\"She gets what she wants either way, so why bother with a ban? Not like we'll ever be RPing with each other again anyway.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou nod to Master Zeiss, \\"All I can really address is the game related issues and ask if players want OOC mediation. In this case she doesn't. That leaves the game related issues.\\"\\r\\nMaster Zeiss nods to you, \\"M-hm. Well, at least I guess I at least know -WHY- now. That's something...\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nYou nod, \\"Very well, then informally I suggest you avoid RP with one another's characters for a while, but we won't institute a ban on all RP. If the situation continues to fester, please continue to @assist.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Perhaps over time RP will naturally evolve again as OOC tensions diminish.

The player is using information from at least one other \\r\\nplayer who has identified me through certain \\"tells\\", and, thinking I \\r\\ncould trust the second player (plays Ruggero, Ranulf), I allowed him to \\r\\nknow who I have played in other games.  I've asked both players to keep \\r\\nthings to OOC, as I'm here on ICO to play a game, to create a story, and \\r\\nto play out the storyline presented to me as best I can under the \\r\\ncircumstances.  Nonetheless, it has been revealed to me in OOC \\r\\n[Type @cont to continue reading; @cont all to read the rest.] (40)\\r\\n\> @cont\\r\\nconversations that Phillip's player deliberately hunted me down in CM and \\r\\nhas actively created characters to interact with Alkmene in ICO.  I was \\r\\nflattered, at first, thinking that it was a compliment of my RPing \\r\\nabilities; but it has consistently become increasingly aggravating and \\r\\naggressive, with very strange RP situations arising that feel very much \\r\\nlike IG harrassment of Alkmene, and that have caused me to even consider \\r\\nleaving the game again... and certainly to pull back from ANY RP \\r\\ninteraction with the characters she plays (she has confirmed that she is a \\r\\nfemale, IRL).  There is too much that I enjoy about playing ICO to want to \\r\\nleave, truly; and too many good RPers here; and I honestly adore the staff \\r\\nin this game most of all.  The environment is far more suited to my RP \\r\\nstyle, and I have many, many ideas that I would like to contribute to \\r\\nmaking the game more fun and interesting for everyone.  I have tried \\r\\neverything I can to manage this situation, and I am finally at my wits' \\r\\nend:  either I must take a break from the game, despite my wishes, or I \\r\\nmust report this with the hopes that someone can help me to deal with this \\r\\naggressive player.  I have kept logs of my interactions with both players \\r\\nwhile playing both ICO and CM; and I have honestly weighed my options \\r\\nrepeatedly.  Nonetheless, I believe in the staff here; I believe in the \\r\\nplayers, by and large; and I believe in the value of this game for myself \\r\\nand others with whom I would very deeply like to share it.  Please get in \\r\\ntouch with me at your leisure and I will be happy to discuss this \\r\\nsituation more in depth.

I' tried to work things out but its gotten to the point. I can't play with him anymore. I don't need a mediator. I just prefer not to play with the player.I can easily get the paternity changed because I had suggested a plot involving that with the other person she was involved in. Yes. Understand that this is like alot of drama and all that stuff, but I'm human and I want to not play with this person that I'm connected to with a marriage certificate.

Basically personal issues, I need to avoid interacting with the player. Game wise- Rion has a backstory and I created her to rp with him. Yet, he barely gets on and as other characters I have messaged his alts to get him to play and he'll say later maybe. So I wait as long as I can and by the end when he does get on, I'm tired or don't feel like rping that much. Yes, Dieter is not his main, but if you are building a story with someone, especially one that involves marriage, a backstory like theirs and stuff, make efforts to rp with the person. We never really have had quality rp because of these feelings behind the being pushed into it. She's found interest in game in a complicated relationship and all. I joked around with the other player(not Dieter's player) about the pregnancy plot thing and them being the father. being she's having twins I suggested it again and we asked azrael and azrael told me to give an assist to you guys. I had not honestly told diet'er player because I don't have to really its my choice how I play my characters. Well, he got made with topsy saying she'd feel more comfortable for me to tell him and get him to assist with an okay. This led to other issues and stuff and I've come to the conclusion that I need to cut ties with him completely. I know that with the other player already okaying that one of the babies is his kid, he'd be fine with the other one being his kid too. I'll pay the props when it comes time.

Even if she feels she's justified to go after this one person on multiple characters, the rule is you pick one character to seek blood and the others just drop their grievances.\\"\\r\\nLord Ruggero says, \\"Yeah, well, it seems she's gonna use whatever she can cause she feels its right.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I'll have to talk to the other involved to get a broader picture of what's going on.\\"\\r\\nLord Ruggero says, \\"heck, she has two people who are rinaldi basically, Iphy and Giorgia.\\"\\r\\nLord Ruggero says, \\"A dame and the mother of a Count.\\"\\r\\nLord Ruggero says, \\"Plus whatever influence she's using on new people in the fold, like Calypso.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"In the meantime, continue to avoid her. If she continues to try to engage in roleplay with you, save a log of the interaction.\\"\\r\\nLord Ruggero says, \\"Yeah, I'll be taking screenshots or something. I keep politely avoiding, but..\\"\\r\\nLord Ruggero says, \\"Supposedly Bjorn's player told her ooc'ly to calm down too.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Has she been talking shit oocly too?\\"\\r\\nLord Ruggero says, \\"I don't know, I wouldn't be surprised.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Alright, I'll talk to them.\\"\\r\\nLord Ruggero says, \\"Meepers might know, along with Orla, or Maddy.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Should probably just talk to the people who know for sure.\\"\\r\\nLord Ruggero says, \\"Well, Maddy was there for some of it, saw Faith trashing Rug.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Is there anything else I should make note of?\\"\\r\\nLord Ruggero says, \\"Lidia told Iphy to stop the attacks IC'ly, I believe.\\"\\r\\nLord Ruggero says, \\"I don't know. She can try and spin this however she likes, but it seems to be that she has to be the one victimised and get her constant revenge.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It might be irrelevant but why did they break up?\\"\\r\\nLord Ruggero says, \\"Really, because she kept accusing Ruggero of the same thing, after he apologized.\\"\\r\\nLord Ruggero says, \\"And after three days, and dealing with her abuse with different characters of mine, I'm done with her. I can't deal with her like this.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And what does Faith have against Ruggero?\\"\\r\\nLord Ruggero says, \\"They were together a long time back, he was to help her reach rank and they'd court. She decided Ruggero wasn't paying enough attention to her and ran off with someone else. He said \\"Ok fine.\\"\\r\\nLord Ruggero says, \\"If you want to pull Morven up, she's ok with it.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Alright, I'll send you back and bring her up.\\"\\r\\nLord Ruggero says, \\"Ok.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Don't forget to screenshot if anything else happens.\\"\\r\\nSending Lord Ruggero to the ground floor, northern guestroom of the Gilded Balance Inn.\\r\\nLord Ruggero leaves.\\r\\n\\r\\n[OOC Page] to [Chindora/Morven]: \\"Heya. Mind if I bring you up for a chat?\\"\\r\\n[OOC Page] from [Chindora/Morven]: \\"I am just hanging out with the plants\\"\\r\\nMorven arrives.\\r\\nYou wave, \\"Heya.\\"\\r\\nMorven waves.\\r\\nYou say, \\"Ruggero's player seems to have some concerns regarding the player of Iphigenia. And said you might have witnessed some of the questionable behavior.\\"\\r\\nMorven shrugs, \\"Yes, well, she has been very persistent lately, using different characters to create tension and drama where there should not be stuff going on...but she is in general a very reactionary player, and always seems to be on the defensive, regardless of what people say or do.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Of course we don't want to see anyone get into trouble but we do have an obligation to protect our players from harassment.\\"\\r\\nYou ask Morven, \\"Has she given any indication that the behavior is motivated by OOC feelings?\\"\\r\\nMorven nods, \\"I agree 100%. It seems that everywhere I turn, there she is, with one of her I do not know how many characters, and she is creating situations that I think she is trying to cause problems for Scott...\\"\\r\\nMorven tells you, \\"The thing of it is that she seems very hostile, with enough of her characters, that it bothers me, makes me uncomfortable.\\"\\r\\nMorven explains to you, \\"This morning just really bothered me.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"What happened this morning?\\"\\r\\nMorven tells you, \\"We (Valeria and I) walked into the lobbyof the inn, and this cat was sitting in Ruggero's lap. Now, immediately, I was suspicious, because I mean, who does that? Goes into a new town, not know anyone, and then hop into the lap of one of the highest nobles in town, right?\\"\\r\\nMorven continues, \\"So, Morven let Ruggs know, obliquely, that the behaviour was not appropriate, especially in light of his recent troubles, and he was like....oh, right, well she has different customs in her land. And morven said, \\"Well, if I ignored local customs when I go to Akoma, I could be kidnapped and sold into slavery before anyone notices I am missing....so she needs to respect our customs...\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"And so, Ruggero told her that Morven was right, she needed to hop up, and so then she started getting mad, throwing a fit, saying blah, blah, and then about that time, Valeria noticed that she had a knife in her hand.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Granted, it was a carving knife, but still.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"So, Valeria calmly rested her hand on her rapier hilt, and eyeballed the carving knife, at which point, Renesme got very hostile about Valeria, and told her she did not like being looked at like that....so Valeria pointed out that having an unsheathed blade so close to a noble was probably not a wise idea.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Then Renesme got very angry, said she did not like being accused of being a criminal, and stalked out. She promptly went down to the commons, and started trying to cause trouble down there about this.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Meanwhile, back in the Inn, Morven was calmly reminding Ruggero that he could not afford to even have a whiff of rumour tainting him at this time, that Kilana could and would punish him further if she felt it necessary....and I was OOC warning Scott about this, and I had told him that I thought this was Lana...he did not believe me at first, but then, he did. He felt that she had tried to rope him into something that would cause problems for him if Kilana or anyone else found out.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"So....I warned him further, strongly suggested he avoid this situation. I reminded him of the problems he had been having and suggested that he be penitent and humble, and not be alone with female characters, and not have strange cats in his lap, that it just looked bad.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And you're sure Renesme = Lana?\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Absolutely, yes. She revealed herself to Veronica, at the Western Commons, apologized to her OOC about some drama between them.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Madalina's player.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"So, yeah, because Maddy paged me and said \\"She has another.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Okay.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"I thought she meant that Maddy had recruited another sailor.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"So, then she explained what she meant, and I was like.....OK.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"So, again, I warned Scott, as did Veronica, that this was Iffy, er, Lana.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Btw, revealing alts is a no-no. Even if Lana told Madalina, it's against ToS for Madalina to share that information with anyone else.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Sorry, I guess she was trying to be helpful and warn me, or warn Scott.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I mean, I get it... friends want to protect friends.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"There has been so much going on with her, such hostiity....and even my husband, who Lana knows is my husband, but nobody else in game does....other than Cosmo, I mean, y'all....\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Brian talks to Lana a bit, he is friendly, but we are both against this whole atmosphere of TS, because we feel that it causes problems in the player base. We both tell all of our interactive chars that we do not do TS so they know that up front, no chance.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"So, he and Lana....\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I'm not going to focus on the violation of ToS in this case... I mean, it's not right and in future instances, I would prefer players tell staff immediately if they suspect harassing behavior rather than spread that info via ooc chatlines. So that's all I'll say about it.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Today she was crying to him about how angry she was that Ruggero did not protect her from Valeria and Morven's attacks. To begin with, I have logs, Valeria has logs, there was NO attack, period.\\"\\r\\nOOC -- Morven says, \\"Thank you.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"So, Brian....\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"He talked to her for a long time about this, told her to be a bug on the ceiling and consider it from that angle. He is a teacher, he is really good at getting people to think how he wants them to.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"So, he explained to her the idea that she was a new character, with a knife, and the deal about the noble, the lap, etc., and gave her several ideas for different ways to go forward, none of which involved her creating unnecessary drama. He also reminded her that Ruggero was very vulnerable right now, and did not need any sort of extra trouble.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"So he thought he had succeeded in some small measure.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Half an hour later, she was in the merchant circle, and was hitting up Ruggero.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"And she went up to him and was whispering that she wanted to see him again....so Ruggero, having at least two brain cells that were functioning, told her that it was not polite to whisper in public, and he told her that he was not interested in seeing her, that he was trying to stay out of situations tha tmight cause problems for himself....\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"And at that exact moment, Kilana walked in, and saw his response to Renesme.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Kilana's player is the one who suggested that he file an assist....not only because of that, but also because of how Iphigenia has been behaving.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I can understand how Brian must have been feeling.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"To tell you the truth, I do not know what the deal is there. I just know that I want a player base that has more cohesion, without the ooc back stabbing drama. It is difficult, because I lose track of Lana's characters. I do not know how many she has but she is very easy to spot because her characters tend to have similar attitudes and mannerisms.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Between you and me, I can't tell you how many hours of discussions we have had with this person about this exact type of behavior.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"I never had a problem with her, aside from this drama....she has never tried to hurt me, or any of my characters.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"I can only imagine. I think that it is tough for Scott, because he is trying to get smarter, and make better choices, but she makes it very difficult for him. She intentionally goads him and pushes him in ways that she knows will provoke a response. My advice was to just absent himself from a situation if she was there.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Has Brian ever felt... maybe not stalked, but often pursued by her and/or her characters?\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Absolutely. She has done things like wait outside his door.\\"\\r\\nYou say to Morven, \\"And it's hard to avoid someone when they have a dozen characters that you may not know about.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"But, he handles it.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"He may know how to handle it but most people don't. Some may be fine with the roleplay. At first.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"We try to handle our business ourselves, without involving staff. We know how busy you guys are with stuff that matters. He is a very calm, very level headed guy, and we both have many years of RP experience, whether here, LARP, or tabletop, so we tend to try to deal with stuff IC.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"So, one thing she does is have a character on in the market corner.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"We appreciate that. Don't be afraid to call on us though if things get too weird or if you suspect someone is being a parasite. You might avoid the plague but others are vulnerable.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"And if she sees a person come through that she wants to spend time with, the other character magically comes on, and follows the person who was trying to avoid her.\\"\\r\\nMorven nods.\\r\\nYou frown.\\r\\nMorven says, \\"She is really bad about the male characters she interacts with. Morven is friends with Trevyn, and Isabella is \\"seeing\\" him. If Morven and Trevyn are talking, and one of her alts sees it, she drags isabella out and comes to find them.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"She has done this twice in the past couple of days, once with Isabella with Trevyn and Morven, and once with Faith and Adon and Morven.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Does she try to drag them away from RP or just.. hovers?\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"And Morven ain't got no time for romancing any of these guys, they are just friends.\\"\\r\\nYou nod understandingly.\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Well, she hangs around, making it obvious that Morven is intruding on her turf, doing subtle things, and so ultimately, either Morven leaves, or they do, and I know that will happen.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"So, Adon digs plants, as does Morven.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Trevyn is a wolf, in the Dolo, and Morven used to be engaged to a Dolo Baronet, a thousand years ago or so, and Morven started talking to Trevyn because, wolf thing.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Nothing else going on anywhere. I get told that Morven is seen as a goody two shoes.\\"\\r\\nMorven smirks.\\r\\nYou say, \\"Even if she macking on them, she shouldn't be trying to break up the roleplay.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"She as in Faith/Isabella/etc.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"She keeps trying to convince Bjorn to have a baby together, to get married, blah blah, and he is just like....girl, you move too fast for this slow moving elk dude.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"right.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Good lord.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Neither of us, none of us, is interested in that kind of RP, but we do FTB, which is what I always did in CM.\\"\\r\\nYou nod.\\r\\nMorven says, \\"But, hahahahahahahaha, Bjorn is even more goody two shoes than Morven, and he won't touch Evie, which annoys her....she wants a baby, one way or the other....I have had five, thank you, not in a rush to RP that for anyone.\\"\\r\\nYou laugh.\\r\\nMorven grins.\\r\\nYou say, \\"My girlfriend and I have zero interest in that type of RP too. Unless it's with each other. It's annoying when people are persistent.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Can I ask you something possibly unrelated?\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Engineer, Surgeon, Physicist, Business Major in college, and of course, my harpist, who, btw, is going to the Royal College of Music in London next year. I love my kids, very, very proud of them...but no babies in ICO for me.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"sure.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Your kids sound amazing :) You guys did good.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"They are strong, creative, and kind. That is what matters.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I used to staff LC many years ago. I know she has recently taken the reins and it seems the majority of her new staff were recruited from ICO.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I don't mind that at all. I would love for LC to thrive again.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Oy. Yes. I offered to help with being a referee or story nanny.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"argh, one sec... ma is calling.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"You answer the phone when your mom calls??? I need to tell my youngest son that.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I do. I love my ma!\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Oh, my boys love me, but they are so busy.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"BTW, Veronica has screen shots from when Renesme was harassing Ruggero earlier. Not sure if you want that.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"But what I wanted to ask... do you get the impression she might abuse her position as LC staff?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Any and all screenshots would be helpful :)\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"I have been concerned about that, if only because of her behaviour here.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I don't want her to use her position as leverage to force people to RP with her or tolerate her behavior.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"I see a pattern of unhealthy behaviour that is disturbing to me, almost like an obsession...\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Well, she has a huge thing with TS, according to what I have heard. She expects it. And, if not, then she loses interest, and wanders her characters off...only bringing them on when necessary, because she is too busy doing the nasty with a character that will indulge her.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"I am sorry, it just kinda creeps me out, but that is me. I am not a prude, but....someone who is not as good at just saying \\"Yeah, this ain't my bag, baby,\\" might feel coerced into that sort of thing.\\"\\r\\nMorven shrugs, \\"Like I said, not a fan, because people tend to get their emotions from RL too entwined with their IC stuff, and then the well is poisoned.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"So, I do not know, is the answer, but I can definitely keep an eye on it. I have found it very hard to get her to move forward on anything, but she may just not be that worried about giving me a position that basically does not help her out much. I know she is more interested in builders, because LC is in desperate need.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I've been popping in once in awhile to kind of help out but I can't get too involved. That's why I asked.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I also feel an obligation, that if she is abusing her power, to reach out to Shannon.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Heck, if she is harassing people, I still feel an obligation to let him know about it.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"I honestly do not ever see anyone in there to even RP with....very seldom do I cross paths with another Character. Brian is working on some stuff with LC, mapping, I think.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I noticed him online the other day. He was afk.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I think it's great people are interested in helping.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Yeah, he works from home, except when his classes are in session.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"I am so ready for him to go back to sea....\\"\\r\\nMorven laughs.\\r\\nYou laugh.\\r\\nYou say, \\"If I do have to take this to Shannon, would you guys be willing to submit statements?\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Yeah, I would, if only because....as a survivor of abuse, I can assure you, that if someone does not stop an abuser, they will continue to prey on others. Someone has to be the chain breaker. I would MUCH rather see her rehabilitated, and become a more productive, if less invasive, member of the community....but it may not be possible.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"How is it possible that she has so many characters that are so deeply involved in so many areas of ICO?\\"\\r\\nchange? How many people will get fed up and quit?\\r\\nYou say, \\"Having dealt with these types of issues for several years, the worst thing we can do is continue to hope for rehabilitation. How many people are going to suffer while we remain hopeful for change? How many people will get fed up and quit?\\"\\r\\nMorven nods.\\r\\nYou say, \\"Sometimes victims will step forward to tell us but more often than not, they just log out and never come back.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"I know.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Premium accounts get 5 characters. If you have two premium accounts, that's 10 characters.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"There are no rules against having multiple accounts. You just have to follow the alt rules.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Scott is afraid to turn around, because he keeps bumping into her one place or another. Her Giorgia found him in the inn tonight, started sweetying him and so on, and he got up and moved.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Oh, I see....well, then.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It's not fair to say to Scott \\"Just stay away from her\\" when he doesn't know where she is. That's can't be fun for him to wonder about every person he encounters.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"That*\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"It is not at all, and he has thought about deleting his account, but I keep giving him alternative approaches.\\"\\r\\nYou sigh, \\"It sounds like staff has a lot to discuss. I know what we need to do as far as ICO goes but I'm having a moral dilemma about whether or not to take this problem to Shannon.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"I am sorry. I know that is a heavy burden.\\"\\r\\nMorven says, \\"Let me know if I can help in any way.

Could the opposite not\\r\\njust as easily occur?\\"\\"\\r\\n\> 05:05 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"This was ignored and she tried to leave but\\r\\nBrenner unsubtly stopped her. She asked why, and he said: later I deal with\\r\\nyou.\\"\\r\\n\> Elizabeth tells you, \\"She'd displayed ungrateful behavior toward the House\\r\\nas whole, in general, because she has not been freed immediately. At one\\r\\npoint she said something about how she was upset to see that the House would\\r\\nlet one of their own be in slavery for so long, or something along those\\r\\nlines.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:06 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"Meerclar: I just don't get how they can justify\\r\\nbeing so MEAN to Caliste (exactly like they were to Ryan when he was also a\\r\\nslave of their house) but they're all so nice to Lia, who is a Dolo slave.\\"\\r\\n\> Elizabeth swishes her long fuzzy tail, \\"It upset the members, because they\\r\\nexplained to her it takes time to restore someone to Gentry again, and as of\\r\\nlate, she had not been displaying behavior of a slave that -wanted- to be\\r\\nfreed.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:06 [LocalGame\|Nyx] \\"I was trying to explain that rosters are really OOC\\r\\ninformation. If I hire someone to work for me, and pay them money, but they\\r\\ntake no oaths to my house formally then they are not formally in the House.\\r\\nThat is IG accurate. Just because they get lessons from a teacher and are\\r\\nlisted on a roster doesn't make them oath-bound to anyone\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad asks Elizabeth, \\"Do you happen to have a log of the\\r\\nconversation we cuold read?\\"\\r\\n\> Elizabeth shakes her head, \\"I don't, but one of the others who was present\\r\\nmight.\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad asks Elizabeth, \\"What type of chances do you offer\\r\\nfor her to RP with you and others in the house or outside of it?\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad says, \\"How do you include her in the RP or the life\\r\\nof the house?\\"\\r\\n\> 05:08 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"Meerclar: They did the same thing to Ryan when\\r\\nhe was a Avoir slave, Nyx. I eventually left the house because they had\\r\\nbasically told all the house members not to talk to him, and had banned him\\r\\nfrom talking to the other house slaves, and sent him away distrustfully\\r\\nevery time he was in the room.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:09 [LocalGame\|Nyx] \\"Yep, that's how it is. I actually scan areas before\\r\\ngoing in now to avoid them because I know all they'll do is make me feel\\r\\nlike crap\\"\\r\\n\> Elizabeth tells StoryPlotter Sirazad, \\"Caliste and Liz don't often see\\r\\neach other, but when they do, Liz asks how she is,  and tries to strike up a\\r\\nconversation with her.\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad hrms unrelatedly, \\"Being freed is 3 tokens, being a\\r\\ngentry is another 4. It is not the same. However the house already freed a\\r\\nhorse, just because he was a horse, and he was getting in trouble and into\\r\\nslavery on his own account not as a war captive.\\"\\r\\n\> Elizabeth blinks at StoryPlotter Sirazad's words, \\"Huh. I didn't know\\r\\nthat.\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad admits, \\"What I see from where I am is that Lia is\\r\\nthe only slave the Avoirdupois Rp with. The other slaves are simply sent\\r\\naway or said to be silent. ANd those are the events my characters have\\r\\nobserved in various passing moments. As well as other charactes being\\r\\nconstantly ignored by emitting ignore, ignore always, ignore again.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:11 [LocalGame\|Nyx] \\"I -really- want them to be fair. I OOC want her to\\r\\ngo to someone else because of the problems, but IC they are the only chance\\r\\nCaliste has to get freed really, so I feel forced to stay there. How do I\\r\\nmake the plot progress any other way? How do I make it progress at all for\\r\\nthat matter?\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad says, \\"Which as I have mentioned before can only lead\\r\\nto a spiral of ignoreing more till the my father can ignore better then your\\r\\nfather comes into play, which makes everyone, even unrelated people\\r\\nuncomfortable.\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad says, \\"And that is a concern, because the Avoirdupois\\r\\nis a VP guild.\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad says, \\"Which means they get extra things and for that\\r\\nthey are expected to be inclusive. Just like all VP guilds.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:12 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"Meerclar: Seriously, do they not know that so\\r\\nmany other players avoid involving them in plots and things because of how\\r\\nthey act?\\"\\r\\n\> 05:12 [LocalGame\|Nyx] \\"I don't think so because they all involve each\\r\\nother. They're probably perfectly happy in their bubble\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad says, \\"Can you think on ways that is more inclusive\\r\\nthen telling a slave not to talk with someone? I mean, yes, you can tell\\r\\nthem no tto talk with someone, but then you have to give something in\\r\\nreturn, right? So the PLAYER has RP.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:13 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"Meerclar: Yeah. I guess. I have noticed that\\r\\nthey seem pretty happy with it, but as Sira says, it's a vp guild. They\\r\\nshouldn't be using the avoir for this.\\"\\r\\n\> Elizabeth nods understandingly, \\"Right, I can see how that can happen. I\\r\\nthink what it is is  that sometimes we, probably as players, aren't sure\\r\\nwhat to do with a slaves like Caliste or Marcel, because we're not sure how\\r\\nto respond in a way that won't upset others. Then the ignoring happens, and\\r\\nthat's just backwards.\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad admits, \\"i am only talking about events I saw or read\\r\\nabout in logs. Not about events that I haven't witnessed in any shape. It is\\r\\nok to ignore someone, but really think about where such RP leads. To you or\\r\\nothers.\\"\\r\\n\> Elizabeth explains, \\"With Marcel, it was -extremely- difficult to find an\\r\\nIC median, because the player almost always got upset with any IC\\r\\nconsequence, and they Avos were really lenient with him, especially with all\\r\\nthe trouble he caused them. I think we're all just sort of tentative now\\r\\nbecause we had one slave/player who did this, and now we're afraid it will\\r\\nrepeat itself.\\"\\r\\n\> StoryGuide Meerclar says, \\"Perhaps talking OOC to the players of the\\r\\nslaves would help to find a way to positively interact?\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad admits, \\"I am not only talking about Caliste, but\\r\\nagain, general observation. A lot of whispers, and dragging people off, a\\r\\nlot of ignoring going on, a lot of sending people away. Which is causing\\r\\ndistress with people who feel you exclude them. I understand you might not\\r\\nhave noticed or considered that side, and I am not here to point fingers or\\r\\nchew your leg off. However it is our goal to remedy the situation. Together\\r\\nwith you. So I wuold love to hear ideas on how you think it could be helped\\r\\nwhile staying true to your characters.\\"\\r\\n\> Elizabeth nods to StoryGuide Meerclar, \\"I would have, but I was never\\r\\napproached by a player, so I didn't know that is how they felt.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:16 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"Meerclar: Especially since they just seem to be\\r\\npromoting within' their little circle. They wanted to give one token to\\r\\nelizabeth and two to brenner,,.....and none to caliste, who has been waiting\\r\\nfor -how- long now to be free?\\"\\r\\n\> StoryGuide Meerclar says, \\"But if you, as a player aren't sure about how\\r\\nto react to another character, then surely starting a conversation OOC to\\r\\nfind a solution would be better than feeling unsure about how to proceed or\\r\\nreact?\\"\\r\\n\> 05:17 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"It is time to give out promotion tokens though,\\r\\nno? When did we last give them out?\\"\\r\\n\> Elizabeth yips, \\"I think I've been a bit hesitant with that, because the\\r\\nexperience with Marcel was so bad IC and OOC, I'm just kind withdrawn.\\"\\r\\n\> You say, \\"Ideally I would prefer a\\r\\ngame where ignoring characters was a last resort, only to avoid rp that you\\r\\njust can't stand, and there is no other way to fix the situation, and that\\r\\nincludes having had staff mediate for you and the person you feel you have\\r\\nto ignore.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:18 [LocalGame\|Nyx] \\"It should be time, or close to it\\"\\r\\n\> 05:18 [LocalGame\|Nyx] \\"In game? I think I made her a year ago.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:18 [LocalGame\|Nyx] \\"Which I don't mind being patient. I would wait\\r\\nyears and years if I saw it going anywhere at all\\"\\r\\n\> 05:19 [LocalGame\|Nyx] \\"It just isn't. Faye was the closest person to\\r\\nreacting at all, and she left already\\"\\r\\nStoryPlotter Sirazad smiles at Elizabeth, \\"When such issues come, you can\\r\\ncontact us. We can help with mediating or consulting. We aren't here only to\\r\\njump in when we see trouble but also for guidance and help. So if you seek\\r\\ngeneral plot advice on how to handle or include someone you are not familiar\\r\\nwith or you don't know how to address the situation, then feel free to talk\\r\\nwith us.\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad says, \\"Is there any situation or are there situations\\r\\nthat fall in that category? Now might be a good time to list them and find\\r\\nsolutions for them.\\"\\r\\n\> You remind Elizabeth, \\"If you feel you\\r\\ncan't talk to a player about something, and you are concerned, please\\r\\nassist.\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad agrees with you wholeheartedly, \\"Ignoring on a\\r\\nconstant basis equals to say: I don't want to RP with you and I give you no\\r\\nroom to respond but to hate me.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:20 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"She got passive. This is going nowhere.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:21 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"Meerclar: So what now? We offer some solutions\\r\\nthat we need her to follow?\\"\\r\\n\> 05:22 [LocalGame\|Nyx] \\"I think it's funny Brenner said he's trying to get\\r\\nCaliste away from Flynn. She hasn't even mentioned being worried about Flynn\\r\\nto anyone. That's like .. the last thing they should be worrying about.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:22 [LocalGame\|Nyx] \\"Just tell her you're taking away the slave?\\"\\r\\n\> 05:22 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"Meerclar: Yup. We can do that :)\\"\\r\\nElizabeth nods, \\"Yeah, that's true.\\r\\nI think we ended up doing that with Marcel because we were all pretty much\\r\\nfrustrated with that whole area. Other than that, personally, I can't really\\r\\nthink of a situation because I don't realize I've done it.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:22 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"how about I say this? \\"Basically, I\\r\\ndon't want you to ignore, or role play ignoring anyone, unless you have\\r\\nstaff ok to do so.  In other words, staff have tried to help you to resolve\\r\\nthe situation, and it hasn't worked.  Only then you can ignore people.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:22 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"I guess a guide just has a friendly chat to the\\r\\nproblems, and asks what sort of a relationship they want with Caliste, and\\r\\ntalks about ways to involve her in the RP without excluding or telling her\\r\\nto shut up. And reminds them that they need to do that to keep her in the\\r\\nhouse, or she'd be given a new master (and it's OK if they want her to have\\r\\na new master)\\"\\r\\n\> 05:22 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I would be stricter. This is a VP guild, they\\r\\nare to be inclusive. I want to see that happen. It is a general problem,\\r\\nthat always reoccures, but yes, we can agree that the slve is to be taken\\r\\naway.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:22 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"Or if Nyx wants it, just take away the slave\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad nods to Elizabeth, \\"Then how do you think you could\\r\\neven be -more- inclusive? I can help with a few guidelines which might be\\r\\nbest kept in mind, especially because you are in a leading position in a VP\\r\\nguild.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:23 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"Meerclar: We've talked to this player before\\r\\nabout ignoring people. She has had warnings\\"\\r\\n\> 05:23 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"And yes, telling them they aren't allowed to\\r\\nignore people is probably wise :) Assuming you guys are willing to police\\r\\nthat.\\"\\r\\n\> +lg 'what I said is pretty strict right?05:23 [LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha]\\r\\n\\"what I said is pretty strict right?\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad says, \\"First of all, less whispering. Way less\\r\\nwhispering. I believe dragging people away is not the best sort to include\\r\\npeople.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:23 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"And I've got no problem with saying that players\\r\\nwho ignore others can't be in, or benefit from, VP guilds\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad says, \\"Being in public places and addressing people\\r\\nwho come and go is a good thing, it gives them chances to RP. Only whisper\\r\\nin the process what must be. Don't be afraid to be overheard at time, it\\r\\ncreates RP for you and others. And it is how you can include people.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:24 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"Meerclar: I totally agree with that. VP guilds\\r\\nneed to be inclusive, or they're just another guild with benefits\\"\\r\\n\> Elizabeth admits however, \\"I have noticed that the House as whole has been\\r\\nkind of shutting out, and I want to try to work on that, so I've had Liz try\\r\\nto talk to more people. And I do try to cut down on the whispering, so if\\r\\nsomeone whispers to Liz, I try to have her respond out loud, either quietly,\\r\\nor whatever.\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad says, \\"Less ignoring people. And try to find tasks\\r\\nyou give to those in the house, so they have RP.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:24 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"Lmao, what a lie :)\\"\\r\\n[LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"Flynn hasn't even SEEN Brenner since he came\\r\\nback, wtf?\\"\\r\\n\> 05:25 [LocalGame\|Nyx] \\"I dunno\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad apologises to Elizabeth, \\"It is not visible though.\\r\\nEvery time I read a log (even if it is not about Elizabeth, but something\\r\\nelse) I only see Elizabeht whispering.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:25 [LocalGame\|Nyx] \\"I'd rather just be taken away. I don't want to have\\r\\nto deal with them being upset OOC now (which they will be, they are them)\\"\\r\\n\> StoryGuide Meerclar nods to Elizabeth, \\"It's a good idea to be more\\r\\ninclusive, because in turn people wil include you more. I have noticed that\\r\\na lot of people don't bother to uinclude the Avoir house in things when\\r\\ninvolving other people because they so often feel shut out by the house.\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad smiles at Elizabeth, \\"unfortunately it is an issue. I\\r\\nwould like to see real changes in that. It will help your own experiences as\\r\\nwell.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:26 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"We can take Caliste away, AND deal with them not\\r\\nbeing inclusive\\"\\r\\n[LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"ok, we will take the slave as well, its cool,\\r\\nbut I want the other excluding issues dealt with as well, which they are,\\r\\nthanks Sira\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad nods, \\"Yes, we had many complaints about the\\r\\nAvoirdupois. We understand that it is difficult with the house as they do\\r\\nhave certain traits that might make them appear arrogant and distant. But\\r\\neven if you are distant, you can talk. You know, whatever, about the\\r\\nweather. Or about telling someone to arrange for a scarf for the other house\\r\\nmember, or finding a teacher, or asking about nobles and maybe plotting\\r\\nagainst the Doloreaux. You can dislike someone, but still include the person\\r\\nyou IG dislike.\\"\\r\\n\> Elizabeth nods, \\"All right. I've just started to notice how it's getting\\r\\nto be, so I'm getting into that fix-it-gear already. It's kind of tough,\\r\\nbecause some of the other Avos don't want to break from that circle, I\\r\\nthink.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:27 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"Meerclar: I like the solution of not giving them\\r\\npromotion tokens unless they stop being exclusive\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad smiles at Elizabeth, \\"I don't want you to feel\\r\\nsingled out. We will consult with others in the house, mostly because it is\\r\\na VP guild with higher expectations from staff. After all you get items\\r\\nimported and promotion tokens and plots specially for you.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:28 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"And I have no problem removing players who have\\r\\nbeen warned about being exclusive if they continue to do so from the VP\\r\\nguilds\\"\\r\\n\> grin at elizabeth \\"We'll talk to the others as well, and it is something\\r\\nyou will all need to work on together. You grin at Elizabeth, \\"We'll talk to\\r\\nthe others as well, and it is something you will all need to work on\\r\\ntogether.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:29 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"We've done that with PCs in the sailors guild\\r\\nalready\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad says, \\"Which guilds don't. And for that we expect the\\r\\nhouses to be true to the original concept of the houses (though we don't\\r\\nexpect -all- members to be) and to be very inclusive and proactive.\\"\\r\\n\> Elizabeth admits to StoryPlotter Sirazad, \\"Liz has noticed it IC, too, and\\r\\nshe/I'm trying to get stuff going better that way. That in itself is hard,\\r\\nbecause the members keep popping and out randomly and so-on. I suspect we'll\\r\\nhave more members showing up after Finals and Christmas/New Years, though.\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad says, \\"IG Chalon sent people here to promote the\\r\\nhouse.

You know what we are\\r\\nexpecting and what we hope to see. We have given some hints what need to be\\r\\nchanged and how. We understand it is a lot of work too.

Who's doing what?\\"\\r\\n\> Elizabeth adds, \\"Lia and Liz have definitely had their spats too. I know\\r\\nMat and Lia are really close, ICly, and maybe she and Brenner are somewhat\\r\\nclose.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:34 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"Did you want Flynn to take Caliste away? And\\r\\nshould we wait until Nyx finds a new PC she wants as a master (or Ryan or\\r\\nFlynn could possibly sell her) - the Doloreaux are also becoming more active\\r\\nagain, so that might be a good option. And who from the Avoi needs to be\\r\\nspoken with, and who is going to speak with them?\\"\\r\\n\> Elizabeth yips, \\"Brenner often says to Liz that Lia is shady, but\\r\\nhas her uses, but never says what those uses are.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:35 [LocalGame\|Nyx] \\"They can sell her\\"\\r\\n\> 05:35 [LocalGame\|Nyx] \\"But yes, I want him to take her away\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad says, \\"However why treating her better then Caliste?\\"\\r\\n\> 05:36 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"Do you want it to be IG taken away or shall we\\r\\nsettle now it'll be done and ooc tell Elizabeth?\\"\\r\\n[LocalGame\|StoryGuide Tasha] \\"Flynn can do that, no problem, but do we need\\r\\nto tell Eliabeth's player that now?

Liz has tried to be nice to Caliste, and\\r\\nso on, but as of late, Liz has been under more stress, and Caliste has been\\r\\nwearing on her harder.

Of course.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:40 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"Btw, anyone wishes not add anything to what I\\r\\nsay to her now? I understand I detoured the talk a bit.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:40 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"Not too harsh at all. She'd still be able to\\r\\nplay in any other player-created guild.

As of late, Lia has said ICly, she \\"doesn't like to see people hurt,\\r\\neven if she hates them\\". Veritas and Liz just went through a rough patch and\\r\\nan ever rougher split up. Veritas speaks to Lia way more than Liz does, and\\r\\nhe probably tells her things, and Lia has walked in on Veritas and Liz\\r\\narguing, so Lia tends to make herself butt in. She was pretty understanding\\r\\nof Liz throughout the whole Veritas thing, and that sort of drew thin line\\r\\nof \\"Hey, maybe Liz isn't so bad\\" and \\"Hey maybe Lia isn't so bad.\\"... If\\r\\nthat makes sense?\\"\\r\\n\> 05:43 [LocalGame\|Sirazad] \\"I am fine with that decision. We have to talk\\r\\nwith the others though too.

I think it's easier to include, as far as\\r\\nLiz goes, Lia because there have been those ice-breaking scenes.\\"\\r\\n\> StoryPlotter Sirazad says, \\"And that 'I am not sure' is our biggest\\r\\nconcern.\\"\\r\\n\> 05:47 [LocalGame\|Azrael] \\"This is the player that was awarded a gentry\\r\\ncharacter recently?

I don't want this going around the game and I have learned my lesson to keep my friggin mouth shut when it comes to things that makes her uncomfortable. Emma just flies off the handle because she feels the need to fix it. It was one of those moments that made me want to leave the consulate to avoid scenes that keep repeating themselves. Instead of having people she can talk to, she feels like she has people that are trying to run or fix her life. I keep it all IC but no, this is not going to be a story I want to be apart or nor do I want Agatha to suffer. But she did that in an exam and then in the exam report, the healthiness of her hoohoo wasn't mentioned so... *facepalm* So I just don't know why it was done. And that is essentially what was expressed. I think the reason why this was blown out of proportion is because Gen has expressed to them she thinks that Agatha has a thing for Gen. But she never said she was assaulted. She -was- trying to get a different Healer to do the exam though because I/she was afraid that she would do that in the exam. So I had to talk about how healthy it was and her haircut and...

Because I am taken quite by surprise.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You have been approached eg by Caliste and other people and you cut it down every time with a 'leave me now', which is blocking and leaves no place for RP. This is entirely your right in a guild, but not in a house. Because a VP guild should focus on including people and every member of the house, not only a few.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"I believe you. I entirely believe that you didn't notice.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"But I also know that not noticing something and the something not happening isn't the same.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"We all get caught up in things we enjoy and that takes our focus into a given direction.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Focusing on one thing means not focusing on another thing.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa nods subtly, \\"As far as Caliste, I can think of one time I asked her to leave. I gave her a new outfit, she refused to tell Tess something she asked and I was in the middle of one of my House members basically calling me a liar and essentially spitting in my face before quitting.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Can you recall other scenes with her?\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa adds, \\"And Marcel as well. I began avoiding Marcel because he was becoming tedious and the RP was very cyclical, narcisistic and unenjoyable for everyone involved. So yes, I started avoiding him.\\"\\r\\nDo you mean heraldically, here-and-there, heretically, hermeneutically, hermetically or heroically?\\r\\nYou reassure Lady Theressa, \\"It is ok. Should you have issues with someone, you are always free to include staff, because that is how we can help you. We can only act when assists are filed, and if something is uneasy for you or makes you feel uncomfortable then staff can always help mediate.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa replies to you, \\"Only very very brief occasions where she would come in the area and clean trash cans, or return things I gave her before she belonged to the House, or come and go quickly without really engaging in the scene. I tried to be inclusive, Tessa obviously tries to show her favor to Caliste, but her and I don't really play at the same times, nor have my times been very easy to come by of late.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Could you present any log in which you try to include her in house related things and show your favor to her directly or indirectly via other house members?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Or list examples how you include her?\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa answers you, \\"Of the few occasions we have been in the same room, I try to greet her and smile and ask her how she is doing. I tried to inquire about the mysterious punishment Flynn gave her, but she refused to budge and simply told Tessa she would prefer to be treated as an object and not a person because being treated like a person is just confusing to her.\\"\\r\\nYou attemptingly explain, \\"I am not one who is focused on who did what wrong, you know that. I am more focused on issues being solved, so I am more interested how a given situation can be changed into productive and non-exclusive.\\"\\r\\nYou incline your head, \\"ANd how do you involve her in house matters? Or how do you generally motivate all the house members?\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa shakes her head disappointedly, \\"You have no idea how frustrating this is for me right now. I am trying DESPERATELY to get people motivated to do SOMETHING in this House and I am hitting roadblock after roadblock. I cannot even get people to come to meetings, I cannot get people to even write me scrolls. The only time I hear from anybody is when they want to bitch and moan about something not going their way and they want me to swoop in and miraculously fix it all. I have about 5 active House members to work with. One of which is going around undermining everything I do and not even TRYING to communicate with Tessa. It resulted in us losing a member that I thought was really promising.\\"\\r\\nYou repeat, \\"I don't want you to feel attacked, though that is likely easier said then done. My focus is not on what all happened, my focus is entirely on how you can contribute to the solving of the issues in a way that fits your OOC playing pleasure as well as the fun of others. That is my sole goal.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa additionally notes, \\"NOW I am finding out that despite all my efforts, people are accusing ME of being exclusive and blocking? I am begging people to get involved. I tried throwing a party and events conspired to make that impossible.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa nods, \\"And yes, I do feel attacked. Nobody even tries to talk to me about issues they have.\\"\\r\\nYou promise Lady Theressa, \\"I hear you, Tessa. It is not easy to lead a house. It is very difficult as a matter of fact. Many players have obtained the lead position and struggled with it, because this is a game and many players don't respond to it as they should, as showing up on meetings. All the houses suffer from it, and I understand that.\\"\\r\\nYou nod understandingly, \\"Maybe they tried and you didn't notice.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Which is fine, they might have been too subtle.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"However that is why staff is here, right? To communicate when communication fails.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"But then again, we should focus on the problems then, and let us list the problems, as there are some others voiced, and some you voiced. Which are different things. Your feelings are valid, just like feelings of others.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Please try to understand that there are many perspectives, and it is my wish to see them all. Yours as well as others. I ask you to try to comprehend why those complaints arose and how we can communicate better to make it not valid or to solve the issues?\\"\\r\\nYou check with Lady Theressa, \\"Ok? Will you give it a try?\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa nods to you blandly, \\"I never stopped trying. Again, this is all a very unpleasant, bittering surprise to me. I was always trying.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"And I believe you entirely. I know you have been trying, but maybe you have been trying in a way that hasn't brought the result you were hoping for, and if we can make alterations, then it will make you and others happier both?\\"\\r\\nYou ask Lady Theressa, \\"Because all of our players are important and valuable to us, let us start with you sharing what you found frustrating in the house and being a noble then. Ok?\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa replies simply to you, \\"The apathy is nauseating.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa shakes her head, \\"Nobody gives two shits about anything unless it directly BENEFITS them.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It is not easy to motivate people, it is really something that is not only you suffering with, but all the houses. So because I realise it is important for you, it is not your fault whatsoever that people don't attend house meetings.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa nods subtly, \\"It's not even just that. People don't even want to get involved in heavy things. They want to sit around and drink and banter and dissolve into OOC chatter.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Many people play to have fun, actually all do. And very few do things which don't directly benefit them. You are correct. But there is little you can do about it. You can Rp correctly with the ones who do care, and also you can use the fact people do what benefits them. It is very frustrating, I agree with such. Part of things can be done by staff to help you in that field, such as house related plots where people can show how great they are, which is a motivator factor. Even if you have ideas for house related plots we are happy to support them, if you contact us, we have done them before, so that's a possible path. Of course the players involved could do their own part, which is not something you can do anything about. What do you think is there for you that you can do?\\"\\r\\nYou listen to Lady Theressa meanwhile.\\r\\nLady Theressa shrugs subtly, \\"I've had ideas about throwing a tournament, since the only other thing to get people all excited is the idea of controlled violence and becoming the hero.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa admits then, \\"But nobody wants to work for anything. They want a tournament to be whipped up and placed in front of them out of thin air.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Who did you ask to help with the tournament?\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa says, \\"It's not a recent thing. It was a while ago. No body showed much interest beyond 'Oh, that would be really fun!\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa relates then, \\"The most recent party, I tried to get my handmaiden to help me by sending out scrolls and orders that I dictated. I found out after the fact she was complaining behind my back IC about how I work her too hard.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Lady Theressa understandingly, \\"Yes, But then that is something IG, did you ask her about it? You see there might be some players in the house that are willing to make those work, but aren't utilised.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa says, \\" She felt 'unappreciated'. I don't know how many times I have to say \\"I appreciate you, you saved my life, I love you, I couldn't live without you\\" as well as pay for this and that, et cetera.\\"\\r\\nYou mention, \\"I am not very easy about that situation. That is why it wasn't me deciding about the promotion tokens, I have voiced my issues once about it with you and it just appeared worse when Elizabeth was named for promotion. I asked Azrael to answer the assist.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"May I share how it looks from the outside?\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa nods.\\r\\nYou hrm, \\"Gods, how not to give away alts and still address this.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa nods, \\"It's it's about Liz, I know.\\"\\r\\nYou ask Lady Theressa, \\"Could you tell me who the alts are of Elizabeth? If I knew you are aware of that, I could help that.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa tells you, \\"Temperance. Tarahji recently. I can't remember the name at the moment, but the fiance of Silkar.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"That's ok. I just can not share alt information. I was sure you know, but you understand I want to be fair.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa nods to you surely, \\"I understand the implications. She and I are close OOC. We like to plot things together. She's the only other I found who gets as excited about things as I do.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa grins lopsidedly, \\"Makes me feel not so alone.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"So, I see that Theressa is often with Temperance and I make a PC and wander around town and listen to PCs talk. They confirm my suspicion, general view is that Theressa supports Temperanc against all odds. Then I talk with you and you confirm you'll deal with it. Then she makes an alt and that alt instantly ends up in the house as your handmaiden and reeve. On the other hand Temperance's friends is Brenner, who is suddenly also close with Elizabeth. You give in a promotion request for two people only, Elizabeth and Brenner. So I go out with another PC and try to learn what is going on and all I hear is that you three RP together without letting others chances. And then the assists start about the same topic. This is not really something I can walk by that easily.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"it is normal that people who like each other OOCly want to Rp together.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"We don't want to change that.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"As you said yourself, you RP with your circle. There are other people out there, just outside the circle. Maybe try to seek them out?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Eg when was the last time you tried to Rp with nobles? After all nobles should be seeking each other, right?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I don't want to flood you. I want to give you time and place to answer what I write. I am happy to listen to your side, that is why we are here.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa says, \\"AS far as promotions, I don't have many people to work with.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa says, \\"Brenner is on every day, has great ideas about what he wants to achieve, has plots in the works to build things and he regularly involves other House in conflict. Elizabeth is vital to me. I was failing in my role as leader till she came along. She helped me organise myself, was a bouncing board for not only my ideas and plots, but also a support shoulder for my stresses and strains. Who else is there? Bayard? Rarely on and when he is, barely talks. It's like pulling teeth to have a conversation. Alphonsus is new. Elgin? Never met her (him?) once. Not ONCE. Never even seen online. Nan? When I do see her, she is just pestering. I give her lessons, I tried to involve her by giving her a new job I made up specifically for her. Not about to promote her when she doesn't do work. Knockles? Barely online. Matthias? I can't get him to write and when he is online, he is shirking his job off on Veritas and undermining my authority. Aeryn? I got a scroll from her once. Haven't seen her online in at LEAST 6 months. Faye?\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa shakes her head disappointedly, \\"And the people I see regularly besides them? Passing in the commons, in the lounge? All they want to do is argue and buck authority. I try to be nice and engaging and friendly. I either get laughed at for being soft, or made fun of for being a 'snotty noble' with my head up my own ass.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Elgin, Caliste, Knockles I see regularly onlines. I have seen them online at the same time as you also. You have to reach out to people outside of your circle in a VP guild. I understand it is easier to work with people you are OOC familiar with and friendly with, but you don't even give chances to the others outside of that circle. Just try please. There are a lots of people there. Or let's see the Veritas case. How have you dealt with it.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa says, \\"Veritas decided to quit.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You can change that too. YOU can also change it. It is not only your fault or anyone's fault really, but you can change it.\\"\\r\\nYou smile at Lady Theressa encouragingly, \\"Tell me the whole story? There is more to it then that.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa says, \\"I asked him to join as a guard. I had it in the back of my mind that he would eventually be Captain. Mathias is Master of the Armory. They asked for steel, I imported steel, Ver asked for more work, I told him to work with Brenner, learn the ropes, practice, hold spars, guard the members, keep an ear out for news, et cetera. Next thing I know, he comes to me saying I lied and he wants more money and he thinks I don't care about the House goals or about making the House great. Then he tells me he's being asked too much for too little pay. Then he sends me a scroll and the entire armory because appartently Mathias made him the Master of the Armory and asked him to pay for a buncha stuff out of his own pocket.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa shakes her head, \\"I am about five minutes away from putting Tessa on the back burner for a while. This is all cutting WAY too deep.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa asks, \\"Is there a way for you to force a vote?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I am sorry for that. But what would you want me to do? What would you do in my place?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I listed what I saw, you didn't doubt that is what I saw. What shall I do?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And if you were on the other side, the one outside of the circle, how would you feel?\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa expresses to you, \\"I don't know what I would do if I were in your shoes. I don't even know what -I- am going to do. I am not mad at you. You made valid points. It is obvious that I have failed. I am not cut out for this role. I failed without even realising it. And I failed while trying my hardest to do the opposite. And that has lead me to the realisation that this is not what I thought it was going to be.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You are a wonderful, creative RPer, you know that. It is not failing. The role is difficult. Very difficult. And staff would be glad to help, we just don't know how to help exactly.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa says, \\"I became too personally invested in this role, made obvious by the fact that I am currently in tears. At my job. Over a recreational game.\\"\\r\\nYou hug Lady Theressa comfortingly, \\"I am sorry Tessa.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It really is not that you failed, leading the house is stressful. Very stressful. And we understand that. If there is any way I can help, then let us find that way together?\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa says, \\"I recognise that there are problems with how I have been doing things. Thank you for letting me know that there are problems. But I do NOT know how to fix them. And if I don't know how, and you don't know how, and I am becoming irrationally upset over this, I think it is best that I step down and take a break from the character before I become even more bitter, hurt, upset and disheartened.\\"\\r\\nYou squeeze Lady Theressa, \\"Whether you want a break or not is something only you can decide. I can only say if you are willing to stay we can work out together how things can be done. I can help you with some guidelines and to be honest you are not the only one in the house we have consulted with. Because it is not a single person issue at all. It is a very hard balance between playing with the people you enjoy playing with (because everyone does that, everyone really does and that's not something we can or will change. We only ask to give the same attention to others. Which isn't easy, as with lack of trust you ahve to take risks, which might hit back.)and now I am somewhat babbling because kids fall to the floor at my leg. brb.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Sorry about that, had to comfort them.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"So maybe we can work out things, that help. Such as finding things that profit those we want to motivate?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Eg there has been a house plot, it was told that if the house arranges for 3 tournaments in which they beat the dolos, then they get some land.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You could say that anyone who manages to do that, will get that land. That would certainly promote some attention.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You could also say that anyone who brings back the head of the pirate lead will get a promotion token? That again is something, that is important motivation. Or eg have a competition of beaty? And whoever brings the most beautiful girl to the jury will get a head jewelry piece?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"All of them include direct benefit for the one who organizes things.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And it would make them take off work from your shoulders.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Do you like the RP that comes from these types of RP?\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa says, \\"I have to be honest, because I want to do things right. I can honestly admit to you that right now, I do not think I will be able to continue in the role in the very near future, I will be unfairly biased in how I play. These recent revelations have colored me in a way that is not healthy, nor is it true to Tessa.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa says, \\"I've really taken this role way too personally, thus I have taken these criticisms way too personally and I need that space to regain my sight and not feel so hurt.\\"\\r\\nYou sigh, \\"I am not asking you not to RP with ELizabeth at all. But if you only rely on her then she complains behind your back and you get upset and try to give her more to sooth her, then it might be wise to have someone else TOO, not instead of her. Because heck, even I have my favored RPers, who doesn't? Everyone has friends they trust enough to feel the most comfortable about RPing with.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I am sorry I had to do this, Tessa. I really am.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It wasn't my wish to chase you or anyone away. Or to make the house fall apart. On the contrary.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"But it is your own feelings and you know best how to make you feel comfortable.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa shakes her head, \\"Don't be. You are doing your job. I can respect, admire and fully understand that. I'm not shooting the messenger. But the message was a slapp in the face.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa says, \\"I have invested a lot of time, energy, emotion, money and personal devotion to this role. And now I am getting the impression that it was all for naught. I brought NOTHING good to anybody.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"That is not true. The Avoirdupois has more active members then before and there has been some active RP in that regard. It brought people enjoyable hours.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"It was not for nothing, not to mention, you enjoyed it too (or so I hope) which is the most important aspect for you, after all you pay the enjoy the game, no?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"There has been conflict generated too, which is something difficult to handle, but a necessary and good part of the game.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I am not asking you not to give that. I am asking you to spread it to others too so more people enjoy the brilliance you have.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa nods to you, \\"And I was trying to do just that. And I failed. Miserably. And I had no idea. So now I am beginning to doubt not only my RP abilities, but also my perception of things. I am just stunned that I was that naive and shortsighted.\\"\\r\\nYou mention, \\"If you drive in a car, it is hard to say what color the car has from the outside.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You are again a wonderful RPer, and you enjoy RPing with your friends. That is a wonderful thing to do. All should do that. Nothing wrong with it.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Never doubt your RP abilities, as they are remarkable.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"it might happen that you were so rejoiced for the RP you had, that you forgot to check for other things. But that is so natural and human.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"You shouldn't lose trust in yourself, because you have a lot of things to be proud of.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And staff really thinks you are a very talented person who has great ideas about how to RP. We always enjoy reading your forum threads too.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa wanly grins, \\"Thanks. I appreciate the compliments. I really do.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I really think you should not lose trust in yourself, instead enjoy a new perspective that opened and use it to make your own game enjoyable.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Leading a house is extremely stressful. People have left the game before due to that. People should never forget that they should also have their own fun.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa decidedly confesses to you, \\"I would like to step down as leader. That is for sure. I am going to take some time and develop my alts, take a step back from Tessa and regain my perspective. Is there a way you can make the guild come to a vote?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Generally people say that leads are complained to all the time and they are expected to act. It is a mother or father type of role. People often think getting that position will grant a lot of things, and usually it brings work. It is difficult for people to realise that.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"ANd cope with the fact that while they work, other people think they have the power. Because only while being in the lead, does people's perception change to understand how much it takes from someone to lead. That is why we try to give personalised help to leads, if they ask and seek it.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"We can only do that if we are asked though. That's the catch.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa nods to you, \\"And that is my fault. I did not take advantage of the support system.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"As for the vote, no, if a leader is inactive for a month then players can ask for one. Or if 3 months passed. You can however assist and say that xy has the right to spend tokens and import items, in which case that person will function as lead.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Maybe my fault too for not communicating enough that there is a support system.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Do not be too harsh on yourself. It is never on a single person to make things one way or another.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Because in an ideal situation all people would RP. RP really well, and politics would bloom. A single nod or avertion of eyes would talk volumes. And people would struggle to gain the favor of some and disfavor of others.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"In which situations leading would be easy, right?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"But that's not the case. It is not your fault at all, that is not the case, is it?\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa assures you, \\"I'm trying not too be too harsh. It's tough at the moment, because the wounds are still fresh. I'll try not to log Tessa on for four weeks just to expedite things along. Until then, I will try to name someone to act as a lead.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"Remember to assist as lead that they have those powers, so I can accept them spending tokens etc.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa hugs you tightly.\\r\\nYou say, \\"I feel guilty a bit for making you this upset.\\"\\r\\nYou hug Lady Theressa comfortingly, \\"I should have offered help way sooner.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa assures you, \\"It's not your fault that I am sensitive and too critical.\\"\\r\\nYou rub Lady Theressa's back, \\"Your ideas about RPing are perfect and we think you are a real promise toward the game. I hope you'll find a niche you enjoy playing as you are a valuable player.\\"\\r\\nYou apologise, \\"I have to get my kids into bed. But if you need me for anything I am here after it. Even if it is just chatting. I have been in your shoes before. It is natural.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa squishes you, \\"Thank you so much again. You are very helpful.\\"\\r\\nYou smile at Lady Theressa, \\"That's ok. I am here to help and I hope I can do that. Just don't lose faith in your abilities. You are a worthy person and a great RPer.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa smiles, \\"Thank you, very very much.\\"\\r\\nLady Theressa notes also, \\"Happy holidays!\\"\\r\\n" \}) \}), ([ "warnings":1 ]) \}), "1268285856":(\{ "ts in the bathhouse", (\{  \}), (\{ (\{ "tonyd", 1268285856, "Shaharazad was tsing with Sattar in the bathhouse changing room.\\r\\nTalked with her and discussed the game rules.

Okay.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"I mean the complaints were against you, not you being excluded, sorry to be vague there.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha asks Brenner, \\"Any idea what scenes recently might be the issue?\\"\\r\\nYou nod to StoryGuide Tasha, \\"Bad grammar there.\\"\\r\\nBrenner says, \\"I am not entirely sure which scenes are being refrenced, but I'm free to talk about them at length if someone feels I've been being of poor manners, RP wise.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha agrees with you, \\"Yeah, that's why I clarified.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"Mainly it relates recently to the treatment of Caliste.  Telling her to be silent, to go away, multiple times, not letting her join in the conversations.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha asks Brenner, \\"That help you remember what might have been the problem?\\"\\r\\nBrenner says, \\"Hmmmn. I actually last recall the scene with her Brenner asking her to stay, but she wished to leave. But, if she has something specefic about my behavior to address, I'll cease it now. Recently I am of the opinion that the \\"slave\\" characters ICly are acting out of what would be normal for the time. And to be honest, I would rather have Brenner treat them with indifference than anger.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha nods, \\"If you think of slaves as historical American slaves, for example, then sure, they are not very IC.  They should be silent, only speak if spoken to, and so on.  But if you look at say Roman history, many slaves were more like unpaid trusted servants, advisors in many cases.  I think that is more playable in ICO.  It is boring to play a slave who is not allowed to share any opinions or say anything that might be taken as disagreeing with a free character.  They should not be really really rude, of course.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"The issue we have is that by having Brenner show indifference, and in fact more than that from the log I have read, which has him telling her to be silent, it is making it very hard for that player to play a slave in the House.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha asks Brenner, \\"What about other slaves? Do you have Brenner treat all of them with indifference?\\"\\r\\nBrenner tells StoryGuide Tasha, \\"Besides Lia, whom in my opinion manages to portray a better example of a slave who avoids angering her owners, while still RPing as she'd like, yes I do try to treat them with indifference. But if you or their handlers think I am blocking their RP in any way, I'll keep it in mind from now on.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"Thaks, that would be great.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"Especially for Brenner, rather than other characters as he is a member of the Avo House, which is a vp guild.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"we need the vp guilds to be very inclusive, you see.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"VP guilds get certain advantages over other guilds, so we need and expect the players in them to be extra inclusive.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBrenner nods to a field dominated by a carousel understandingly, \\"Mmn.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"just a sec, I type slow.\\"\\r\\nBrenner says, \\"No rush.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha tells Brenner, \\"To tell you the truth, I am getting a vibe from the Avo's at the moment.  A vibe of high school kids who think they are cool and part of that is excluding others.  But it is not really just IC, it is spilling over into ooc excluding as well.  Lots of whispering, blocking, and forming clicks with the people who are 'in', like Lia, and excluding those who are not, like Caliste.  Both are well behaved slaves, from what I see, in fact I would say Caliste is probably better behaved.  I hear Lia, on the other hand, hit Brenner with a tray or something? Doesn't sound that welll behaved traditional slave to me.  But that is not really the point.  The point is, we do not want any vp guilds to have a feel of nasty high school to them.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"we don't really want it in any part of the game at all, but we get to be more picky with the vp guilds.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha smiles at Brenner, \\"It is going to be hard for you to know what to change if you are not sure what it is that you are doing to give this vibe.  Any ideas?\\"\\r\\nBrenner says, \\"Mmkay. I don't think I've whispered or or asked Caliste to step from a scene in the last month. If Brenner trusts Lia more, (which he does) simply because she has spent more time around him, I'm not under the impression that I should be @assisted about because he is not, in particular, divulging this or that to Caliste. Is this what she's looking for?\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"I think the issue goes a bit beyond one person, or one scene, at the moment, to be honest. We're looking for a solution to what we see as an emerging pattern.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"I'm just checking the log I have to see if it was Brenner, or the others in the scene.  She was told several times to be silent when she was trying to explain about oaths.  But as Meerclar said, it is about a trend.  Did you know that the house is being perceived by many players as excluding?  As in, we hear concerns that others don't want to include the Avo's in general as they are so antisocial outside their own click.\\"\\r\\nBrenner says, \\"I think that, and this is from personal opinion, that I and perhaps others in the Avo may be playing to close to code. When I made Brenner, and when I chose to, I wished to play as exactly to the lore as possible for what he was. In the History page on them \\"Steeped in tradition, members of this house are known for their unfailing courage, their unfaltering attention to their chivalric code, and their intolerance for everything not \\"Avoirdupois\\".\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha nods, \\"Sure, I can see how taken the wrong way that would make you very excluding, despite best intenions for good rp.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha means, \\"intentions.\\"\\r\\nBrenner continues to practice his club skills.\\r\\nBrenner says, \\"I think that people are not so much being excluded by myself and others in the guild, more that they're not realizing that while snobby and intolerant, the Avo are predictable and, if you don't lie, cheat, steal, or pick fights with them, they're generally your best friends. If you flatter them.\\"\\r\\nBrenner says, \\"However, I'm sure this can or has as I now see, be percieved differently than I've intended.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha grins at Brenner, \\"Unless you are Lia.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"Who I think has lied, and I hear hit Brenner, and is still a best friend.\\"\\r\\nYou say, \\"And i am sure that not all the people that I have seen being excluded have lied, cheated, stole or fought with the house.\\"\\r\\nBrenner unsurely replies to StoryGuide Tasha, \\"I'm not sure why people are under the impression Lia and Brenner are best friends. She's fun to RP with on an OOC-level, and although Brenner will never trust her again ICly, he tolerates her \\"worse sides\\" because she's useful.\\"\\r\\nBrenner says, \\"And I don't know that those being excluded were actually doing those things. Brenner was told how they were acting by people in the House, and thus doesn't trust them. I can alter this, if it's bothering people.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"I think it is something all of the Avo's need to work on together.  We don't want to sit here and point fingers at you and assign blame.  We want to help you all to change the situation, so that everyone has more fun, including all of the Avo.\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Brenner gratefully, \\"That would be a huge step in the right direction for us, for the house.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"we do however, need to warn you that if things don't change, then we may have to remove people from the Avo house, being a vp guild, and they can play in a player run guild.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"so, you don't need to take all and sundry into your confidence, you don't need to tell Caliste all your secrets if you would prefer only to tell Lia, or who ever.  But please, no sending people away, expecting slaves to be silent, or only say yes sir, no sir, and so on, please.  Try to be inclusive at all times, cut right down on whispering, if you do that.\\"\\r\\nBrenner says, \\"Of course. You don't expect me to have Brenner not ask a slave not to speak out of turn though, I hope? Caliste, in the scene I believe you are thinking of, answered most of his questions or \\"commands\\" which I believe are a condition of being a slave, with another question.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha asks, \\"What sort of questions did she ask?\\"\\r\\nBrenner says, \\"I'm not sure this wouldn't warrant him becoming angry. I won't RP block in any way if I can from now on, but....I have the log...\\"\\r\\nYou ask curiously, \\"What conditions of being a slave?\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"I don't think from our point of view that being angry is a problem.  It is not blocking. It leaves the other player with something to respond to.\\"\\r\\nBrenner says, \\"I would imagine that accepting to being a slave means that you are ready to act out and theoretical commands that a freedman who owns you gives, no matter how irritating it may be on an OOC level. Unless it bothers you, in which case you may choose not to do it. Or however it is worded on the forums, I recall a thread.\\"\\r\\nBrenner says, \\"And, I really don't -want- to have any of my characters become angry at slaves. What would Brenner do? Hit them? He doesn't like that. He could remove privilidges for them if they anger him, but that would probably block RP more.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha asks, \\"Her questions, were they to clarify what it was that she was being asked to do?\\"\\r\\nBrenner says, \\"No. She was asking why not just beat her then.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha asks, \\"And what was he asking her to do?\\"\\r\\nYou nod to Brenner, \\"Yes, the character is a slave and should follow directions, but the -player- is not, and so they have the right to enjoy the game, and not be given commands that are OOC irritating. Does that make sense?\\"\\r\\nBrenner says, \\"It does.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"so lots of slaves should say ooc, hey, please don't order me to do that as I find it irritating.  Or you could ask them ooc if you are unsure why the slave is not following your order, hey, are you ooc ok with this order, or shall I take it back.  That sort of thing.\\"\\r\\nYou nod, \\"That is the sort of thing we include in inclusive roleplay. It certainly doesn't mean being IC nice to everyone all the time. That would be boring and sickening.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"I think lots of things in the game can't be 'accurate' entirely, or the game would suffer too much.  Like the role of women.  We don't play that terribly historically accurately as it would spoil it for lots of people who want to play female characters who are the equals of males.  I think the slave stuff is similar.  We need to simulate enough of the slavery aspects while still making them playable.\\"\\r\\nBrenner says, \\"Of course, I wouldn't want to be pushed out of scenes either.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha smiles at Brenner, \\"Thanks for being so helpful, appreciate it.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha says, \\"I think that was everything we needed to mention, unless you have questions?\\"\\r\\nBrenner shakes his head, \\"No, thanks for the talk.\\"\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha thanks Brenner also.\\r\\nStoryGuide Tasha asks, \\"Shall I put you back in your room or where I got you from?\\"\\r\\nBrenner says, \\"Oh, um...Room is good.\\"\\r\\nBrenner leaves.\\r\\n" \}) \}), ([  ]) \}), "1423362003":(\{ "Verbal abuse of staff", (\{  \}), (\{ (\{ "killandra", 1423362003, "The player has been issued a warning for cursing at staff.

Ask her IC to give Rup another chance, see what happens.  You might be pleasantly surprised.
