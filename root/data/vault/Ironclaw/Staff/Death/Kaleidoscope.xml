             carved kaleidoscope
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             The ivory kaleidoscope is a long hollowed tube created from the tusks of a rare reptilian creature residing beyond the map... in places marked "Here there be Dragons!" The outside is covered in very minute yet detailed carvings showing an olio of scenes. Each time they are examined, the eye knows not where to settle. Although white overall, the etched lines have darkened to a burnt brown with age, wear and use. The kaleidoscope is smaller on one end, the size of a child's thumb, and neatly capped with a brass ring. This is the end from which one would <acmd tag="command" cmd="gaze into tube">gaze into</acmd> the contraption. The larger of the two ends, about the size of a child's fist, is also capped with a brass ring yet it holds a clear, circular pane of thin glass from escaping.

             the carvings on a kaleidoscope
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             The minute yet detailed carvings on the kaleidoscope twist and turn under your eyes revealing... {a large, extinct reptile standing upon two cumbersomely large feet. It's arms are tiny and flail uselessly at it's sides yet it's head is huge and bears teeth longer than the width of a soldier's shoulders.|three spinning dancers with their short, frilly skirts twirling upward on a self-created wind. They wear leaf crowns in their hair which is pulled back in a tight bun; eyes raised skyward as if praising the heavens with their artistic steps.|a small hamlet during a holiday. Upon closer inspection, a faire can be seen within a farmer's field. Children are laughing and smiling while they ride a pretend horse and hold fake lances. Couples hide among the group; holding hands, kissing in the corners, and watching the children play.|a hare sleeping underneath a large oak tree. It's branches are spread wide as if to protect its charge from the bright sunlight. A little trickle of drool can be seen forming upon its lower lip. Passing by, at a slow pace, a tortoise is looking backward over its shoulder with a knowing grin.|a series of stairs which appear to lead nowhere. As you try to follow them upward in their cycle, you always end up on the bottom stair once more. What trick of the eye is this? Starting anew from the top and working downward, you find yourself staring at the top stair once more.| a feather but this is no simple feather; it is that of the mythical phoenix. The shaft seems to pump an unknown fuel to each barb. The barbs fan outward to create the vanes which do not appear soft at all but rather painfully bright as they are made of flame.|a sandwich. A really good sandwich held together by a freshly baked bun, the warmth still rising, which is as long as a grown man's forearm. Captured within, thin slices of the finest meat form the base for fresh lettuce, diced onions, slices of tomato, and a tantalizing secret sauce. A plump pickle rests off to the side.}
