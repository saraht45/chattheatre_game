          <Base:Description type="examine">
             A deserted village fishing village built upon a cal sea shore.<sbr/> by a high blocky wall. The top edge of the rocky crater can just be seen over the wall towards the west, it's strange colored smoke filling the air around you. Should you be worried about that? Buildings with boarded windows, and holes in some place or other in their structure, all line a dusty, pebble strewn street. Boulders, the same as the pebbles that were near the base of the crater, pulse with a green glow and dot the sides of the central street.
