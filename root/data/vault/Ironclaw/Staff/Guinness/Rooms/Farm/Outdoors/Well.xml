             blood stained large open courtyard
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             A large open courtyard spotted with various fruit bearing trees and numerous plants surrounding the open space. The area is dominated by a large water well in the center of the clearing. An artificial oasis where people can come to fetch water and pick through the various plants for food or seasonings. There is a thin cobbled path that leads through the courtyard and around the well in all directions. There is a small park-like area on the west side of the well under a shady willow with benches. To the south a path leads to a veggie garden, and a set of steps north to the farmhouse. There is also a pair of massive double doors into the farm to the east. Blood stains the ground in long dragging streaks all over, the farm seems deserted.

             An open courtyard containing the public well, which dominates the center of the space. There are a few surrounding bushes and trees, as well as benches in a shaded area. There is blood all over the place.
