             Fifty years later, the Avoirdupois made their challenge against the Rinaldi. During a decline of the Rinaldi's ability to police the landscape and to levy taxes, the Avoirdupois had become a military power to be reckoned with, with sophisticated strongholds and quality arms. KING ETIENNE D'AVOIRDUPOIS had consolidated his hold over the lands to the east of the Paludestris with his capitol at CHALON SU SAULDRE. At this time, Etienne's army was nigh-unstoppable in the plains, and his dominance over the River Sauldre was indisputable. His eyes turned to the wealth of Triskellian and its control of the Granvert and then back again to his own kingdom whose resources were limited to mere foodstuffs and soldiers.

             Fifty years later, the Avoirdupois made their challenge against the Rinaldi. During a decline of the Rinaldi's ability to police the landscape and to levy taxes, the Avoirdupois had become a military power to be reckoned with, with sophisticated strongholds and quality arms. KING ETIENNE D'AVOIRDUPOIS had consolidated his hold over the lands to the east of the Paludestris with his capitol at CHALON SU SAULDRE. At this time, Etienne's army was nigh-unstoppable in the plains, and his dominance over the River Sauldre was indisputable. His eyes turned to the wealth of Triskellian and its control of the Granvert and then back again to his own kingdom whose resources were limited to mere foodstuffs and soldiers.                                                              With prudence and with force, the Avoirdupois swept down upon the Rinaldi, intent on the city. The Rinaldi troops were well-advised and well-prepared for the onslaught. The young Don Constantin led an alliance of the Rinaldi and a host of minor houses in the defense of Triskellian. The use of magic figured prominently. Elementalists were found in the ranks on both sides, and the Church of S'allumer lent their services to the Rinaldi defenders.                                                              The relentless Avoirdupois pushed towards the city, undaunted by the Rinaldi defense, until their lines were within a league of the north and east gates, where they camped and began their siege. On the fifth day, King Etianne met with the Chamberlain of the Rinaldi court, CORRADO. The Chamberlain had orders to forestall the king and his plans to invade from the west, as it was evident even before the parley that nothing less than total surrender of the city would satisfy the Avoirdupois. However, there were strange portents in evidence.                                                              For several nights before the parley, Etienne had dreams of a vulpine maiden dressed in purple robes standing in a field of emerald green. The vixen radiated light that was as pure as the noon sun over the Avoirdupois plains. At his banquet table one night, Etienne happened to mention the dream in passing, and Corrado replied that these dreams must surely be visions of Saint Helloise who had saved Triskellian from ruin half a century before. The chamberlain further suggested that this must be a good omen and that he and theirs would agree on a peace soon. That night, the king received word that his wife had fallen ill, and that his unborn child might be lost as all means to save her had been inneffective. Unable to sleep, the king broke off negotiation with the chamberlain and sent him back to Triskellian.                                                              Word spread quickly throughout the city that the Queen of Avoirdupois had fallen ill and might not survive. Upon hearing the news, the ARCH-CARDINAL LUZIA, mother of Don Constantin, left the safety of the walls of Triskellian and entered the camp of King Etienne. Dazed by the glow of her presence, the knights of Avoirdupois dropped their weapons and stood clear of the path of Luzia. She entered the tent of the king, and what was spoken between them is unknown and unrecorded in the annals of history. What is known is that the next day, the seige was lifted and the Avoirdupois army had begun the long march back to the plains. The dawn of his arrival at Chalon su Saudlre, the Avoirdupois King and Queen (who had recovered) declared their conversion to the Church of S'allumer and their fealty to its greater good.

             With the allegiance of the Avoirdupois as an ally in commerce as well as in arms, the Rinaldi consolidated their position as the leaders of Calabria in both wealth and power. Increased commerce posed new difficulties. The Rinaldi commissioned the GUILD OF MERCHANTS to construct for them a system of exchange that insured transactions in the capitols of Avoirdupois, Doloreaux and Rinaldi. This new banking system allowed a trader to deposit money at one capitol in exchange for a 'writ,' which they could then redeem at any other capitol for the same amount of money. In addition, Rinaldi law for both nobles and commoners was recorded and made available in libraries, as well as records of court cases, verdicts, precedents and sentences.

The banking sytem, along with Rinaldi action in the courts of Triskellian, made contracts binding. Merchants could then expect that their shipments would be met with buyers and would be protected along the 'safe roads' to and from the Doloreaux and Avoirdupois lands. There was still considerable risk in shipment, but that risk could easily be defrayed by the price of goods commanded at market.                                                              Increased commerce meant increased influence and a rise in the power of the city Guilds. The Guildsmen established a council so they could exchange ideas and information with one another. DON FREDERICO, eighteenth Don of the Rinaldi, often called upon the Master Guildsmen to advise him on matters of commerce and to keep him abreast of new ventures. (In effect, the Don was relying on commoners in matters of state -- a portent of things to come.) Many businesses profited with the infusion of Rinaldi gold. With the strength of the LEX UNA behind the Rinaldi's coin, the DENAR, monetary institutions such as banks, money-lenders and investors came into being.                                                              Throughout the reign of Constantin and his next five successors, the power of the Rinaldi grew and prospered. Their wealth made them the envy of the world and they turned their time to amusements and to achieving the dreams that only the most wealthy can have. DON MATTEO, twentieth Don to the Rinaldi, expanded the palace and grounds of the central VILLA of the clan. The fountains amongst the gardens within became legendary. Don Matteo earnestly sought and enjoyed all things artistic and philosophic. He entertained the brightest minds of his day and showered them with praise and support. His patronage brought thinkers and artists from all over Calabria to Triskellian.                                                              Under the auspices of the Church of S'allumer, Don Matteo established a college of medical arts and a college of letters. Here the fine art of healing could be promoted and the history of the world could be recorded. Since the Church was very selective of the membership of its clergy, other healers were needed to serve the burgeoning populace, so the Church encouraged the study of 'mundane' medicine to support demand. Many scholars came to seclude themselves within the halls of the vast Library of Matteo there. The Guild of Navigators contributed a section of maps of all the known places in and around Calabria and expounded such new theories as a 'round world.' Explorers and merchants alike came to find the keys to fortunes there.

          <Base:Description type="look">
             Rumors began to circulate in the Rinaldi court that a clan of wolves had been challenging the minor houses of the western woods.  The Rinaldi lords at first ignored these rumors since it was common knowledge that the wolves of Calabria were ignorant savages who fought with primitive arms and no tactics.  When agents brought back reports of the sophisticated fortifications that had sprung up almost overnight around HARROWGATE, DON FABRIONE sent many messengers, agents, and spies to make further inquiries.  Few returned, but those that did told incredible stories of armored wolves who appeared from nowhere and struck quickly, demanding surrender and oaths of fealty to their clan and their clan alone, known now to be called the Bisclavret.

             Rumors began to circulate in the Rinaldi court that a clan of wolves had been challenging the minor houses of the western woods.  The Rinaldi lords at first ignored these rumors since it was common knowledge that the wolves of Calabria were ignorant savages who fought with primitive arms and no tactics.  When agents brought back reports of the sophisticated fortifications that had sprung up almost overnight around HARROWGATE, DON FABRIONE sent many messengers, agents, and spies to make further inquiries.  Few returned, but those that did told incredible stories of armored wolves who appeared from nowhere and struck quickly, demanding surrender and oaths of fealty to their clan and their clan alone, known now to be called the Bisclavret. The Don and his court were in disarray.  Spies could not give him an adequate count of the number of fighters the Bisclavret controlled, but it was certain they employed mercenaries from outside of Calabria.  In a display of power, the Don marched columns of troops up and down the Via Salutis; his troops limped back home, handily defeated and broken.  The Bisclavret warriors were highly mobile, roving over large stretches of land and able to form EN MASSE anywhere in the wood in a matter of days.  Don Fabroni sent emissaries to the Western houses to ask for their loyalty.  The Don's agents returned with vague and evasive answers.  He became despondent, lost in an attempt to control a land that no longer appeared to be his. Gradually, the flow of western resources, such as lumber and medicines, dried up.  Within two seasons, the Bisclavret were the unquestioned masters of the woods; only then did the Bisclavret High Counsel appear, formally requesting audience with the Rinaldi court. High Counsel WISSIAN came to the city of Triskellian with only a small guard of Bisclavret footmen.  At the same time, companies of mercenaries lined up and took positions along the River Granvert.  Wissian's audience with Don Fabroni was perfunctory and promising.  Both he and Don agreed that the Bisclavret controlled the woods and would continue to do so.  Wissian was very pleased and somewhat stunned that the first meeting had gone so well.  His letter to LORD ALDRED of the Bisclavret reflected his enthusiasm, and it was in this letter that Lord Aldred was first referred to as "King of the Woods".  Lord Aldred tempered his militant stance and withdrew his mercenaries from the river. The ambassadors of the Avoirdupois and the Doloreaux were displeased by the Don's weak display.  They sent word to their respective monarchs requesting quick action.  Don Fabroni knew that the ire of his two strongest allies was rising, and he set to work on a plan to mitigate this new imbalance of power.  He also knew that nearly every trade depended upon wood.  Without wood the city would suffer dearly.  The Don called for an assembly of the Guild Masters who had the greatest interest in lumber: the Sawyers, the Shipwrights, the Coopers, the Cabinet-Makers, and the Drovers (who took a large part of their earnings in shipping logs and finished products to and from Triskellian). The Guild masters were persuaded by their fellow Council members to enlist the aid of the western guild-halls of Thanon, Harrowgate and others in maintaining a steady supply of goods.  With the aid of a bit of coin, the Rinaldi and their allies in the Guilds reestablished the flow of materials.  Lord Aldred was likewise convinced that a more reasonable course was one of continued commerce.

             The Decline of the Rinaldi, and the Rise of the Guild Masters

          <Base:Description type="look">
             With the end of Rinaldi control of the city guard and of the banks, it became the Guild Masters who truly wielded the power within the walls of Triskellian ... and whoever controls the city controls most of the trade in Calabria.

             With the end of Rinaldi control of the city guard and of the banks, it became the Guild Masters who truly wielded the power within the walls of Triskellian ... and whoever controls the city controls most of the trade in Calabria. At first, organizations and alliances were uneasy.  For a time, the guilds regarded one another with suspicion.  Mercenaries were employed by each house to protect their "interests"; it was not unusual for important guildsmen to be bullied or beaten by armed thugs.  At the same time, tax collections failed to be met, and public works fell into disrepair, since clear leadership was lacking. This practice continued for many years, and Triskellian earned a reputation off-shore for a place where mercenaries and thugs could get work.  The racketeering came to a swift halt with the founding of the Sailor's Guild - almost overnight, the balkanized foreign warriors had their own organization to coordinate their activities.  With the rise of hired muscle came the rise in racketeering, banditry and theft.  Clearly something had to be done. Masters from all Guilds held a "moot" at the Customs House.  All agreed that there must be order, and all agreed that the order they wanted was not one of "blooded nobles" and their entourages holding sway over the citizens.  But who could make decisions and who could not?  Who was "in charge"? After a spirited debate of eight days, eventually the Compact of Guilds was signed by all recognized Guild Masters.  The Compact established that, four times a year, each Guild would meet to dictate policy, to entitle vote new Magistrates to the Constabulary, and to vote for changes in commoner law. It did not escape the notice of the Avoirdupois, Bisclavret, and Doloreaux houses that the public policy of the city was now being dictated by commoners instead of lords.  The Avoirdupois sent strongly-worded letters of disapproval of the state of the city to the Rinaldi; they were not answered.  The Doloreaux, for a time, refused to acknowledge the right of Constables to collect entrance and docking fees.  They later discovered that fighting the Constabulary wasn't worth it, as gates could be closed, gentry could be "mistakenly imprisoned", and numerous other inconveniences generated by the "commoners" would severely hurt their economic relations.  The Bisclavret made no strong remonstrations; in fact, many Brisclavret lords developed strong ties to the Sailor's Guild, hiring long-term mercenaries to expand their own holdings. Over the next few generations, a grudging alliance formed between the Guild Masters and the Noble Houses.  Despite the Noble House's claims to "divine right", no single house possessed the military might to challenge the stone walls and the garrisons of Thriskellian.  Given the differences of each house, an alliance seems unlikely ... but that doesn't stop some of the more ambitious lords from trying.  The lords are aware that the city is dependent on foodstuffs and raw materials from the rest of the island; an organized boycott (effectively a siege) could severely weaken the city ... but then who would conquer it?  If one house steps up to the role as conqueror, the other two would oppose.  The Guild Masters are well aware that it is in their best interests to play each house off one another, and until they forget this, the rule of commoners within the city is assured. The technology of the trade and commerce has continued to advance.  Ships now sail farther and faster, with larger hulls and greater cargoes.  The ports of Triskellian are inhabited by stranger and stranger folk from farther shores.  Recently there has been a rise in traffic from the mysterious land of Zhong Gou, their large painted sails with lettering in an obscure language and the crests of unknown houses.  At first they were a curiosity, but now larger and larger fleets settle into port, with such exotic goods as spices and silk being unloaded into the hands of an affluent populace.  The Guild Masters view such items with envy, wondering at the strange techniques required to make them.  The Noble Houses wonder how best to parlay with these foreigners, always eager for any changes that may tip the scales of power in their own favor, away from the commoner upstarts.
