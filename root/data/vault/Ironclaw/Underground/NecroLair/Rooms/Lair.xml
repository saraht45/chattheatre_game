             A mostly eery room, this dark space appears to be a designated workshop of sorts. Three granite tables have been aligned with the western wall, while a worn oak table holding various bubbling mixtures faces them. Each and every surface is littered with remnants of chemicals and herbs, as if not a single inch of the place was left to waste. The northeastern area proves to be a stand-out feature with lavish decorations lending an almost fashionable air to the otherwise bleak surroundings.
