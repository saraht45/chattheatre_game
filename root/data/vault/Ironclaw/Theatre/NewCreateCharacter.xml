      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:ape">
         X[S] Mysterious, solemn dwellers of misted forests and mountains, gorillas, orangutans, and others of their kind are large, threatening creatures with unexpectedly gentle inner natures. Barrel chested with long arms, short legs, and a highly developed musculature, apes can move by swinging through the trees hand over hand, like their distant cousins in the monkey races. Like the monkeys, apes have feet that can grasp as well as their hands; unlike them, however, apes have no tails. Forms can vary, lowlanders being bulkier and less prone to climbing, and highlanders tending to be slender and light. Colors can vary from reddish to black, coat length from a thin, even covering of fur to matted, shaggy pelts. Their gazes are indecipherable, masking whatever thoughts might hide behind them. Apes tend not to be territorial, except within their own groups. The stigma attached to them of being slow or stupid is undeserved; they are, in fact, wise and clever.

      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:armadillo">
         X[S] Hardy, compact denizens of the plains, armadillos offer perhaps the single best defense of all the races. Their rounded bodies are covered with lamellar plates of a bony hardness. This built-in armor affords them an advantage even when bare-skinned, whether it is a defensive or offensive situation. Armadillos have less than perfect eyesight; their highly developed sense of smell compensates for this, however. Some can detect quarry even when it is buried underground. Size can vary considerably; despite their physical advantage in combat, armadillos are smart creatures, and needn�t be confined to warrior roles. Those who are, however, are excellent subterranean fighters, capable of bracing their carapace against the walls of the passage to form a living, insurmountable barrier. Similarly, in ground combat, armadillos can withdraw into a ball-position, protecting their limbs from blows by means of their armor plating.

      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:bear">
         X[S] Honest, simple folk without affection or pretense, bears are lumbering giants who live in a wide range of climates, from the frozen north to the sun-bleached tropical forests and the equator. Characterized by large snouts tipped with wet black noses, small rounded ears, blunt, massive teeth, and huge, powerful limbs, bears overcome most adversaries through their sheer bulk and strength. Colors can be black, white, brown, pale or beige. Generally solitary, bears require only their own space; left to their own devices, they are always content. Disturbed in their home, however, they will pulverize an intruder. They�re accustomed to survival in the wild, and many are good fisherman, mountaineers, or swimmers. Wrestling is a sport of choice for many bears, given the way they can throw around their weight. They will endure hardships with patience, up to a degree. Experienced fighters know that bears aren�t the contemplative peasants they seem. At least, not in times of war�

      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:bear:sloth">
         X[S] Active mostly at night, the sloth is a noisy, busy animal. It grunts and snorts as it pulls down branches to get fruit, digs for termites, or snuffles under debris for grubs and beetles. Sloths lead solitary lives, and most are nocturnal. If threatened, these smallish bears will stand on two legs, brandishing their clawed forepaws as weapons. It is a common misconception that sloths are lazy creatures, due to their tendency to be slow and methodical. However, this is not a very insightful conclusion as most sloths tend to always be thinking, moving and generally performing some task or another. Even if the common onlooker is unable to tell.

      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:boar">
         X[S] Stern of resolve, boars are mercilessly stalwart and direct. Boars don�t give up the fight for anything; their stubbornness is legendary. Husky and cloven-hoofed, boars have sturdy squat bodies with coarse fur to hardly any fur at all; bulbous noses sensitive to scents; and tiny, short nails. Their appetites are insatiable and discriminating; they have a fine taste for roots and mushrooms of all kinds. Colors vary from species to species, most common being a muddy brown. Boars have prominent, curling tusks, which are basically overgrown, toughened teeth. The size and shape of the tusks have made them useful tools for digging, or extremely short-ranged combat. Boars are neither squeamish nor subtle, and are loath to ever show fear to anyone. Boars are social but surly, and will sometimes actively pick fights in the absence of conflict. A chip on one�s shoulder is considered a virtue among boars.

      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:cat">
         X[S] Mercurial, tricky and vicious, cats are arguably the strongest and most powerful of the carnivores. Primarily nocturnal, cats have powerful bodies built for lethal speed and strength in pursuit of prey. The feline-eye is particularly well-adapted to the dark, allowing cats to hunt under many conditions at virtually any time. Cats are acrobats by nature; overcoming physical obstacles can be part of the hunt for them. Their primary weapons are jagged, tough claws that are retractable in most species. Second are their long, sharp fangs; driven by powerful jaws, they are good for breaking the necks of any prey to disable it. Cats hunt and live mostly in solitude, disliking company. The only exception is the lion, a predator of the grasslands, who hunts in extended families called prides. Many species, such as tigers and lynxes, have stripped or spotted coats for camouflage. Cats are unpredictable; they may be at rest or figuring out the best way to disembowel you, and you won�t know until the moment they spring.

      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:cow">
         X[S] Quiet and thoughtful, cows have a tendency to think before they act but this thought process is so slow that often the decision to act arrives too late. Cows are instinctual mothers and givers, also gossipers and rumor-mongers. Whereas bulls are stubborn, quiet and fleet of foot once they have time to gather speed. Beware the horns but enjoy the hospitality of cows everywhere!
      </Core:Property>
      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:deer">
         X[S] Dwellers of plain and forest, the deer, elk and their hoofed kin are far more capable than would seem obvious. Often brown or tan in color and varying from lithe and slight to massive and ungainly, these creatures have common traits in their cloven hooves and, in the males, forward-swept antlers that can sometimes grown to be quite elaborate and deadly. In some species, antlers are honed and decorated, a source of pride. Deer, elk and their relatives are nomadic, skilled at foraging, camouflage and negotiating tough terrain. They are acutely aware of unusual scents, and tend to be nervous, occasionally darting out of sight when a threat is not yet visible. They are almost all of noble character however, and are unlikely to betray.
      </Core:Property>
      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:dog">
         X[S] Scavengers and mercenaries are common roles of wild dogs such as the coyote, who take on the warrior role not so much out of loyalty as an urge to fight. Pride isn�t always a driving force in their actions, and when it is, it�s a shadowy, cautious pride kept mostly to oneself. Lean carnivores with great stamina and sharp wits, wild dogs such as the coyote are used to starvation and poverty, and consider mere day-to-day tasks a battle in itself. Their appearances may vary, from the ashy, ragged coat of the coyote to the dusty gold of the dingo, but all have sharp, alert ears and the same hungry, searching eyes. Good at strategic planning and pursuit, the race fights just as much with tactics and entrapment as with claw and tooth. Howls, barks and various other primal vocalizations serve as long-distance communication for wild dogs, wordless yet as complex as any language. Wild dogs do not truly rest until they die.

      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:fox">
         X[S] Foxes are fascinating paradoxes. Kin to wolves and other wild dogs but posessing qualities of felines as well, foxes can be stoic yet playful, swift yet cautious, and have a wide range of character depending on the individual. Slight, handsome hunters capable of adopting to almost any environment, the different families of foxes have spread throughout the lands, coexisting with the natives through cunning and quick wits. Foxes come in many colors, including gray, white, black, red or even silver. They will take sustenance from whatever is available, be it game, wild plants, or if necessary, scavenging. Adept at climbing, hiding and tracking, foxes have an almost supernatural sense of when prey or danger might be near. As any noble can attest the Rinaldi are famed through out the land for this very attribute. Though wary of combat, foxes are unafraid; they'll find a weakness in any warrior or stronghold, given time.
      </Core:Property>
      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:horse">
         X[S] Robust and savagely beautiful, horses are unbreakable free spirits, forever carrying a piece of the wild with them wherever they roam. Fastest of the hoofed races and irrepressible in manner, horses work in groups and respect the chain of command. Horses have athletic bodies built for maximum speed and endurance as well as strength. Most have thinner coats than other races and long manes of thick hair that trial down their necks. Their galloping gait is best for traversing their most common home, the plains. Horses also have a knack for noting details and thinking carefully, and can be wellsprings of courage in daunting situations. Training and conditioning are very important to a horse, as well as tests of worth. While not all horses are Avoirdupois, their unity is still their greatest advantage.
      </Core:Property>
      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:monkey">
         X[S] Nimble, often noisy tree-dwellers, monkeys and their ilk survive and live from branch to branch, having feet and tails that can grasp and hold items almost as well as their hands. Often gangly, vociferous and less than graceful, they are nonetheless very sophisticated and wise. Their arms and hands are very strong, and their instincts are quick, allowing for any number of wild maneuvers, whether in combat or simply at play. They have exceptional eyesight and balance, making them good marksmen. Monkeys communicate their intentions loudly and with great emphasis, and are highly possessive of their domains and belongings. Family ties are also important to these races; surprisingly, honor is as well. The idiosyncratic behavior some monkeys might manifest is misleading. But they should never be taken lightly.
      </Core:Property>
      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:mustelid">
         X[S] Mustelids are subtle and complex, smaller than other meat-eaters but still quite powerful and sophisticated in their methods of hunting and battle. They tend to move fluidly, possessing slender bodies capable of any number of contortions and stretches. They strike fast and fiercely, using subterfuge to strengthen their offense. Beyond these common traits, however, These distantly related cousins vary greatly in character. The dark-brown martens and fishers of the forest are irritable folk, elaborate in their fighting techniques, and sometimes take on enemies greater than they out of sheer bravado. The delicate, winter-white ermines of the hills and flatlands are infinitely sly in their ways, aloof yet perhaps just as dangerous as their rougher counterparts. There are the roguish, handsome weasels, their dark-furred �masks� around their eyes belying a mischievous nature. No matter how beguiling a mustelid may be, they are not to be absolutely trusted.
      </Core:Property>
      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:mustelid:badger">
         X[S] Foul tempered and earthy, badgers and wolverines are both unforgiving and unafraid. Heavyset, omnivorous burrowers common to forested areas, badgers have strong neck and forearm musculature, striped black-and-white faces, small white-tipped ears and bodies ranging in color from gray to black. In rare cases, badgers can be white or red. They don�t pull punches and they speak their mind, and it�s not wise to argue, unless you have a thick skin.
      </Core:Property>
      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:mustelid:otter">
         X[S] Otters live in two worlds, land and sea. Kin to the mustelids, otters have slender, streamlined bodies, and smooth, slick fur that allows them to streak through the water. Like fish fins, their fingers and toes are webbed for easy paddling. They are found where their swimming skills can be used, be it by a river, along the shoreline, or sailing the open sea. Some otters possess short, stubby claws and superior manual dexterity. Otters can have any sort of description, depending on the individual. Some live difficult lives, and can be antagonistic and fierce; others are laid back and content to fish and live simply, and can be trusty companions. Unique in their aquatic prowess, otters can use the water as an advantage over land bound adversaries and explore places others cannot.
      </Core:Property>
      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:mustelid:wolverine">
         X[S] The savage, raging wolverine is a hulking marauder of the mountains with slicing claws and a natural desire to inflict pain. Wolverines are dark brown in color, with yellow stripes and a white forehead marking. Wolverine fur has the unique ability to shed ice crystals. These brutish cousins to other mustelids have claws and teeth which they use with furious fervor, often in hair-triggered, roaring frenzies. They are very social among their own kind, often hunting and gathering in large, boisterous groups. They don�t pull punches and they speak their mind, and it�s not wise to argue, unless you have a thick skin.
      </Core:Property>
      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:rabbit">
         X[S] Legend may not honor rabbits as brave warriors, but when all others have ended the chase, the rabbits will still be afoot.  Some say that rabbits are a lucky race, but others attruibute their good fortune to their speed and their common sense to run from dangers where others are too stubborn to give ground.  Strickly eaters of plants, rabbits are alert creatures that can go from a standstill to a blur at the slightest hint of danger.  They range from arid climates to grasslands and forest to tundra, with colors ranging from black to tawny gray to white. Their enormous ears are sensitive to sounds and changes in the wind, and their long, well-muscled legs and feet allow them to spring into a run quickly.  Rabbits have many children, and clans tend to be quite numerous -- in fact, the rabbit warrior who runs from battle may quickly return with a dozen or more of their cousins.
      </Core:Property>
      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:raccoon">
         X[S] Solitary, dexterous creatures with a knack for getting into places they don�t belong, raccoons are often thought of as duplicitous bandits; this is not always true, as many use their abilities simply to sustain themselves. Generally short and pudgy, raccoons have a thick, grayish-brown coat, a dark �mask� of fur around their eyes, and dark rings around their tails. Their articulate fingers provide them with superior tactile ability, good for determining the qualities of an unknown item and feeling for traps. Raccoons are inherently curious, and enamored of shiny objects. Their charming, innocent faces and soft bodies can be deceptive; raccoons will fight viciously if cornered.
      </Core:Property>
      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:rodent">
         X[S] While close kin, mice and rats have very different natures from one another indeed. Both types of rodent are small, speedy seed-munchers. All rodents have a tendency to explore the darkness and draw trouble like a magnet. Mice tend to be meek and shy (though a few have been known to show valiance and bravery), wheras rats are, by and large, greedy and spiteful. Both races are compact in form, with tiny paws, long tails and huge eyes with good peripheral vision. Both species are rugged travelers, capable of finding refuge almost anywhere. But where mice will captain a ship, rats will be the stowaways where mice reap and store a harvest, rats will gorge themselves on it; where mice explore in earnest, rats will plot and scheme. They populate the entire world, in all nations and places; if rats ever overcame their corrupt ways and unified, they could be an unstoppable legion.
      </Core:Property>
      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:skunk">
         X[S] Stocky, gregarious omnivores, skunks have strengths and skills that are not always apparent. The skunks are mostly black with white markings that usually take form of stripes or spots. Skunks are proficient not so much in offensive traits as defensive ones. Short limbs hide sharp, powerful claws. A highly-developed sense of smell makes skunks good at tracking. Their primary and most infamous defense, however, is the foul-smelling musk capable of being sprayed at their foes. Anyone who stands their ground at the sight of a raised skunk tail is a fool. Their musk incapacitates most creatures by blinding the eyes and burning the nose. Because of this, skunks make excellent rangers and guardsmen. They are quiet ones, speaking only when it is wise or necessary.
      </Core:Property>
      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:unknown">
         X[S] "As I cast my eyes about, I could not believe the sheer variety of shapes and sizes I beheld. Could Calabria hold so many? Surely it must be filled to bursting. Here a wolf, there an otter, passing by me the imposing form of a rhinoceros. But I am a country lad from a poor manor and my gentle eyes are too accustomed to my home in our tiny sunlit valley. Triskellian was like a mountain top in a flood -- all rush to its peak for safety."\<br/\>

      </Core:Property>
      <Core:Property property="descriptions:animals:wolf">
         X[S] Powerful, noble creatures with great strength and endurance, wolves are large carnivores with senses and forms built for the hunt. Coloration varies from pure white in the high north to gray, red or black patterning in warmer, southern parts. They live in packs, tightly knit social groups with exceptionally strong family ties. It is said that even a wolf who is not a Bisclavet is a Bisclavet all the same. There are no orphans amongst the wolves. The hierarchy in a pack is critical to their existence; the leaders are a male and female who have proven their superiority over the others. Weakness is not tolerated; in a race that is driven towards dominance of their environment, those that are sick or lame are cast out of the pack. Beyond words, wolves communicate by bodily gestures such as tail and ear posture; by scent markings to define territories; and by howling, a baleful, wordless song that can convey a myriad of thoughts or emotions. The howl of the wolf is legendary; a reminder of who owns the wilderness in which it is heard.

         X[S] Welcome to the IronClaw Character Creator!\<br/\>
Azrael is currently working on new character creation code (and has been for years), which will go here (or somewhere else and you'd never know) when I'm done (in the next century).\<br/\>
Everything you see here is very unfinished (is actually almost completed), so either close this window (please don't), or else click at your own risk (that's right, click the button. It's very tempting, isn't it?).\<br/\>
Disclaimer: If you click on anything (which you obviously did in the first place just to get this far), and it does anything (we hope it does something), then it's not my fault (Blame uh... Khalea.). Unless it was meant to do that (How would you even know what was meant to happen?). Then I claim credit (Damn, egotistical coders... but, yes, he did do it all). Unless it was a bad thing (which can still be a good thing, for us), even if it was meant to do that. Then I claim credit while simultaneously denying blame (He would make a great politician). Thank you.\<br/\>(Smartass remarks copyright of Death, an unregistered trademark of Hell, Inc.)
