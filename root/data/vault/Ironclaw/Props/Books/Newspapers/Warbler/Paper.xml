Pirate Menace, Defeated!
(By Sang Rouchambeau)

In a powerful alliance of the Guilds of Triskellian and the four Noble Houses the Pirate scourge responsible for plaguing our waters has now been routed. Valiant battles were fought on all ships, the bravery of our fighters won the day with no reported deaths on our sides at all.

In the words of Capitaine Brenner du Prideaux, Marshall of House Avoirdupois and squire to Sir Edmond Boulanger D'Avoirdupois, "I believe that piracy is vile, the House forces, though originally hampered by a bit of squabbling, came together and did a wonderful job." He also believes that all fighters should be commended for their efforts.

The pirate ship that was unlucky enough to tangle with the House forces lost their captain after he engaged Sir Bayard three times, the noble knight vanquishing his foe with one final and powerful blow to the face. The fighters aboard the guild ship fought just as bravely. Their ferociousness caused the pirates to turn on themselves out of fear for their lives, on of their number driving a blade into the back of Black Pete, a name that will never blight us, the citizens of Triskellian, ever again. 

Congratulations to all our brave fighters on this brave victory.

Maymay hung by Constabulary!
(by Valentin Forza)

The slave known as Maymay was recently discovered to be in possession of weapons, and suspected of being an assassin.  Another slave, by the name of Ryan, recently reported that Maymay was holding weapons in her private possession.  Such is clearly a breach of the law, and punishable by death.  She was detained by Sheriff Joshua, and sentenced to hang.  At the gallows, she was heard to say, “Lutara forgive.”  Shortly thereafter, she was hung by miss Faile.  

Those assembled then had to decide what to do with the corpse.  Miss Faile suggested, "It always improves fishing when a body's been left in the bay.”  However, after Mistress Meepers suggested the Church be consulted, it was agreed to lock the corpse in a cell until the Sheriff could speak with the proper authorities.

Mari MURDERED in Docktown Commons!
(by Valentin Forza)

A violent feud between Mari and Luciano apparently began in the training grounds.  Luciano was sparring with Milli and had just been disarmed when Mari allegedly snuck up and attacked him from behind with a flail.  Mistress Meepers witnessed the altercation, and treated Luciano’s injuries.  “I examined Luciano and he did have some broken ribs and possible internal injuries,” Meepers said in her testimony.  Mari has been said to suffer from mental disturbances, and she testified that she does not remember attacking him.

Just a few days later, there was another incident between the two in the commons.  This one was much bloodier.  Temperance, who had treated Mari for her head injuries, was present when Luciano became angry and “started to badger her, calling her vulgar things and making lewd comments.”  Mari then drew her weapon, prompting Luciano to draw his.  Luciano was the first to attack, and cut Mari badly in the stomach.  He seemed determined to kill her.  According to Sir Edmond of House Avoirdupois, “Even after she was mortally wounded and incapable of defending herself did he proceed to end her life with another thrust of his rapier.”

Both Mari and Luciano appear in the Constabulary files for past criminal investigations.  As of the 4th of Grass, no arrests had been made.

SERIES: The Nine Vices!
(by Presbyter Ximen)

Apathy is the act of not caring, a distinct lack of interest in or concern for things, people, and situations.  This sermon will try to address a major problem in our faith. It is the issue of drifting through life; of waiting for things to happen and doing nothing to make them happen.

Someone has said that the epitaph of our society today should be this: 'This civilisation died because it just didn't want to be bothered, it didn't care'. We can all testify to that, can't we? But as we sit this morning, snug and warm within these four walls of a church building, I don't know about you, but I feel that - like a trickle down effect, like a filtering - the attitude of the world with regards to apathy has come into the church. We have assimilated a spirit of apathy.  Young people, I'm talking to you - but I'm not just talking to you, I'm talking to the young marrieds, I'm talking to the middle-aged people and even the older people. The spirit of the age, if it be apathy, has affected all of us.

Let's bow our heads, just for a moment, and ask the Lights help this day: Great Light, we thank Thee this morning for Thy goodness to us, we thank Thee for Thy faithfulness and Thy loving kindness. Great Light, we think Thee this morning for our young people. We thank Thee, our Light, for those of them whom Thou hast saved. Great Light we pray that Thou wouldst build them up in their most holy faith, from strength to strength, and conform them more and more, daily, into the image of thy faith. Great Light we pray this morning that as we would open it, and as we would seek to learn from it from, Thou wouldst help us. Great Light, whatever it is that Thou wouldst have us learn this morning, we pray that our hearts would be open to accept it in grace. For we ask all these things in Helloises name, Amen.

COLUMN: Do's and Don'ts of Fashion
(by "Mistress Meepers" Tara di Draco)

Spring is coming in slowly but still striving to arrive.   In this season before summer, the weather will be a become a bit warmer with a touch of nippiness in the air.   Fashion needs to match this season and here are some tips to help you dress appropriately.

Let us start with inappropriate clothing.   And example would be "short-shorts" being worn by themselves with a top.   I can not express the degree of my disapproval toward this inappropriate garment.   The short shorts were not designed to be worn as outside clothing but as under garment clothing for kilts and skirts and/or with certain kinds of armor.  To wear these on the outside and by themselves is indecent!   If you wish to wear them on the outside then they must be worn with hose or tights.   

Bodices, corsets and especially underbust corsets, are to never be worn by themselves.  These garments are designed to give the waist and bust shape and such.  If worn by themselves it is grossly and I mean grossly indecent and could get you arrested as they do reveal much too much more then most would care to see.   Please wear either a chemise or short sleeved  or blouse  or ruffled blouse under these items with the appropriate other garments to go with them.  

I also wish to speak to on types of materials that should be used when ordering a gown, dress or blouse and such.   Now with the warmer weather most of us that have lots of fur do like to order things that are more light and airy.   That is alright as long as proper modesty is adhered to.   If you wish a blouse with a lighter material or even one that borderlines slightly see through…be sure to wear the proper garments underneath.   We do have Camisoles and underskirts and short sleeved chemises.   For modesty sake use common sense and wear something appropriate underneath to avoid disfavoring glances.   Now I do mostly speak to woman here.  Men of course can wear these materials with shirts without having to wear something underneath but must give caution if they attempt this with pants.   This is most indecent for a man to wear such flimsy material with pants.    

Next addition I will give some examples for good spring outfits and colors.
