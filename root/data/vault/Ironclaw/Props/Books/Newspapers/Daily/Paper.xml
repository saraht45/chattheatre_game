             The first page of The Daily. It says:
"The Ballad of Captain Rannos



Greetings One \& All of Triskellian! Seems I've been lacking in reporting the news. Well here it is for you - a bit of news that seemed to be floating about as of late. Mayhap it will solve our pirate problem to some degree!

My name's Cap'n Rannos
when I sail when I sail
Me name's Cap'n Rannos
when I sail.

Best afear of old Rannos
and the seas I sail across
oh me gain will be your loss
when I sail.

Tried to put me in the noose
Oh they put me in the noose
They put me in the noose
But the devil I seduced
Made the bastard set me loose.

I spied ships from Chalon
Oh I spied ships from Chalon
I spied ships from Chalon
And with my wit and my brawn
took the ships and all upon.

I spied ships from the west
and they tried to make arrest
Didn't go like they'd assessed.

I Spied some ships from bruges
snuck aboard and lit some fuses
and I blew apart the losers.

I blocked Triskellian port
set aflame the whole of court
made shutting down trade a sport.

I've had my share of booty
and though some might think it's fruity
Black Pete really was a cutie.
