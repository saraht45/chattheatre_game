Maymay hung by Constabulary!
(by Valentin Forza)

The slave known as Maymay was recently discovered to be in possession of weapons, and suspected of being an assassin.  Another slave, by the name of Ryan, recently reported that Maymay was holding weapons in her private possession.  Such is clearly a breach of the law, and punishable by death.  She was detained by Sheriff Joshua, and sentenced to hang.  At the gallows, she was heard to say, “Lutara forgive.”  Shortly thereafter, she was hung by miss Faile.  

Those assembled then had to decide what to do with the corpse.  Miss Faile suggested, "It always improves fishing when a body's been left in the bay.”  However, after Mistress Meepers suggested the Church be consulted, it was agreed to lock the corpse in a cell until the Sheriff could speak with the proper authorities.

Mari MURDERED in Docktown Commons!
(by Valentin Forza)

A violent feud between Mari and Luciano apparently began in the training grounds.  Luciano was sparring with Milli and had just been disarmed when Mari allegedly snuck up and attacked him from behind with a flail.  Mistress Meepers witnessed the altercation, and treated Luciano’s injuries.  “I examined Luciano and he did have some broken ribs and possible internal injuries,” Meepers said in her testimony.  Mari has been said to suffer from mental disturbances, and she testified that she does not remember attacking him.

Just a few days later, there was another incident between the two in the commons.  This one was much bloodier.  Temperance, who had treated Mari for her head injuries, was present when Luciano became angry and “started to badger her, calling her vulgar things and making lewd comments.”  Mari then drew her weapon, prompting Luciano to draw his.  Luciano was the first to attack, and cut Mari badly in the stomach.  He seemed determined to kill her.  According to Sir Edmond of House Avoirdupois, “Even after she was mortally wounded and incapable of defending herself did he proceed to end her life with another thrust of his rapier.”

Both Mari and Luciano appear in the Constabulary files for past criminal investigations.  As of the 4th of Grass, no arrests had been made.
