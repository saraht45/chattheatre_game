SERIES: The Nine Vices!
(by Presbyter Ximen)

Apathy is the act of not caring, a distinct lack of interest in or concern for things, people, and situations.  This sermon will try to address a major problem in our faith. It is the issue of drifting through life; of waiting for things to happen and doing nothing to make them happen.

Someone has said that the epitaph of our society today should be this: 'This civilisation died because it just didn't want to be bothered, it didn't care'. We can all testify to that, can't we? But as we sit this morning, snug and warm within these four walls of a church building, I don't know about you, but I feel that - like a trickle down effect, like a filtering - the attitude of the world with regards to apathy has come into the church. We have assimilated a spirit of apathy.  Young people, I'm talking to you - but I'm not just talking to you, I'm talking to the young marrieds, I'm talking to the middle-aged people and even the older people. The spirit of the age, if it be apathy, has affected all of us.

Let's bow our heads, just for a moment, and ask the Lights help this day: Great Light, we thank Thee this morning for Thy goodness to us, we thank Thee for Thy faithfulness and Thy loving kindness. Great Light, we think Thee this morning for our young people. We thank Thee, our Light, for those of them whom Thou hast saved. Great Light we pray that Thou wouldst build them up in their most holy faith, from strength to strength, and conform them more and more, daily, into the image of thy faith. Great Light we pray this morning that as we would open it, and as we would seek to learn from it from, Thou wouldst help us. Great Light, whatever it is that Thou wouldst have us learn this morning, we pray that our hearts would be open to accept it in grace. For we ask all these things in Helloises name, Amen.

COLUMN: Do's and Don'ts of Fashion
(by "Mistress Meepers" Tara di Draco)

Spring is coming in slowly but still striving to arrive.   In this season before summer, the weather will be a become a bit warmer with a touch of nippiness in the air.   Fashion needs to match this season and here are some tips to help you dress appropriately.

Let us start with inappropriate clothing.   And example would be "short-shorts" being worn by themselves with a top.   I can not express the degree of my disapproval toward this inappropriate garment.   The short shorts were not designed to be worn as outside clothing but as under garment clothing for kilts and skirts and/or with certain kinds of armor.  To wear these on the outside and by themselves is indecent!   If you wish to wear them on the outside then they must be worn with hose or tights.   

Bodices, corsets and especially underbust corsets, are to never be worn by themselves.  These garments are designed to give the waist and bust shape and such.  If worn by themselves it is grossly and I mean grossly indecent and could get you arrested as they do reveal much too much more then most would care to see.   Please wear either a chemise or short sleeved  or blouse  or ruffled blouse under these items with the appropriate other garments to go with them.  

I also wish to speak to on types of materials that should be used when ordering a gown, dress or blouse and such.   Now with the warmer weather most of us that have lots of fur do like to order things that are more light and airy.   That is alright as long as proper modesty is adhered to.   If you wish a blouse with a lighter material or even one that borderlines slightly see through…be sure to wear the proper garments underneath.   We do have Camisoles and underskirts and short sleeved chemises.   For modesty sake use common sense and wear something appropriate underneath to avoid disfavoring glances.   Now I do mostly speak to woman here.  Men of course can wear these materials with shirts without having to wear something underneath but must give caution if they attempt this with pants.   This is most indecent for a man to wear such flimsy material with pants.    

Next addition I will give some examples for good spring outfits and colors.
