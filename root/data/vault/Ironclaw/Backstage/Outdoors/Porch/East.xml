          <Base:Description type="examine">
             This is the eastern portion of the porch attached to the StoryHost's House. It extends to the <acmd tag="command" cmd="west">west</acmd> while having no access to the outside world. The floor has been laid with strong hickory slats on the diagonal and sealed lightly to protect against the elements or scuffing. To the north, the porch is attached to the main house built of split logs. To the <acmd tag="command" cmd="look view">south</acmd>, a waist-high rail runs the length of the porch and a splendid view can be seen in the distance. Log beams reach upward from the rail and support a low, over-hanging roof that saves the porch from most of the weather. A rocking chair and a few willow chairs are scattered about to relax upon. [The porch is the only area set-aside for visiting players and discussions with said players. No non-staff members are allowed inside the House.]
