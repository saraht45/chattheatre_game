I tell ya they were evil magi who still haunt us.", "Sir Guillaume and Lady Persia is a most peculiar couple. He's a horse and she's a cat. Her past is less than desirable as well. I'm really surprised the Avoirdupois allowed them to wed in the first place, not to mention, they've gotten children together. Magic I told you, magic, there are spells cast over them.", "Did you see that magnificent steel sword the knight was wearing? Do you know where the steel come from?

No one is more honorable than they are.", "There's an Avoirdupois noble who once worked in the old cat house as a whore!", "The Avoirdupois has the oldest known castles and have the longest written records of anyone in Calabria. That's why they say they're the oldest noble family on the entire continent, something which of course the Rinaldi dispute.", "Some say it was the necromancers who burnt down the chapel for their own uses. I've heard whispered that they helped rebuild it too.", "I heard that the Avoirdupois want control of all of Calabria, ruling all the other noble houses and races. I tell you, that's why they're building up such a huge army!", "The Avoirdupois believe that all other noble houses should be evicted from Calabria. They claim to be the only true noble house.", "The Capitol of the Avoirdupois is Chalon su Sauldre.", "Did you know that there are bathing houses both in Docktown and New Town? Especially the one in New Town is interesting to visit. I've heard that the nobles and rich merchants tend to hold their business meetings up there.", "Be nice to the wolves if you want fancy lumber to work with. The best woods come from the forests of the Bisclavret and they control the trade pretty tightly.", "Dame Charlot and Admiral Murdoch have been seen together quite a bit, even sneaking around alleyways... what could they be up to?", "I heard that the Bisclavret have a new weapon. They call it guns; it uses a dark powder that burns really quick. With a gun they can kill people from a distance. Dark magic is what I call it!", "They say that the Bisclavret turned away the barbaric traditions of the Phelan, whom are their half-brothers, and embraced the light of S'allumer. But if you look closer into things you'll notice that official policy isn't always that of private policy. It's some interesting things you can discover if you dig a bit.", "The control over the north-western forests of Calabria has given the Bisclavret the economic power to build an army second only to the Avoirdupois. The might of their mercenaries and the quality of their troops should not be doubted, though being a very young noble house, their morals and honor can be quite different from the other houses.", "The Capitol of the Bisclavret is Harrowgate.", "Have you heard that the Bisclavret rose to power centuries ago. The smart tells that they were originally a Phelan clan, known as the Bianfael. They converted from following the Druids to worshiping S'allumer, and passionately believe in their destiny. They are often known to break from tradition, and are avid about anything regarding changing the future: new inventions, fashions, customs, and of course, astrology.", "The Blacks used to be a feared mercenary company that ruled Docktown with an iron fist.

His noble background naturally sent him to the Bisclavret where he found a home. They say that his talents are many and some are even seen as better than those of adults.", "Did you hear about how mister Brumble created the Rinaldi Trade Union supported by the Rinaldi to control a lot of the trade in the city? The Rinaldi Trade Union has been very successful. Do you have any idea of what the secret to his success is? The only thing I know is that he knows how to speak to nobles and is a great salesman.", "The Rinaldi are the oldest noble house of all of Calabria. The Bisclavret are the youngest, upstarts, barely real nobles. I heard they forced the Rinaldi to acknowledge them as nobles; else they would have started a war.", "It's said that among some scholars, there is a growing body of evidence that, millennia ago, a group of wizards were capable of magicks that were either similar to White Magic or even the same White Magic spells known today. Doesn't that go against the church's teachings that White Magic comes from S'allumer?", "Don’t sail to the Broken Coast if you can avoid it. It's a hell to go through with whirlpools and unpredictable storms, reefs and shallow waters. If you hear a captain bragging that he has survived there, do ask him for proof, for it is quite unlikely. Though I did hear there were a few fool hearted people who survived a storm through the narrow straits and dangerous cliffs.", "If you dream of paradise, white beaches and palm trees, hospitable people and a good trade, then you should take a look at the Corsair Islands, though I've heard there's a pirate city out there somewhere, so beware how you flaunt your gold.", "Admiral Flynn has shipped slaves into the city at the request of Miss Lianaar. Many of the slaves died on the trip, nearly a hundred, though there are those arguing that their lives might have been rescued instead. Those prisons are hardly healthy places to stay, ya know", "The Paludestris is a huge morose swap which has many legends surrounding it. It's said to be inhabited by dangerous monsters, the undead, giant lizards, dragons and ghosts! Some of course say it's just bandits and outlaws who fuel the legends to keep bounty hunters away.", "I’ve heard a rather peculiar rumor, though I don't know if it's true or not. They say there's a fox family living in the dangerous Paludestris swamps, a family of grey foxes who fell into disgrace. Their name is Jakoba, the same as our Queen.", "Don't go to Epinian if you don't like the cold. It's a sad excuse for a city I tell you. Not even the warmest of summer days can melt the snow of the ground. Why go there you ask me? Well, they do have these amazing mines where you can find gold and diamonds to fulfill any weasel's dream.", "Don Constantin commenced the construction of the magnificent cathedral of Triskellian. Nothing that magnificent and impressive has ever since been undertaken by the Rinaldi. It's said that to support the great dome, a great spell was woven by the first apostles of the church, the power of which lasts to this day. People from all over Calabria pilgrimage to Triskellian to see and experience this wonder.", "The Cathedral, besides being a place of reverence, is a site of great learning and contains what may be the largest library in the known world. You can find it up in New Town.", "Did you know that the awe inspiring, transparent dome of the Cathedrale de Temoin is held in place by magic.", "Did you know that the Chapel in Docktown was burnt down some years ago, but they never found out who did it. The brave whisper it was a masked rat, but no one dares put name to the culprit.", "The Docktown chapel used to be the centre of worship, and no one seems to know how or when it burnt down. Now the Rinaldi and the Bisclavret are trying to both take the credit for it's reconstruction.", "Didn't you notice hwo something seemed amiss when the Chapel was rebuilt? There were people entering the construction site during the darkest of the night.", "They say that scary things were hidden inside the Chapel when it was rebuilt.", "Sir Lyam, one of the Bisclavret knights, once turned red he was yelling so hard at a higher ranked Bisclavret, right in the middle of the commons. He seemed to think that his own personal honor was more important than the honor of his house. Maybe that's why he was called away, and put right on the border of Bisclavret lands, near the Phelan.", "The Chevernaise, the house of goats, refuse to acknowledge the authority of any of the Great Houses and might secretly be working for the downfall of the order as it is now. They often ambush caravans that move through their pass to the northeastern port.", "I wonder why that horse mister Clover opened up a jewelery business, is there really so much money in it or is he just out to impress the ladies?", " It's very easy to send a message to someone. The couriers in the Commons and up by the waterfall in New Town are most helpful and will give you a scroll or piece or parchment if you ask them nicely. They'll also deliver the scrolls for you, just remember to address them.", "There was a cat that was arrested, and ate the body of someone that was in the cells with her. Bet she was Phelan or something.", " Miss Danae executed the cannibal slave, Damia. She was caught and brought in by Mister Geradan, Miss Rhea and Mister Rowf.

Skeletons and zombies were pouring out, spawns from hell, maiming and killing innocent people standing by!", "Miss Meepers’ demon was vanquished by Mister Clayton and a band of helpers on the thirtieth of Strawberry, 888 Apres le Miracle. There was a gate to hell and everything in the middle of Docktown!", "Dio Goldengate, that's a name you can't avoid hearing at some point in Triskellian. He's started several guilds and is engaged in many businesses. I think he's trying to become a merchant prince, or does he have other intentions, some spoke of nobility when they mentioned his name once.", "If you want to get hold of some precious metal or beautiful diamonds for cheap, then you better be very nice around the boars. The Doloreaux mines deliver the most beautiful metal and gems on the entire continent.", "Never taunt a boar I warn you, they're the nastiest minded of all the people on the continent.", "The Doloreaux are in a stalemate because they're surrounded by rival houses. Since they have only enough farmland for subsistence, their holdings have no room to grow and therefore their leaders have chosen to expand their power through material wealth. To their great regret that means dealing with the Guilds of Triskellian.", "The Capitol of the Doloreaux is Bruges.", "Have you heard how the boars submit to the rules of women? They decide who can marry and who can not, what to plant on fields and when to go to war against whom. That's a scary thought that a woman should hold so much power.", "The Great Mother is the secret head of the Lutarist faith, and the true power behind the Ducal throne of Tybault de Doloreaux. I do wonder who she is to control the nobility.", "The Don had to borrow money from a commoner to finance his wedding to a foreign princess, Queen Amalsand Jakoba. It seems the Rinaldi nobles are not as well of as they pretend to be.", "If you're thirsty, then try the two taverns. The Severed Tail and the Turret Tavern serve both juice, beer, ale, mead and what no. I'm sure you can sate your thirst there.", "It's interesting to see how many colours you can come up with if you start to mix the dyes. I've seen the most odd variations. You should try yourself.", "Did you hear that Miss Sonyara Linlae married Mister Fips on the first day of thunder, 888 Apres le Miracle in the Cathedrale de Temoin. They also set up the Linlae Gardening Guild as a family guild.", "Down by the docks is a merchant who'll sell you fishing poles and nets if you want to fish in the bay. It's a lot easer to catch something if you're using tools to help you.", "There was this mighty pirate, who used to steal everything that wasn't nailed down and sell it back to people on the black market. He was a rabbit named Flynn, and he got out of trouble by being friends with Mister Joshua. Mister Geradan was the master of the tops on his ship, and now sails in Admiral Flynn's fleet.", "You can find some delicious food in the tavern in the Boarding House. There are drinks too. If you're up for a desert, then try and find the apple tree down by the bay. Most of the time it has enough for everyone.", "It is rumored that there is a game that might just cost an arm and a leg to play in the faire situated in Helloise Way.", "Some said that it was following many violent outbreaks that the gates to New Town was closed to most serfs, this served to protect the nobles that lived within the area. I've heard though that the Constabulary had other reasons for their actions.", "There is rumored to be a hidden sanctuary somewhere in Docktown, a garden of sorts. They say it is hidden behind thick curtains of vines and that they will only part if you know how to sway them. I my self have never seen this heavenly place but many say it is a place to hide. Is it safe, do you think? Or perhaps it is a thieves' den.", "Mister Gus once opened a magic jar and was thrown into jail for doing it by the Constabulary. You should ask him one day what was in that jar to make it such a big deal.", "A while back the Avoirdupois tried to fold the Hands of St. Trahern in under their house, gaining control of one of the most powerful and strong guilds in the city. They didn't succeed, but the Bisclavret had their fingers in the guild too and stole their most skilled jeweler. Mister Bruno wasn't too pleased with all that.", "Many years ago Helloise wandered through the streets of Triskellian, curing all whom she touched in the same way. She walked from house to house for five days, healing all whom she could. Exhausted she prayed to have her life taken in return for healing the city and S'allumer granted her the wish and so was the entire city rescued from the plague.", "You can buy flowers and essential oils in the herb shop. The prices are a bit steep I think, but if you get some gardeners to help you, you might get some nicer flowers in return.", "The polar bear Ian attacked this wolf for no reason, apparently because his parents were killed by white wolves. Sir Burcet had him flogged, and sent to war.", "Rumor has it that there's a secret passage to help escape the cells in the gaol. But no one's ever got through it alive. At least, I  never heard of any.", "Did you see how the zombies seem to emerge from the ground. It makes me wonder if there might be some secret cave beneath Docktown.", "A few years ago there was this deer who liked hiring whores to beat up on them. He liked doing it in front of people to rile them up, think his name was Mister Kino. He's left the town since, someone once whispered to me that he was killed for it on Mistress Luna's orders.", "Dark magic has been used to create all those zombies. It's just odd that none of the graveyards have been robbed lately.", "Have you seen that Mister Kittybart hangs out down by the docks fishing. If you ask him he will be willing to sell your fish for you, I heard he gets a good price. It seems the monger likes him. She should, he is down there enough.", "Zombies have been running around in the city infesting it and killing people. A scary thing, don't you agree? How come there are undead here in the first place? That requires a necromancers or demon I believe.", "The Bisclavret has been thriving. Mister Koda, who’s the last of his pack, the Azure family joined them where he found his skills as a soldier well suited.", "There was a Zeiss Company teacher that was killed, his head was chopped off most brutally they say. Whispers have it that Mister Grimclaw, Mister Lucius and Miss Dazrene did the deed and that the Bisclavret Knight, Sir Lyam covered it up. Mister Grimclaw took most of the fall, but no one except the four of them know what actually happened or why.", "So, Miss Leah has a bounty on her head. Apparently she upset the Lissemantea. Good thing she's in a Rinaldi city now, wouldn't you agree? Though I did hear she was shot dead by a professional assassin.", "The Legionaries used to be a large and powerful army in Triskellian. They were composed of mercenaries and soldiers and tried to help Docktown. They were disbanded by the Rinaldi because their leader Roofus Black was thought to have been raising an enemy army on Rinaldi soil. ", "Mister Xavios was a part of the Blacks when they where a fearsome group. He then watched in dismay as they crumbled slowly, and now he returned to become a Bisclavret, following the nature of his race. He started his career in Triskellian as a guard for the Rinaldi though, and one can speculate if he might still hold some favor towards the foxes.", "The White Rose was a guild led by two ermine brothers of the Lissemanteau House. They were exiled after a botched attempt at over throwing the Rinaldi House.", "Mister Xavios has been through many wars in his time. He settled in Triskellian and became a guard for the Rinaldi, where he received a special sword after preventing bath satchels full of Noble's clothing and Items to be stolen. Don’t come here and say the foxes aren’t generous when it suits them.", "Did you ever hear about Mister Vulpes the Rinaldi fox who attacked and killed a slave and his master? They say he hid the bodies before he was finally captured and took his own life.", "There's a secret grove for Lutara worshipers in the city. Look for a wall of vines, perhaps if you're lucky you will be let in.", "Did you know that it is forbidden to write down the secret ways of Lutara. That there are no bibles or pamphlets to circulate, and even the printing of the Carmina Clarimundae does not meet with approval of the devout hierarchs. But, by contrast, the penitents of S'allumer encourage literacy and the spreading of the printed word, especially of the miracles of Helloise and the marvels of White Magic.", "Sir Lyam's devotion and love to Miss Dazrene was revealed when her throat was ripped out and Sir Lyam had her resurrected and kissed her on the altar. They say that miss Basanti, later Bishop, witnessed it and fled the room since she also had a romantic interest in Sir Lyam.", "Nobles tend to surround themselves with bodyguards and servants, so if you're looking for that sort of work, you should contact members of the houses. They're usually recognized by their colorful cloaks.", "Commoners tend to gather in the Commons outside the Severed Tail to talk and meet with friends and business associates. The great shade oak is a favorite resting place and the courier on duty next to the Chapel makes it a convenient spot to spend your evening.", "The Maison was run by Mistress Luna for a long while, it was one of those places you know where you can buy pleasure. Now they're saying they're rebuilding it to become some sort of fancy place, quite proper and appropriate too.", "Ceylas Café is a cozy and inviting place filled with strong scents of grounded coffee beans and the sweet smell of tea. It's often used to conduct business meetings and is a favourite place to sit and relax by the nobles.", "The best port on all of Calabria is found in Triskellian. Just ask the Bisclavret who tried to create their own ports of trade and commerce. That didn't go so well, but from what I've heard, they've not quite given up yet.", "Sometimes I'm surprised how some of the noble houses can afford all those luxuries they’re buying? Do they really earn so much on their resources or is there something else going on?", "It's forbidden to trade and duel on Dimanche's.", "Mister March has once worked as guard for the Rinaldi, but got a religious calling and became a holy warrior for the church. I do wonder what happened to make that change.", "Did anyone tell you that prior to becoming a paladin for the Church of S’allumer, Mister March saw a number of what he claimed were miracles.", "They said that Miss Meepers makes the best clothes in the city. Of course, that's no surprise considered she made that deal with a demon to achieve her high skills. Luckily the demon was banished to Hell.", "The Captain of the Constabulary had a cute white panther as his girlfriend. When she was killed he turned crazy and tore the city upside down. He used all the power he could and inflicted strict rule upon Docktown. That's the real reason the gates to New Town was closed for a long while.", "Rumours abound that buildings in the older parts of Triskellian are far older than any modern history book. One thing is certain though; the foxes founded the city and own it… still.", "The nobles are trying to recruit as many commoners to aid their cause, and to be loyal to them. You can never be sure of what guild is infected with those spies. Be careful, or be strong and independent.", "There are two merchants who'll sell you some dye and cloth so you can make clothes. It's helpful if you're a trader though. That way you can bargain for better materials for the same price.", "You do know that the visiting nobles from the other houses aren't too happy about the fact that it is actually commoners who control Triskellian. But what can they do I ask you? If they want the trade, they have to work with us, wouldn't you agree?", "Triskellian is the only city in all of Calabria that has guilds independent of the noble houses. Of course the foreign noble houses are trying to gain control, and the Rinaldi are also known to have used their influence to further own interests. But the guilds are strong and most of the times manage to fight of the influence which makes them open to all forms of trade.", "Merchants are really sought after in the city.  People who know how to bargain will receive a nice salary if they make their skills known. Everybody wants those good quality things instead of the bad stuff they can trade for.", "Did you hear about the slave Mulgim who killed the child Caitriona in the Commons after holding her hostage? I wonder where did he get his sword and what he said to her? He spoke only in wolf, and the only person that could understand knows he called her Princess a few times.", "There were whispers of a group called the 'Peace Keepers.' Only a few know who they are or what they did but I know this; their name was said when Mister Kaze was about.", "Do you have dreams of rising high as a merchant prince? Then you've come to the right city, Triskellian is famous for its trade and guilds and for an industrious individual there's always opportunity to gain great riches and respect.", "There's good fishing down by the docks if you need to earn a bit of money. If you're just hungry, then find the apple tree in the small park down by the bay. They taste delicious.", "I've heard there are quite a few treasures hidden around in the city. There is gold and sapphires, silver and emeralds, money, weapons and what not. All it takes is a keen eye to go look for it; you can make a life's worth of fortune that way if you're lucky!", "There's trade going on in Triskellian all the time! You should see the auctions, commoners and nobles alike bid on them and the prices on the good stuff tend to go up when they compete about getting the things. It can be really fascinating, if you're interested in trade that is.", "The thieves have their secret lair down in the sewers. Not many can go there though. There are secret passages and locked doors. Though, if you do find it, be careful and hope there are no thieves at home. If not, then you might find quite a bit of treasure hidden away.", "Queen Morfessa, a Phelan ruler gained her throne not only by proving her skills to lead many campaigns against their foes, but also as a testament to her ability, she is unscathed by the horrors of the battlefield. She's a great inspiration to many Phelan females who are fierce upon the battlefield as well as strong willed outside of it.", "Of all the lands controlled by the Phelan, the lands of Oithir are the most desired. The forests grow thick and lush with stout wood, next to fish-stocked rivers. It's just a shame that they're bordered by troubles, to the northeast by the Doloreaux, and southeast by the Bisclavret.", "I saw one of the ZSC enforcers interrogating a cat about something. They looked pretty rough.", "I hear Master Zeiss has posted a big reward for whoever tells him who the escaped slave is.", "Did you hear the rumor that an escaped slave is living here in Triskellian amongst us normal people? I hope they catch him!", "You know how it's said that two different species can't breed with each other. I tell ya, it's possible. You just need to find a sorcerer; they can cast spells so they can conceive.", "I hear that the Zeiss Slaving Company is searching Triskellian for an escaped slave. If they can catch her, then they get to sell her on for full profit.", "If you happen down by the docks you should keep an eye out for those fishing there. I'm sure you'll find either Mister Kittybart, Mister Caelith, Mister Clover or Mister Gus down there trying to make a fortune fishing. Perhaps they’ll be willing to share a few tips with you.", "One of Baron Reyaurd d'Avoirdupois' servants brought a notice about an escaped slave. They think it fled here.", "Mister Fips and Misses Sonyara is a very cute couple. He's really good with flowers too, so find him if you want a little garden in your window sill.", "You find the best ale in the Turret Tavern, not to mention the barmaid up there. Uhmm.", "I heard a very scary rumor the other day. I dare barely tell you, it's so scary, at least if it's true. Someone murmured that the Queen works with dark magic and is a threat to the entire city!", "If you die there’s a possibility to be brought back. You just have to be well enough liked by the Priests of S'allumer. They know how to work white magic that'll resurrect you.", "Lord Mercutio is the Rinaldi Trade Envoy. Just talk to him if you want special things imported into the city, he can get hold of everything you can dream of.", "You’re interested in trading? Well, you've certainly come to the right city then! The Rinaldi are renowned for their trade skills and contacts. They can get hold of anything, or at least, they know who'll sell it.", "I heard that you can find the most amazing things out in the swamps. But be careful, horrible beasts live there, not to mention the people, they certainly don’t like company and they dabble in magic too!", "The spruce bench found at the waterfalls edge in Peaceful Way was put there by Mister Garv so that Miss Sonyara could listen to the falling water whilst she was blind. Her blindness was later eased with the use of a monocle.", "Smugglers tend to hide their wares around in the city to avoid the law discovering what they're up to. On the black market you'll be able to find some of the more seedy things, if you're not lucky and run across one of the hidden crèches. Just be careful with that sort of riches, they might come after you.", "If you have skills with a hammer and forge, then you should head down to the smithy and use the anvil down there. There's even a merchant who'll sell you some iron so you can get started.", "If you're in need of a bit of coin and are fast, then kill some skinks and sell them to the courier or traders, they'll offer you a bit for it. When I was younger that was an easy way to earn for an ale.", "The assassin group the Shadows used to be a large assassin group lead by mysterious assassins. Their main base was set up in Docktown and they were responsible for many of the murders that terrified the citizens. Their empire of tyranny collapsed due to the actions of the Legionaries. ", "The sewer exits into the bay. It's pretty smelly there.", "Come closer; let me tell you a secret. There's a hidden entrance to the sewers in the warehouse. You just have search the floor for a hidden trapdoor.", "Can you keep a secret? The noble houses are on decline, they're losing more and more power I tell you. Some of the things I've seen the last few years are plain scary. Before we know of it, the guilds will be ruling the city and we'll no longer have a don!", "Scorpia was a new and rather large group of assassins brought into Docktown and challenged many of the other assassin guilds to prove that they were the best. Their empire quickly collapsed due to their competitive status with the other assassin guilds. It is led to believe that they all fell due to one assassin lord code named Blade.", "The Capitol of the Rinaldi is Triskellian.", "Let me tell you a secret, see the founder of the Rinaldi dynasty, Jon the Wise, knew something of the Autarch's magics and he may have been one of their lineal descendants. ", "Did you hear that Mister Roofus once was arrested for calling himself a king? The Rinaldi said he was breaking the law.", "Sir Lyam, one of the Bisclavret knights, wasn't born in civilized areas. He was a Phelan, who abandoned their savage ways, and embraced civilization. Or so he wanted people to think, there are those disputing it greatly.", "It is said that Valentin recruited several people into the Sailors Guild in an attempt to gain control over Triskellian. Some of his closer friends like Gemma and Nix might have been in on it, secretly working for the criminal guild while appearing loyal to their houses", "Have you heard of Sir Guy? No. Neither has anyone else. Not since he married... his wife. Be sure you don't mention this so-called knight to the Avoirdupois.", "Lord Eberhard was much favored by Bruges, ever since he married a Bisclavret noble, and gain influence over a significant amount of their land. I wonder what those two houses are up to now.", "They say that many slaves are being freed by unknown benefactors. That some are even getting married. A select few have been known to marry into noble blood. But you know, I've ever only heard of one slave being freed, that horse Rocher.", "A slave once stabbed a free citizen. The slave had good reason, really good reason... but was still hung for it. Slaves just can't be allowed to do stuff like that. They're not real people after all.", "Sir Matteo got in trouble from the church, for telling a priest he can't go into the chapel while it was haunted. Wow! Don't question the Church's authority on church matters like that! Not even the Rinaldi could protect Sir Matteo, he had to run around like an errand boy doing chores for the church until they forgave him, else he would have been demoted.", " I hear that Scudiero Brumble, while counting who is a member of the guild council, would only count votes from members who had paid their council fees... but would also count votes from members who hadn't paid fees yet, if they were voting for the outcome Brumble wanted. ", "So, when it comes to buying clothes, you've got two options. You can buy clothes that are called 'Rags' - ugh! How disgusting! Or you can buy clothes from someone with a questionable past and no sense of color matching. Can't someone provide a third option, please?", "Bruno, the blacksmith, has one of the most organized guilds in the city. He has many different products for sale, all with varying costs based on material... and yet everyone who visits his shop can easily find what they want and figure out the price easily. (OOC: his @guild page has very impressive pricing lists)", "Did you hear that Valentin once was a member of the constables. Then he decided to start his own business, spending his time on that instead of his work. Without asking anyone for permission. No wonder they didn't want him back! ", "Araceli is a fox, but I hear that she claims she's of Bisclavret blood. I wonder if she thinks that her tail is just fluffy from too many washes?", "Could it be true? I hear Lucius is back in town. I hope not, I think it's safer when he's not around.", " Alessa is a raccoon that used to run the Sailors guild. She left town very quickly one night, and Lucius took over. I wonder what Lucius did to make her run so fast.", "Hear that Lucius left town without warning? Returned months later, half dead... and most of his face has been burnt off.

Poor form!", "Even though Braxton is the son of both Lord Twyrch and Baroness Kenina, he has been seen entering the tailor shop filching on the clothing in the racks reserved for the poor and new. You'd think he was well provided for!", "The arrogance of some people! That Sang, especially. I hear he decided it was his right to break up a picnic and ruin several people's afternoons simply because they decided to have a friendly sparring match while enjoying their time in the meadow. He just walked right in like he owned the place, throwing objects and insults, demanding that everyone stop and concede to his always delusional whims. Just because he's some University so-and-so doesn't mean he's better than anyone else. Someone should tell him that! Oh wait .. I'm telling him that.", "It seems Lord Twyrch has done a wonderful job raising his son, Braxton, and that the boy is eager to follow in his father's diplomatic footsteps. Prelate Theressa called upon young Braxton to discuss concerns over the behavior of some of the Bisclavret craftsmen. She was very pleased with his handling of the situation, calling him prompt, efficient, diplomatic, and graceful.", "That boar Knight Sir Erwin doesn't know much about gratitude. A fellow boar tried to get him to go along to help out a failing village and he simply turned it down.", "Miss Aneira did a wonderful job in hosting the dinner party, and she made the Bisclavret house very proud.", "Whilst in the commons, mister Cullan was overheard forcing his opinion on a reluctant mister Giles on what is and isn't appropriate in terms of service to the Constabulary. He was speaking as a member of the militia, whose sole purpose is to take up arms against criminals, but that's not entirely what the Constabulary is about. As Giles was sticking up for himself, Cullan also decided to chide miss Odessa on waving about a naked blade despite that he was hypocritically carrying an exposed rapier himself. Get your facts straight, wolfie!", "I heard that Cullan was repeatedly insulting during a conversation he was having with mister Giles about the Constabulary, and when he was informed of this and requested to apologize, he proceeded instead to repeat the insult twice more, and threaten him! Either he's too stupid to follow a simple conversation, too arrogant to admit his mistakes, or he's an abusive brute.", "Lady Georgianna ran a small social and did so with grace, despite that someone faceplanted into a pie.", "Lady Georgianna wasted no time arranging a social upon her return to town. The turn out was great and the company enjoyable for such little planning.", "Mister Chinco kindly offered fresh, hand-picked strawberries to everyone in the commons. What a breath of fresh air!", "Fyros was rumored to be busily running in and out of the commons, rudely throwing scrolls at the poor, overworked courier, all while blatantly ignoring everyone else present even though he was greeted several times. Apparently busy mercenaries have no time to return pleasantries, and likely they're trained in poor manners. What a horrible trade skill.", "That bat, Achlys, sure can keep a cool head. She even managed to patch up Deacon Ximen -while- he was burning a heretic! Talk about skill .. woh.", "Don't make any arrangements with Doctor Hush. She takes loyal friends and discards them when they are no longer useful to her. She'll make vows and arrangements for instruction and payments, for willing service, and totally pretend they never happened and threaten to blacklist them for inquiring about the status of said arrangements. Next, she might send them a scroll, saying she doesn't even want any correspondence to discuss the situation like civilized people would, but will instead make threats via the courier that one simple query is cause for a blacklisting. Can a person become more hostile or arrogant and totally dismiss all discussion and arrangements previously agreed upon?", "That arrogant young Braxton started a scene with a loyal Bisclavret guardsman about nothing. Seems mister Viktor and young Pepper have known each other for years, and are basically siblings, but that didn't stop Braxton from berating him and insulting his honor, accusing him of gross misconduct and bringing shame to the House. He drummed Viktor right out of a job, right then and there! Little Pepper was only sitting on his shoulders, like she always does! I don't know if being the son of a Noble gives that entitled twerp authority over all of House Bisclavret, but he sure seems to think it does.", "People might not generally care, but Hush was in public, in the west commons, referring to people as twats in the crowd. Even though it's amusing, it's not very appropriate for a gentry member, is it?", "Did you hear that? Apparently Fyros lied straight to Achlys' face saying Hush said he was allowed to learn medic from her despite being outside the University guild. When Lys checked up with her boss this was in fact not true at all. Then he cussed Hush in the middle of the commons for calling him out! What a twat!", "Mister Fyros openly spoke out against Doctor Hush, a woman of rank that is held in high regard by most, if not all, of the city, and in the commons! He called her all sorts of horrid names and it was really mean and hateful. For shame, mister Fulke, for shame!", "Miss Nan took the time to not only write and direct a wonderful play for the city, but she included a valuable lesson in the script itself -- that every action has a consequence. In this case, we learned the valuable lesson that taking grains impairs one's judgement - sometimes fatally.", "Miss Nan wrote and organized a play which turned out to be a big success. You have to admire the dedication and hard work such an endeavor requires.", "When telling newcomers about his guild, mister Chesh freely advertises that he doesn't care whether the jobs he gets hired to do are legal or not, he's just happy to do them. For an indentured servant, he isn't very smart, is he?", "Lady Georgianna held a social get-together which everyone was invited to. There were fresh strawberries, drinks, chocolate, pie, and good company. She went out of her way to arrange for something to happen during a time when hardly anything has been happening at all. Even the room was decked out in pretty streamers, with everything in its place and a place for everything! She should be commended for attempting to provide regular socials that anyone can come and enjoy.", "Good on Nan for writing her own play, and what dedication too for finally managing to present it in the theatre form after three whole years of trying, waiting, and disappointment. She paid for all of the equipment, including furniture, clothing, and stage props. Congratulations for all your hard work paying off.", "Alfio volunteered to take part in Nan's play as the creepy, feminine spider. Despite his difficult and apparent inability to portray a female effectively, it all worked out to give the play a humorous edge. Well done!", "As one accustomed to being proper at all times, mister Kaine managed to let loose a little and dress up as a crate slash dewdrop slash Constable for Nan's play. He may have accidentally turned toward the exit whilst blinded beneath the box, but it all added to the light-heartedness of the theatre. Good work!", "Alma managed to conquer her stutter so that she could play a lead role in Nan's play, which shows just how much work she was willing to put towards a good and fun cause!", "Usually shy, Rylen did fantastic playing a feminine flower in Nan's play, Pink! He was a good sport wearing a dress which couldn't have been more fluttery and girlish if it tried.. Personally, I don't think I could have let loose as many tears on the stage in front of so many people if I tried! Good going, skunk boy.", "Looks like the Bisclavret Lady is slumming it in the commons yet again. Not only that, but with LePlow of all people. They've been spending quite a bit of time behind closed doors together.", "Kaine has served the Bisclavret with every breath in his body. Even when Lord Twyrch and his posse of fools came along and forced Kaine to take the position of Reeve, he handled it with nothing but grace and respect.", "Ambassador Kaine has handled the current change in power within the Bisclavret very well and has continued to represent his House with honor and integrity while those around squander their chance at making the House better. Good on him for being such a good sport and allowing those less capable a chance to try their hand at running things.", "Mister Adon got Baron Marcus' sister out of a foreign house before it blew up and to safety. He followed orders intelligently and without delay and did a good job. He's a handy fellow to have as your friend!", "Mister Adon silenced the man calling for Xena's death below deck when her ship was in a violent storm and he believed it was bad luck due to her being a woman. Adon opened his throat as a warning to other mutinous crew, and it worked beautifully. Murder isn't always the best option, especially without the Captain's permission, but treason and mutiny only have one sentence, and Adon wasn't shy in carrying it out.", "Without any provocation, Chesh instigated an argument between himself and Una, with Chinco supporting him in an attempt to gang up by bringing up the case against Sir Bayard for requesting someone bow to him in Newtown. Chesh called Una an 'ass kisser of Nobles' for siding with Sir Bayard on what is and isn't expected in Newtown, picking on her while she was conveniently present. When it came to apologizing to her as a serf, Chesh accused her of ass kissing again, only without the use of curse words, which didn't retract the insult whatsoever. Shame, shame.", "The good Doctor Rose was quite insistent about talking with Lady Georgianna about a private medical procedure in the middle of the Docktown commons, despite the Lady's request to discuss it at a later time. The Doctor even attempted to pressure her into getting the aforementioned procedure done, amidst the many inquisitive glances of the people loitering nearby. She should know better than to speak about such private matters so openly, especially when they concern the Nobility of the city.", "Rumor has it that Prelate Theressa wishes to promote Clover. Is she completely oblivious to the fact that he is a Lutaran?", "Gabrielle is hinting at using her newspaper as a weapon against the entire Great House of Bisclavret, after she was insulted by the Captain of the Guard, mister Cullan. Why not follow the socially acceptable course of action and request an honorable duel to defend the honor of the Avoirdupois? Where is her fiance in this to defend her personal honor? Or do the Horses no longer have any, and resort to media gossip to showcase their 'virtues'? If I were them, I would be utterly ashamed.", "Miss Olive took it upon herself to implore an individual to try and force a newcomer to eat his used food. Perhaps pointing the newly arrived to the fresh fruit by the docks which is free might have been a better idea?", "Mister Prezzle was said to have tried to force a half-eaten pancake into the mouth of a newcomer against her will. Oh my, that's not the kind of welcome people look forward to.", "Upon hearing of miss Amaleigh's strange occurrence with mister Prezzle trying to force feed her against her will, mister Duncan furnished an acceptable apology from the individual on her behalf.", "Mill did outstanding work sailing Dame Xena's ship, and is a solid and dependable guard willing to do anything to help a mission succeed. She represents the Horned Halo well (whatever that is).", "What a father! Biggs carried, delivered, and cared for ten baby mermaids as best as he could for weeks until he sought help from Dean Dylan to have them adopted by water spirits and given to their natural habitat.

He deserves to be commended for his bravery.", "Let me tell you about mister Braxton; he saw his parents tragically die when he was a little bear cub and his face was scared by the banditï¿½s blade.

They say that his talents are many and some are even seen as better than those of adults.", "Donï¿½t sail to the Broken Coast if you can avoid it. It's a hell to go through with whirlpools and unpredictable storms, reefs and shallow waters.

There was a gate to hell and everything in the middle of Docktown!", "Melissa, the nurse in the infirmary, told me the strangest thing the other day.  She says Hush was in there talking at Ryan.  What about?  I'm glad you ask.  She was telling the slave that he wasn't supposed to ask Clover and him and Hush.  And Ryan's not supposed to ask Lianaar either.  I don't know what that's all about, but it sure seems fishy.", "The Bisclavret has been thriving.

Just be careful with that sort of riches, they might come after you.", "I heard that you can find the most amazing things out in the swamps. But be careful, horrible beasts live there, not to mention the people, they certainly donï¿½t like company and they dabble in magic too!", "If you happen down by the docks you should keep an eye out for those fishing there.

         (\{ "Lord Eberhard was much favored by Bruges, ever since he married a Bisclavret noble, and gain influence over a significant amount of their land. I wonder what those two houses are up to now.", "Lutara? Shush, don't say \\"that name\\" so loud.", "Test.", "test2", "blah blah blah.", "cha cha cha.", "According to his employees, Veritas is an honest and open businessman.  Despite the efforts of certain Avoirdupois commoners to slander his name after leaving their service.", "If you ask anyone in Veritas' camp, that Brenner is a downright rude fellow who unreasonably pursued the fact that Veritas was able to get his hands on steel without going through the Avoirdupois.", "I heard two enforcers chattering about that slave Ryan.  He's so insolent and disobedient that he punched Flynn right in the mouth!  When will that slave be put down for good?", "You won't hear most people admit to this, but I'm glad that Flynn is around to keep the slaves in line.  Even if he's brutal and maybe a bit too much for my tastes.", "That Doctor Hush.  She's so very good and generous, always willing to teach people about the arts of medicine.  Maybe she is Helloise in mortal form?", "That Temperance.  I don't know why she was excommunicated from mother church, but I do know that that's not the sort of person I want to associate with.", "I heard that Hush annulled Ryan's marriage to Gemma.  Regardless of legal rights the blatant disregard for the sanctity of marriage is disconcerting.  Though one is left to wonder... what kind of person marries a slave in the first place?", "Rhea seems to be really loyal.  She stood up for Sang without hesitation.  That's the kind of friend I want.  Of course, that body doesn't hurt my wanting her as a friend either.", "You heard the word on Peaceful Way?  Apparently Esquire Brooks acted as a diplomatic go-between for Sir Althalus and Lord Edmond on a sensitive sensitive political situation.  Apparently the Doloreaux asked Brooks to clear up whether Rhea was asking people to blacklist the Doloreaux on behalf of the Avoirdupois or not.  When will both of those Great Houses lay down their arms and embrace each other as they have embraced S'allumer?", "That Wynter is certainly kind. She helps folks with establishing themselves here and style them to look the part of a gentleman or lady. Such generosity reflects well on her and the House Rinaldi.  Though sometimes, she just gives me the googly mooglies, nobody can be that nice all the time!", "That Lidia is all about being vengeful and spiteful.  I saw her right up to a newcomer and assault his lips while she was pregnant no less -and- in the company of her beau.  If you ask me, she's just an overly dramatic floozy.  Though you also have to ask about a man who can't keep his woman in line.", "I have it on good authority that Flynn was the one behind pushing for the annulment of Ryan's marriage.  Truthfully!  Not only is he brutal, he's heartless to boot!  Oh that poor Ryan, what is a slave to do if he cannot find love with a free woman?", "That Adonis, he's such a helpful fellow.  He has been running around giving elabaorate, rational and chronological explanations of the events that transpired when a fleet sailed to rescue Lady Theressa.  Helpful, polite, answering proper questions and sticking to the protocol while doing so.  Such a good chap.", "That Geradan, always putting his personal feelings first.  Like when he risked the safety of an Avoirdupois noble!  Apparently she was held by pirates of some sort, went to parley with them when told not to and even argued with the scoundrels!  It's a wonder she returned safely!", "Rumor says during the Avoirdupois mission to safe Lady Theressa, he was more interested in fishing up treasures from the see and wreck, than actually on the work he was tasked with.  How can a man like this be trusted with anything important?!", "That Clover!  What can I say?  Always so generous, even to complete strangers!  He gave a newcomer twelve whole denarii!  For no reason whatsoever!  That's the sort of fellow we need more of in Docktown.", "Have you ever met someone more ready to help someone who needs clothes or directions than Brie?  Just the other day she pointed some fool who walked right past the bank in the right direction.  Patience and kindness, what a combination.", "Another kind person in Docktown.  Ramsford, the fisherman I think, is very welcoming to people who are clueless about their surroundings.  I'd look up to him as someone I could rely on.", "Have you heard about Rhea?  Apparently folks are patting her on the back for keeping calm about something, when she could have very well gutted someone and landed herself in jail!  I heard this was good for the Houses and one of Newtown's universities too, but I've no idea why.", "Oh Lord Edmond!  You should hear the ladies talk!  How chivalrous and romantic, sailing off to rescue your true love! It's a rarity in men these days to act with such bravery when unknowing of what the result will be, or the state of their companion. It's nice to see that some values are maintained by Nobility, and that some still strive to set an example for those of lower station.  He's sooo dreamy!", "Have you heard about a chap by the name of Virendra?  Apparently he enjoys tricking people into eating and drinking food items he keeps in his codpiece.  How repulsive can you be?  And he's supposed to be a businessman people can come to with requests when they need assistance?  The shame of it all.", "I heard a group of gentry talking about the Doloreaux and their servant Senora.  Apparently the pigs' smell is rubbing off on her with all of the time she has spent in their service.  According to my sources, some people think they should be removed from the city immediately!", "That Esquire Brooks!  He's a right proper gentleman.  Being a good escort and paying attention to the conversation, engaging in the actual topic and remembering the proper etiquette, as an Avoirdupois should.  Any maiden would be lucky to have his attention.", "Captain Carlon, how heroic!  He's always willing to save women in need for deadly barrels of liquid while they're wearing a gown.  Such a good captain.", "Have you heard about Aysun, Xena and Wynter?  That went to a lot of trouble to ensure was properly arranged and tended to.  Providing a chance for the upstanding singles in the town to meet with prospective partners in an elegant, yet socially acceptable, environment.", "Miss Faile, what can I say?  Who'd have thought a slaver would rise to the standards of society and dress up for a formal event?", "Sir Brumble is always good about etiquette and observing propriety.  He does wonderful introductions for people in formal social settings according to rank and so on.  If it weren't for those quills, I'd say he deserved a big hug!", "Xena put a lot of effort into ensuring all the guests were cared for at the party, offering and arranging drinks, and the like.  And I hear she did much of the organization.  Now if only she were a slave, I'd buy her in a minute.", "Ryan brought a fiddle to provide entertainment at the recent ball.  For all his behavioral problems, he didn't punch or stab anyone.  I was as surprised as you!", "Depending on who you ask, Miss Aysun did the majority of the organizing of the singles social and was a most gracious, organized hostess.  Also depending on who you ask, she wanted to throttle half the guests, but you didn't hear that from me.", "You know that singles social?  Well guess what?  A few people found her demeaning the social expectations in public and before commoners a bad example.  Apparently Sheriff Joshua was an instigator.  But who cares?  She's an aristocrat, she should know better!", "Despite instigating Esquire Lilandra to behave badly at the singles social, he at least hinted that perhaps being introduced by a third party would be more appropriate instead of just walking up to a stranger to talk.  Maybe he isn't such a worthless pile as many people think.", "Apparently the slave Ryan's fingers are made of steel.  He played his fiddle for so long... any other person's fingers would've fell off!  How very spirited of him.", "You know who Cork is?  Yeah.  You know who Sunta is?  Yeah.  Apparently he asked her to dance and she refused him!  Not that -I- blame her.  Probably crushed his poor little heart in the process.", "Like I've said before, Sunta didn't want to dance with Cork at the ball.  He's not a catch, but she could at least have been sociable enough to indulge him.  He might not have groped her in the process.", "Cork made a real effort to invite people to dance at the ball.  Even the ugly girls I'm told.  For being a bit on the... not-so-pleasant looking side himself, that's a winner in my book!", "Sang made a real effort to dance with everyone at the ball!  Especially the wallflowers.  He was charming and graceful and... almost womanly, come to think of it.  He's still aces to me though!", "Who invited Cork to that ball anyway?  I heard some gals chattering on about how he was leering at them in a most inappropriate fashion.  You'd think the organizers would have known better.", "Loki. A paragon of masculinity and military inclinations. He still danced at the ball! Who'd have thought he was capable? I was soooo surprised!", "That Rinaldi maid, Wynter, she's a real go getter!  Pulled the decorations for the ball together at the last minute!  And all by herself no less!  What a fantastic helper.", "Even if she did help with the last minute decorations at the social, Wynter also bailed out on getting the main foyer properly decorated once the tables were there.  For shame!  FOR!  SHAME!", "When you think of chivalrous gentlemen, you should think of Esquire Brooks.  He must have nearly worn his hooves off dancing with almost every woman who attended the recent ball.  I wonder where all of his stamina comes from, he's kind of scrawny.", "Did you hear that Viscountess Aedina played at the singles social?  How gracious of her.  And what's more, Xena made sure that everyone shut their pie holes so that she could be heard.  Now that's class!", "I heard some infirmary workers gossiping.  Doctor Jahren's a good chap, always helpful and in the infirmary.  Though that doesn't really excuse his showing up to a social without formal clothes, then blathering about how his assets were directed to better things.  What better things are there?  Cake?", "So apparently Jahren crashed a party, walking in with armloads of junk that he should have left somewhere else!  I guess someone though he was going to stab them with his scalpel.", "You heard?  I sure did.  Oh, what did I hear you ask?  Well... apparently Jahren crashed a party he wasn't formally invited to, not wearing something appropriate for the occasion and hauling around, what is rumored to be, all of his worldly possessions.  Invest in a trunk or something man!", "Lots of talk around town about Jahren.  He made quite the fuss at a recent social, coming uninvited, poorly dress and, and, and, bringing a guest who wasn't invited either!  And she was married!  And without her husband at her side!  FOR SHAME I tell you!", "Upstanding doctor, charitable man and apparently a party crasher too!  Oh Doctor Jahren, when will you learn?", "Despite her being demure and ladylike, I wouldn't want to ruin one of Esquire Aysun's parties.  Apparently she almost had some people kicked out of her last one!  Seriously, very scary.", "While she might not take kindly to people trying to ruin her social, at least she has the sense to not grab them by their collars and drag them out!  Aysun that is.  She did the right thing by hinting that the crashers weren't welcome instead.", "So Cork went to that fancy to do singles social, don't ask me why or how.  Apparently while dancing, he was rude to Esquire Brooks by not permitting him to cut in and dance with Cork's partner!  The gall of that man!  String him up by his neck I say!  I can't stand rudeness!", "Do you have any idea how much work goes into planning a social?  I was asking my brother's wife's sister's uncle's grandfather's third cousin about it.  And apparently that Aysun deserves a lot of respect for pulling it all together.", "Viscountess Aedina played for everyone at the ball, did you hear?  And her haunting voice accompanied her playing.  I talked to Lord So-and-So and he said he was one of the most enchanting performances he'd ever seen.", "I went to that ball the other night and I saw the slave Ryan.  He was well behaved, very surprisingly.  Whatever Hush is doing to keep him in line, it must be working.  Maybe she found something besides whips to beat him with.", "I'm almost sick of hearing about Aysun, that Bisclavret gentry.  But I'll tell you anyway, that she was most polite and not too generically nice to all the guests at the social.  If you ask those who attended.  Personally, I find her cold and aloof.  But my opinion doesn't count for much.", "Ever stopped to chat with that Cork guy?  Me either.  But if what I'm hearing about him is true, every last bit of his income goes to the church and the less fortunate!  Surely he'll be blessed by the Great Light for his charity.", "So I heard the other day, from some sailors who were passing by, that Doctor Jahren has been trying to boss around people he has no authority over.  Trying to make them do what he wants, even demeaning them in public!  Jealousy does not become you, my friend, you're a healer.  First do no harm!", "You probably don't need to hear about Clover's generosity, but just in case you do, he keeps flinging money at people to help them get started.  You gotta wonder... when is he going to run out of denarii?", "Faile went to a social, dressed up like a real woman and danced with some poor, unsuspecting fellow.  I snickered when I heard it too.  But at least she made an effort to fit into proper society.", "So Xena dressed Faile up for the recent social.  Fighting through the slaver's defenses must've been like trying to capture Chalon single-handed!  That Xena is so persuasive, though, I wonder how she gets everyone to do what she wants...", "I know she's a commoner.  And I know she's not that smart.  And I know about her reputation.  But still, what is Vajhira thinking, running through Docktown in nothing but her undergarments?  Even if she was swimming, in the middle of winter mind you... yeah, I laughed too, she still should have dressed herself again before wandering into the Severed Tail.", "Hahahahaha!  Listen to this!  Cork claimed that the lands of the Bisclavret, while impressive, are lacking in proper odor due to too many wolves being there.  Now I wonder what his homeland smells like, though I'm able to imagine seeing as he's a skunk and all.", "That Vajhira, she's just rude.  Doesn't bother to talk to anyone if she doesn't think she can take them up to... well, nevermind.  Still rude.", "I heard there was a lot of food left after the social, those nobles fill their bellies with more liquor than actual food, am I right?  Anyway, Esquire Aysun is apparently handing out the leftovers to anyone who wants some.  Generosity is to be smiled upon!", "Come here, let me tell you a story.  Sir Brumble sponsored Cork as a guest at the singles ball.  So what does Cork do?  He hassles the staff and servants for every bit of food he can get his hands on.  And not only does he not eat it, he stuffs it into his pouches and his shirt!  Maybe in the future, Sir Brumble will be more careful about who he invites next time.", "Noe is one of those Avoirdupois horses.  I hear she's so kind, she'll touch anyone's hair for free.  You wouldn't catch me touching most of the heads in Triskellian, that's for sure.", "So that Virendra, I think he's with the Sailor's guild, he's all about giving out free lessons in handling pain after he whacks people good in a spar.  Or elsewhere, depending who you ask.  I wonder how he goes about it... probably involves some things that are better left in private.", "Brooks'll tell ya, if you're at an event with peers, knights and gentry... even if you're a commoner, you don't dance cheek to cheek!  Nevernevernever!", "So I've been talking about being charitable a lot, haven't I?  Well Sir Althalus is downright charitable.  But it comes with a price.  Yon poor beggars in the streets and alleys might get a bit of coin off of him, sure, but you gotta listen to him go on and on and on about the Light and being concerned about the souls of other.  Crikey mate, they just need a hot meal, not a lecture.  But I'll admit, he's a good sort for bothering to give at all.", "The recent Single's Ball, lots of chatter about that.  I hear tell that it was originally the idea of Lord Marcus and Viscountess Kenina.  But they were just too lazy to figure everything out.  So they got Aysun to do it!  Good thing to, because she did a bang up job and is so modest about her role in the whole thing.  Gentry, who'd a thunk it?", "Senora is, I hear, one of the most senior Doloreaux commoners.  Served since forever and really loyal too.  And it's no wonder, she goes around hugging the boars like they're her best gal pals!  I don't know about you, but that's not something I'd expect to see out of a serious reeve-clerk-high up- position thingy like her.", "That Lucinda!  You haven't heard?  Apparently she's walk right up and lay one on whoever is standing around in the commons.  Depending on who you ask.  I know a few blokes who wouldn't mind meeting a gal like her.", "That Cork!  You haven't heard?  Apparently he'll walk right up and lay one on whoever is standing around in the commons.  Depending on who you ask.  I know a few gals who wouldn't mind meeting a bloke like him.", "Cork's a dirty, mongrel, yuck yuck yucky sort of guy.  But he carries S'allumer in his heart and wishes people the Light's blessing.  So I guess that counts for something.", "Geradan's really trying to get himself right in the eyes of the church.  But he still swore at service!  Right there in front of the Light and everyone!", "So I was talking to one of my chums the other day, and he was telling me about this gal Polgara.  I don't know if she's married to this bloke or anything, but she went right into a room of the boarding house with a man fitting Khagra's description!  And to top it all off, she was dressed like she was going to whip him!  Leather head-to-toe, hand to the Light!  Of course if he is her husband, ignore whatever I'm saying.", "You know Red?  Or Rhea?  Yeah, that's the one.  I done heard that she was jawing in the commons about finding a pretty girl for some fella.  Right there in front of everybody!  If you ask me, she should stick to keeping her thoughts to herself.", "Jarek's a downright fool if you ask me!  He's too open about his trying to woo women, never you mind the fact that he inspects them in a closer than proper way.  And I'm not just talking about their faces and personalities!", "That Chinco.  What a hoot.  Apparently he got sprayed by a skunk named Cork, completely by accident!  But that didn't stop Chinco by gum, he turned right around broke that bloke's nose.  It's the most I'd seen him say or do in... well, since the last time he hurt someone!", "Heard about Kolgrim?  Didn't think so.  I thought that he was a right respectable sort of scholar type.  But turns out, he's nothing but a scoundrel.  Drunkenly staggering around town, he openly told his current love interest, in public no less, that he cheats on her.  For shame!  How low can a man be to treat a poor woman like that?", "Bishop Basanti always gives the most lovely sermons.  But at her last one she mentioned to a crowd of nobles, gentry and commoners that she spends her days laying around in her pajamas eating cake!  That's not what you'd expect from someone preaching the Light's lessons, is it?  For shame!", "There's this gal who comes around every now and again by the name of Celia.  According to my best friend's doctor's barber's midwife's carpenter, she went ahead and slapped Virendra when he touched her behind!  That girl has spunk!", "Oh the antics of Docktown!  Listen to this here: Virendra went ahead and touched Celia's derriere, so she slapped him right across the face!  The catch?  He slapped her right back!  The nerve!  One of the constables was going to file charges against them both for minor assault until Sir Althalus stepped in.  He demanded that Virendra apologize, which he did.  A happy ending all around, wouldn't you say?  That Althalus has a good head on his shoulders.", "Lianaar's a kind and generous soul... depending on who you ask.  A new gentry woman had arrived in Triskellian and Lianaar offered to pay for clothing for the gentry out of her own pocket.  In a very discreet way as to not make the new miss seem embarrassed.  It's the sort of thing to make you think there's still hope that the Light's lessons are being taking ot heart.", "I heard some girls gossiping over at the Turret today, and they say that if you ask anyone, Sir Bayard is a true gentleman who carries himself just as a knight should. Polite, generous and helpful, he is an exemplar of chivalry and good decorum.", "That Senora certainly knows how to welcome new members of her House to Triskellian.  That is how you make a House grow.", "Bruno's a busy sort of guy, no doubt, and everyone is clambering for his attention.  I guess scrolls are too hard to write these days.  Anyway, he was talking to a client in the commons the other day and someone just kept interrupting him.  Wouldn't shut their mouth for love nor money.  But old Bruno, he suggested a new conversation should be continued only after his current discussion was complete.  Put them in their place, Bruno.", "I'm sure everyone knows just how big Virendra's mouth is.  It's no secret.  But when you go around interrupting the conversations of simple craftsmen, and I mean simple, it's bound to confuse the poor guy.  While the enthusiasm is flattering it's still rude.  Where have manners gone?  Out the window, that's where!", "I hear that Jahren, good man that he is or appears to be, has a tendency of first making sure he lands safely in a good place, before jumping from his current position.  But he always fails to ask about release from oaths.  It's no wonder bridges are burnt and some people consider him unreliable.  Oath breakers are not to be trusted.", "Not only did Jahren come uninvited to the single's social, but he brought the wife of someone else with him as company.  What a scandal!  Who brings a married woman to an event for singles?!  Seriously?!  I have no idea!", "You want to hear a dirty little secret?  I knew you did, come closer.  Apparently Jahren engages in blasphemous romantic adventures.  The biggest scandal being word getting around about it.  I always say, if you can't trust them, don't lay with them.  But that's just me.", "Instead of being understanding and explaining the right and wrongs of behavior in Triskellian, I heard that Hush snapped quite viciously at a newcomer who did not yet understand the rules of a big city.  Honestly?  Where is the understanding?", "I know I've said lots of bad things about that slave, Ryan.  Yeah he probably needs to be shot, stabbed or hung.  But when it comes to newcomers, he's pretty understanding.  Especially when commoners aren't.  Have the commoners' minds rotted with a feeling of superiority?  Don't they remember that we all started somewhere?  For shame, commoners, for shame.", "My mammy always told me, if there's a preacher preaching, you'd better look like you ain't sleeping.  Or else your soul will be condemned to the fiery pits of wherever.  But Edd, bless his heart, he doesn't mind taking a nap in the pews.  I hope Ximen doesn't catch him next time.", "I've got another funny about Eddy.  Apparently he was at service in the chapel, and he made some lewd comments.  Boy what I would give to be able to see the look on the ladies' faces.", "Not only does Eddy make lewd comments during sermons, but they're just raunchy enough to make women blush.  Outrageous!  Or stupendous, depending on your point of view.", "I feel for the Sheriff, I do.  It's hard to find good men to serve him.  But it doesn't excuse his man Loki from ignoring all forms of social etiquette and insulting men of good birth everywhere.  I have it on good authority that the dog in question said, \\"I won't bow down to you due to your good breeding, nor give in to your petty demands.\\"  Tisk tisk.  Not something someone should be saying to a member of the gentry.", "Aeryn is someone who is sensitive to decorum and privacy.  Why I hear tell that she led a group of people away from another group of people, so they could speak privately on a sensitive issue.  How polite and helpful.", "That Meepers!  Another helpful seamstress of the city!  Giving free garments to those who are in need.  Her heart overflows with kindness!", "Sergeant Danae is a longstanding member of the Constabulary.  But y'know... there's something about a constable who has been charged for assault that makes me think she might not be the right person for the job.  But you didn't hear that from me, I don't want her knocking down my door and beating me too.", "That Rhea.  She's a hotheaded woman.  Apparently she doesn't care what she says to who, insulting higher ranking people than herself right to their faces!  Oh the shame of it all.", "Apparently Noire's a stand up kind of girl.  Defending Cerridwyn when she was in need.  Don't ask me how or why, I just repeat what I'm told.  Maybe she'll smarten up enough to get rid of that purple fur.  Eyuck!", "I like Hush, I really do.  She gave my uncle some nasty syrup to clear up his sinuses.  But honestly.  Gossiping about nobles and Cerridwyn with the likes of Rhea?  She should really know better than that.", "That Rhea, always spouting off when she shouldn't.  I hear tell she was insulting Cerridwyn in the commons, making fun of her by saying she's a \\"lord of a bunch of commoners\\" and generally taunting her in a nasty tone, all because the gentry might have suggested that maybe her clothes weren't exactly proper.", "What is there to say about Cullan?  Well he's a high-ranking commoner with the Bisclavret.  But that won't stop him from ignoring all propriety and leaping to the defense of a vulgar fox like Rhea!  And not only that, but he didn't try to quell her tongue, he egged her on!  Encouraging her to harass a member of the gentry even more!  Not what one would expect from a squire.  Not at all.", "All I see Jahren do is run off to private rooms with women. Specifically, Vajhira, and as far as I know she's courting another man. He seems to be doing that a lot lately, and I think it's a little soon after getting out of a relationship, not to mention his antics at the social.", "I heard that Tomoe was going to join the church when she came to Triskellian.  Instead she laid with a random man not seven days after she'd arrived.  Maybe it's better that she isn't tending to S'allumer's flock.", "Danae.  What is there to say?  I should hope that not all constables has such thin skin that they would fly into a rage and bea- their friends over a simple misunderstanding and hurt feelings. The mere idea that an individual like that would be allowed within the Constabulary is absolutely disgusting and.", "Apparently Cullan likes to suggest to women that she aught chase off the other 'horses'.  Which strikes me as odd and silly.  You'd think that an established commoner and a squire wouldn't make that kind of suggestion.  Or something.  For shame!", "That slave Ryan.  I know a lot of people don't have anything good to say about him, but I hear that he risked his life and nearly died to defend his owner, who was being attacked over an argument.  Now if that is not a good slave, I don't know what is.", "So apparently a man named Dodger actually tried to pickpocket Sir Althalus.  It was even after the knight asked him for a favor and gave him two denarii to do it!  Or so they tell me.", "A man named Chesh apparently spit in three faces that we know of, including Katrina's!  And he punched a girl in the stomach!  Oh Light!  What will we do?!", "So this gal named Fergie was seen just wandering around wearing wings!  In public!  Can you believe that?  The last person with wings was Dio, and we all know how that ended.", "Apparently Tomoe has a strong will and lots of forgiveness.  Huzzah and such.", "That Ryan!  Apparently Noe was sick with something awful and he went above and beyond while taking care of her.  That's a good slave, someone get him a treat.", "Apparently Thukal's a good guy for helping Noe while she was sick.  Yay for good guys!", "Virendra!  Will it never end?!  He was soooooo disrespectful to a ranking member of the Avoirdupois House.  Just like always!  Someone should hurt him badly to teach him a lesson.", "So apparently, if what my brother said is true, Virendra insulted Noe by implying that she was a lazy good-for-nothing with a sore arse from sitting around.  Maybe there's a little nugget of truth in there, but shock and horror that he would actually say so to her!", "I heard that Ayra walked into the lounge of the boarding house with naught a scrap of cloth covering her body.  Some people are very oblivious.", "I heard through the grapevine that Izzy is shacking up with Jahren.  And they aren't even married!  You'd think she would have learned her lesson, since last time he slept with her he left her for another woman.", "So my mate was standing in the commons the other day listening to people chattering.  He tells me that Rhea and Jarek were up to no good.  She goaded him onto stabbing a newcomer with the promise of showing Jarek her 'num-nums', whatever those are.  And he did it.  Can you believe that?", "That Jarek's turning into wild beast!  Apparently he ran right up to someone and stabbed him for no reason whatsoever!", "Apparently Rhea has taken to defending the Avoirdupois for some reason.  Defend them from what?  I don't know.  But it sure seemed important when people were gossiping around the putrid well.", "Mufasa's a dirty boy!  Apparently he was seen entering the PRIVATE quarters of a MARRIED woman wearing a scandalously skimpy loincloth.  Is there no such thing as propriety in this day and age?", "In other scandalous gossip, Lidia was seen leading a scantily-clad man into her private chambers.  To \\"fit an armband.\\"  I'm sure that's not the only thing they were fitting.", "People have been boasting about how Sir Edmond sets a fine example for all of his subordinates through his courtship mannerisms, his values, and his behavior.", "The Sheriff is such a wonderful man, and he provides a great service to this city - namely protection. Rumor has it he has tightened his grip on his guards and is beginning to ensure they treat everyone with the respect and courtesy they deserve.", "I hear Sattar isn't shy about sharing the details of mating with his wife, as well as claiming publicly that he lays with two women at a time.", "Did you hear that Sir Althalus is incapable of following dueling protocol? He has the audacity to speak to those he challenges before the situation is appropriately handled, even mocking them where witnesses are available.", "You hear Sattar got arrested?  Yeah, and get this, he said to the arresting constable, \\"Tell me what the most expedient option is so that I might return to making love to my wife.\\"  How uncouth for a gentleman.", "Deputy Loki displayed some kindness and took care of the slave Ryan while Gentleman Brooks was out of town. Ain't that a sweet way to try and make ammends with someone?", "Apparently, depending on who you ask, Hush is a great aid to the Doloreaux.  Don't ask me what that means.", "Big surprise .. word on the street is that Brenner doesn't trust his own housemates, or his betters.", "Apparently Joshua's in the habit of insulting the companions of criminals.  Who'd have thunk it?", "That Brenner! Hes been going around insulting Squires again. Oh, the shame!", "Unsurprisingly, Gentleman Brooks is being a gentleman, and escorting his peers and those of a genteel nature out of less than savory situations. Hooray for decency!", "Sattar being rude.  Who would've guessed?  Apparently Joshua politely remind him to submit his testimony to the magistrate and he was rude.  And his companions growled at Joshua!  And he didn't correct them!  And he didn't bow when he left!  Will those durn foreigners ever learn?", "The absolute outrage! Former Capitaine Brenner is reported to have asked a Knight for a public apology after being called a coward.", "If you need to spill the beans to someone who's tight-lipped, Chesh is your man!", "If you wanna get paid well, go talk to that Leplow fellow. Oh, and while you're at it, ask him for some tips on wooing the ladies -- it's his specialty!", "Slam! That's the noise you'll hear if you try to follow Rhea up to he room when she's busy with another man. Then you're picking up your bruised ego and prying splinters from your face just for trying to be helpful.", "Some men just can't control their women - case in point, Jarek. He even allowed Rhea to slam the door in the face of a ranked Avoirdupois member.", "It seems Brenner takes offense at everything his now ex-love, Noe, has to say. Breaking up is so very hard to do.", "I'll tell you who's said to be a fine gentleman - Captain Carlon. He doesn't have any problem telling people to shut their inappropriate traps in front of women, and he's stoic to boot!", "In need of licks and tuggings? Find Mistress Meepers in any public location and collect your share today! For being an armigerous gentry, she sure is awful friendly. It must be that whole cat thing.", "You know what Rosabelle said about you?  You're stupid.  Keep that in mind, stupid.", "Newcomers are boasting about Noe's generosity! Need some free garments? You know who to ask now!", "I heard that after a moment of impulse where Aeryn spoke candidly in argument against Theressa, she realized her wrong and apologized earnestly and heartfeltly for the transgression.", "I hear Chesh wants to be a murderer! He cursed at and threatened to kill people in a public area. Well, if you want to be a killer, the first thing you should do is not advertise it. Now everyone is watching him.", "I hear tell that Theressa doesn't control her slave, regardless of whose company he's in or how rude he's being.  For shame.  You'd think a noble would want a slave that behaves well.", "Marcel's a baaad slave.  He likes to fiddle with scissors and do his hair in a food place (very unsanitary), in front of nobles.  And then he snaps at any other slave who tries to correct his behavior!  And -then- his mistress blames the other slave!  Say what?", "Marcel's a super baaad slave.  He likes to fiddle with scissors and do his hair in a food place (very unsanitary), in front of nobles.  Who does that when nobles are eating?  Honestly!", "Someone had a busy few hours! Want to see what a Chesh schedule looks like? O dark hundred: verbally abuse a woman. O dark fifteen: Flare the anger and cause a public scene which turns chaotic and invites a whipping and sword injuries to oneself. O dark thirty: Spit on a ranked woman. O dark fourty five: Hit a woman new to town, just to get the point across! And O Light Nine Hundred and Eleven: Disrespect a Knight, to end the day on a high note!", "Sattar's a man who sports a title and he can't be bothered to bow to a lord.  Unbelievable!", "Rhea gives free booty to any man who's willing to fight for her. Spread the word! .. Or don't.", "Doctor Hush may be strict when it comes to stealing, but she has no problem giving out her services and goods for free to anyone who looks poor.", "Not only was Sattar disrespectful enough to not bow to Lord Edmond, he made a verbal threat that Edmond would regret taking any legal action against him.", "It seems Squire Cerridwyn needs to pay attention to conversations around her, and properly acknowledge people with their titles if she wants to flaunt her Sun Duke courtesy.", "I hear tell that Sattar never bows to Avoirdupois nobility.  Because his mother died.  That's a good reason.", "Oh, the scandal! The Avo Handmaid Nan was banging chimney brushes with the chimney sweep Eddy in the commons. I heard they even wielded shoes! Who uses shoes, honestly?", "Unbelievable! A chimney sweep reducing a Handmaid to banging chimney brushes with him in the commons. Where has all the good influence in the world gone?", "People think Eddy is annoying, and he doesn't know who they are. Neener neener.", "So I hear that Sattar was being disrespectful to Lord Edmond and even while they were discussing how rude he was last time.  And lo, Shaharazad, Sattar's wife, stepped closer to him, clearly backing him up and not even trying to remind him to be polite.  Some women, huh?  Can't live with them, can't trample them with a destrier.", "They say that Sattar has long had problems with the Avoirdupois, go so far as to threaten Aeryn's fiance, Mathias, when he first arrived.", "It seems that Sir Bayard didn't learn how to be inclusive in Knight School. He recently sent away a slave from a house meeting when the slave was there on behalf of a ranked house member. These sort of reasonless dismissals merely show he is capable of nothing more than repetitious solecisms.", "Who likse to spit?! Chesh does, Chesh does! The Doloreaux don't find it nearly as exciting though, especially not their gentry.", "Some people, and by that I mean Cersei, like to imagine Bayard humping balconies. I, for one, am not appreciative of the visual.", "Nobody likes an intoxicated horse! Captain Brenner recently became privvy to this knowledge, and hopefully will be thinking twice about lushing in public and in Noble presences again.", "Doesn't Sattar show common courtesy to anyone?!  His waist doesn't appear to work!", "What can this poor horse do right? I'm exhausted just reciting his list of transgressions! To summarize, people are spreading the word that Brenner is generally disobedient, an on-the-job alcoholic, and a bad representation of equines everywhere. I'd be a lush too if people talked about me like that.", "Not only doesn't Sattar bow to nobles, he can't be bothered to use the correct form of address.  Just ask Edmond and the other Avoirdupois!", "Need math lessons? Find Nan! Need good clothes at a price that doesnt make the seamstress any money? Find Nan! No .. seriously, she's gaining a reputation of being a businesswoman.", "If you ask around, you'll hear that Ayra is patient with absent-mindedness.  Pretty great, huh?  Yeah, I thought so too.", "Apparently Sir Bayard doesn't trust his own house's gentry members, tossing out Esquire Brooks' slave from a meeting for having a supposed 'loose' tongue. It's absolutely outrageous that the Knight be so excluding and so incapable of comprehending a servant attend in the stead of a master when it is necessary. Really! The nerve of some of these Nobles!", "He hasn't been back in Triskellian long and Sattar is already -demanding- that he get paid by the Bisclavret.  And what's worse, he couldn't even bother to properly address his scroll to Viscountess Aedina and kindly request it.  No, all he has are demands.  Perhaps he should return to Peres.  Perhaps then all his demands will be met.  Or perhaps he should demand his way to the bottom of Auvrich Bay.", "Need some lessons in courtly love? Esquire Cerridwyn is your girl! She can teach you everything you need to know about wooing the perfect woman. Satisfaction guaranteed.", "A true gentleman never leaves a woman in an unsavory situation. Esquire Brooks is such a gentleman.", "Mari, Mari, havent you heard? Fooker is a naughty word!", "We've got a groper on .. in .. around our hands! That's right! I heard mister Styre insists on taking whatever liberties he likes with miss Elizabeth, and he don't give a hoot or patoot who it's in front of either. A gentleman was talking to him just the other day about this very thig, but he was occupied, he didn't even notice. Too bad everyone else noticed. Maybe they're just jealous .. or maybe it's not too late to learn the lesson of keeping your hands to yourself. Wait! Don't misconstrue those words.", "Word on the street is Elizabeth isn't married. If she isn't married, she shouldn't be letting men grope her in the commons. If she wasn't letting men grope her in the commons, I wouldn't be gossiping to you right now. Naughty girl!", "Sattar's got a history of being not-so-nice if you ask the Bisclavret.  Disrespecting and threatening a ranking member of the Avoirdupois is recent, but he has always disrespected his own House with his revolting actions.  For supposed gentry, he is completely lacking in the department of manners, discipline and proper education.  But you didn't hear that from me.  Seriously.  I don't need him coming after me next.", "I hear Handmaiden Aysun presented herself most capably at the recent Noble meeting. Yay for blending in with snoots and suits!", "How could someone as thoughtful as Sir Brumble forget to mention the Light, or anything religious whatsoever, in his toast to the city? They say it made him come across as a self-serving Noble, only interested in trade and wealth, not of spiritual purity and holiness. Let us bow our heads and say a few words for him, that he might remember who and what blessed him with his station to begin with.", "They say Lady Grazia is just brimming with faith, and that she warmly shares that faith with any who are in need. Ain't that just sweet?", "Sir Althalus was being praised in the streets for his recent meeting of Nobles to discuss the comet threat. Ain't it great to be a go-getter?", "Apparently Esquire Brooks is more interested in running away from celestial threats than staying to fight them. Can't say I blame him, really. What are you gonna do if a comet comes crashing down on you?", "Praise those who are strong in faith; Esquire Cerridwyn be one of them!", "Apparently it's bad to be afraid in Church anymore. If a comet is coming, don't go to the church and share your fear there, do it on the streets instead. Oh, and definitely don't share your fears with women. They always overdramatize situations.", "It is truly unfortunate when a gentrywoman like Mistress Meepers cannot recall the order of rank in a ceremony. She helped herself to trailing Lady Grazia during a church meeting, ousting Dame Valara from her rightful place in line. When informed of her error, she simply continued on, ignoring the impropriety in entirety.", "As a member of the religious community, Presbyter Ximen renewed the community's faith in himself by offering support to the city during the meteor shower. It's so nice to have someone to learn on in hard times.", "How wonderful it is to have a Bishop like Basanti around in troubling times to open the doors of the church and provide sermons and support for the community.", "Sir Althalus is a sharp one! He has no problem recognizing opportunities for his house to increse their power, and doesn't think twice about informing anyone on how to take the appropriate steps. Now that's a Noble!", "That Esquire Cerridwyn sure can be mean! I heard she went into the commons and just began insulting random people without having any knowledge about their ranks or positions! What's worse, she continued after being told not everyone in the room was a commoner. It just goes to show you that even ranked people can be daft at times.", "No big surprise here. Word is spreading that Chinco likes to mock the houses, and believes them all to be useless. If you didn't already know that about him, then you really need to get out more.", "I heard that Hush and Marcel had a run in at some point.  Even with Theressa, Marcel's owner, standing right there.  The slave was rude to say the least, but Hush, she kept her cool, despite the fact that the noblewoman accepted her slave's behavior.", "Tomoe doesn't seem to know the difference between a gentleman, a slave, and a commoner. Even when it was explained to her, she decided to use the term gentleman freely, calling everyone by that title whether they were worthy or not. Giving slaves such esteem is not in the least bit appropriate, and demeaning the title for those who are true gentleman is even worse.", "Marcel's not a good slave.  That's nothing new.  But that doesn't mean that he had to glare at Hush when she was speaking politely to him.  Doesn't anybody know how to whip a slave anymore?  I'd do it for free if anybody asked me to.", "I hear Alexander prefers to prance about in near nakedness. Loincloths might be fashionable in other parts of the world, but in Triskellian clothes are appreciated, if not necessary. Hang up that rag and get yourself some britches, boy!", "Brie's just so engergetic and helpful to everyone!  And she's never afraid to lick things.  Just ask her to, she'll do it!  Honest!", "Chesh nods so much his head is bound to fall off in the near future. Mix it up, will you? Especially when different ranking people walk through the room. Nodding is just so primitive and rude.", "My ears are buzzing lately with talk of this Chesh fellow. Not only is he rude in general, but when given a chance to remedy his mistakes he responds with remarks like 'Whatever', and then simply exits the area. Here's a hint: If someone gives you the opportunity to apologize, take it.", "Brenner likes to drink on the job nowadays and then he has the gall to insult everyone around him to make himself look bad.  Maybe that flogging is overdue.  Or maybe the bartender needs to know when to stop sliding the ale over the counter.", "The small things apparently don't go unnoticed these days. Noe carries around a handy dandy umbrella, did you know? Well, now you do! Next time a comet comes plummeting toward the earth, she might share it with you also. She's generous like that.", "Depend on who you ask, Cullan's handsome and considerate.  Oh, and he deserves to marry more than just a carpenter for a wife.  I wonder which Cullan they're talking about.  Not the one I know, that's for sure.  Ask him about his sword collection.", "Oh dear, I heard some people weren't appreciative of Nan's verbal rodent abilities and her public display of them. Try to keep them more private, huh? We don't want crotchety people getting the wrong idea.", "Did you know Nan's a handmaiden?  Did you know that she helped Grazia as if she were a handmaiden?  Well now you do.  Come back again and I'll spout more useless information.", "Shame on mister Zeiss, back to his old habits. I hear this time he was trying to kiss on a bunny in the commons, and when she called him a dirty old man, he retorted that she said something altogether different the night before. That kind of talk is just far too nauseating for the general public. I know, because I have to hear about it, and hearing it second-hand isn't any better.", "Polgara's a quick learner.  And a good apprentice.  Listen to the words that are coming out of my mouth.", "I hear Izzy slapped Zeiss a good one across the face for being rude, but then started blathering about who she was sleeping with right in the commons like nobody else was listening. Really, there's a time and a place for that, even in Docktown.", "So rich, so pretty, best set of hooves in the whole darn city.  That's not the best set of things she's got, either.", "Flynn's going around saying Noe of the Avoirdupois is plagued with disease. I heard he was especially cruel to her in the commons. Give the lasses a break, Admiral! They can't all be sailors.", "You know that Khagra fellow? He's with Polgara, aye? Well, I heard he's cooking up a scheme with another lass to cheat on Polgara, impregnate the new girl and get her lactacting so she can feed his adopted son. If that's not someone with big issues, I don't know what is.", "Lots of people like Nan, but lots of people don't like that she leaves important conversations without permission from the Nobles in attendance. She needs to remember to do that.", "Apparently Cullan needs his eyes checked.  Or all bats look alike.  Either way, he mistook some bat for another bat and wouldn't apologize or something.  Then he spoke rudely and stormed off.  Adult-like behavior to be sure.", "Nan wasn't very nice, and I hear she talked really poorly about someone with a drinking problem, shaming him to the point of embarrassment. Remember that compassion and understanding are part of the Great Light's teachings. Kumbaya and stuff.", "That Squire Cullan sure has some brass balls. I hear he slandered the Marquise Alessandro -and- the Don himself about their handling of Constabulary issues. Can you imagine belonging to another house in a Rinaldi city and talking down about their royalty? Witnesses say he was eager for the parties to hear of his displeasure, and so the word is spreading. I'd be peeing my pants right now if I was him.", "Cullan's prone to arguing.  He's also prone to be wrong.  A lot.  But that won't stop him from rolling his eyes and offering a false apology.  I guess if you're wrong enough, you get used to it.", "I heard Dazrene allowed a slave to kiss her hand, even though he did it without asking her first. She's married, and she didn't even make a fuss. I wonder where slave lips have been..", "The smith Tark was seen entering the bedroom of miss Star, and without a chaperone. They aren't even married!", "I heard miss Star let mister Tark into her bedroom with no chaperone, and they aren't even married!", "Rhea was going on and on about how Madalina's pregnant and she's going to go crazy.  She says Virendra should run far away from her and leave her in the care of the church.  That fox might not be wrong.  Once my wife became the size of a dray, I prayed for lightning to strike me down daily.", "The slave Ryan went to offer chaperone to miss Star, who had mister Tark in her bedroom, and she turned him away saying she wanted sex with the smith, and didn't care about her virtue. It's a good thing she doesn't care, because now everybody knows!", "They say Althalus can fight, by the Light!  But can he dance?  Can he stand on one foot?  Can he rub his stomach and pat his head at the same time?  Can he touch his nose with his tongue?  Can he lick his elbow?  These are the important questions.", "Nan is cheer and chipper!  And more importantly, she's giving away free stuff!  Quick!  Quick!  Get it while you can!", "I hear the slave Ryan went and knocked on miss Star's bedroom door, where mister Tark was, and offered to chaperone, trying to explain the implications of two single people of the opposite sex being in a room together, and the smith actually threatened the slave and tried to shoo him off in an effort to deflower the girl before she understood what she was doing. Alas, we can be pretty sure those petals have been plucked.", "Sang's a helpful sort.  Advising newcomers on what would best help further their careers and passions... now if only he'd do something about the tongue.", "They say Cullan likes to get chatty and intrusive when you try to work with hot metal on a man's arm. If you're a master jeweler, I'd stay clear of that one.", "Sattar better start learning to bow to his bettes rather than nodding, or they're going to start plotting about that pretty little neck of his hanging on their walls.", "Wynter's a good, charitable sort.  She does hair for free.  Very generous.  Pass it on.", "Everyone likes a paying customer! If you want to make things for people who actually have money, go look for Doctor Hush. She has good taste and knows how to handle her bills in a timely fashion.", "Mari's the best miner in Triskellian.  Nobody better.  Nevermind that she's not allowed to carry weapons, wear armor, or learn from her guild's instructors.  Yep.  Upstanding, best miner.", "Dazrene needs to be careful who she slights.  Like that has ever stopped her before.", "Some people are just plain old crazy. Virendra was reported to have rubbed grease all over his body before sliding across the cafe and into the wall where he proceeded to write something akin to 'Virendra was here and did dirty naughty things in this cafe'. Isn't it just a teensy bit frightening that this is a guild council member?", "Clover's a generous businessman.  He takes good care of those really loyal to him.  Don't ask about the disloyal ones.  I SAID DON'T ASK!", "Izzy, darling, sugar, pudding pie! Don't be such a hussy in public with the men who have your attention! It's unbecoming, lady or not.", "Jahren, doctor, bunny, fluffnuts! Don't be so detailed in public conversation with the women who have your attention, especially if you aren't married! It's unbecoming of a supposed professional.", "They say that Eldro is the perfect slave if you're into manners, politeness, and obedience. Are you in the market for a slave? He might be the one for you!", "As a medical professional, you'd think Doctor Jahren would check in on the people he promises to look after. He didn't do that with some of them. It's a wonder they got better on their own at all!", "I hear Lidia sometimes gives out free clothes to new people. Swarm!", "I heard Zev likes to bounce around with only his loins covered. That might work in Phelan territories, but here in Triskellian people prefer fashion and bulk. No, not that kind of bulk.", "Althalus is into romantic ideals.  He said if he wore his iron plate to a combat, he'd win a boon from a Rinaldi lady.  Swoon much.", "Virendra sure is getting a reputation for being mean! They say just reently he started an argument with a newcomer and potential customer for no good reason. I guess the Sailor's Guild isn't having such smooth sailing anymore.", "Grazia was going to marry Matteo for the good of her House.  That's gotta take some guts.  It could've been worse, I guess.  She could've been stuck with Eberhard.", "While Marcel is said to have been bred as a slave, he sure didnt have the arrogance or callousness bred out of him. Most everyone agrees that he is just about the most unhelpful, snooty, and self-serving servant ever to scrub the Triskellian trash cans.", "Sang's a good fellow, usually.  But a Doloreaux knight asked him to do something and he got caught up in his own self-center wishes.  Didn't do what was requested.  Typical artsy type.", "Brenner needs to really take a look at his interactions with women. You don't yell at them, man! They always get revenge, and it's always worse than you can possibly expect.", "Sang's not prone to paying attention to people who offer him help.  Apparently.  Slap him for me next time you see him.", "Sang swears in public sometimes.  And in front of faithful Penitents of S'allumer.  Tisk tisk, Sang.  You should know better than that.", "Sattar may carry the title gentleman, but a true gentleman would never threaten a Noble. With all the trash talk I hear about him, I wonder how he hasn't yet fallen prey to the dagger of an assassin, or the bullet of a sniper. One thing's for sure, he needs to start treading more carefully.", "Apparently Sir Edmond is anal-retentive about proper acknowledgement. How dare a Knight expect people to bow to him! Such incredulousness!", "Some people are just too sensitive.  Rosabelle is one of those people.  Bugger is not a four letter word.", "Shouting and scream in the commons like a child is pretty common fare.  Especially for Mari.  But telling people to leave her alone and stop making fun of her because they were trying to help understand what she was saying?  Maybe if you took the mush out of your mouth, Mari, you wouldn't have these problems.", "Regrettably, I heard tale that Brenner preyed upon one of his former female guards, treating her as an insubordinate when he had already been relieved of his Captaincy. Despite having plenty of opportunity to inform her that he no longer retained his position, he continued with the farce until the rest of the house confronted him about it. How shameful and depressing that a once great soldier of the Avoirdupois would stoop to such things.", "Oh no!  Basanti isn't in the habit of answering important scrolls in a timely manner!  And she's one of the higher ranking members of the Church!  We're doomed I tell you!  The end times are upon us!  REPENT SINNERS!  REPENT!", "Once again, Gentleman Sattar proves to be incapable of bowing to his betters, and furthermore he verbally invites fire upon another house when he was cordially wished that the light bless him. Is there no end to his disrespect?", "Sir Althalus certainly is taking initiative lately! I heard he has a plot in the works to hold a tournament for the guards of every embassy. Maybe even the commoners will get to compete, wouldn't that be exciting? Woo!", "Sir Althalus will be holding a tournament, but it hasnt happened yet.", "Some people find Sir Edmond irritating. Others do not. Do you like green eggs and ham?", "Sir Edmond has flexed his political muscles and made an agreement with Viscountess Aedina regarding promotions. Did you know that he's fabulous at sucking up as well? Yep. Not all Nobles were promoted for their skill with a sword.", "Sattar's supposed to be a gentleman and Bisclavret gentry, right?  Then how come he spends all of his time in the commons being rude and slandering people?  In fact, just the other day, I overheard him using coarse language in front of a group of ladies.  Words like, \\"patootie\\" and \\"rubbish\\" and \\"balderdash\\".", "So you know Bayard, right?  Do I need to say much more about him?  Apparently I do.  My brother-in-law's foot fungal expert told me he likes to dress up in masks, pretend to be a commoner again, and doesn't properly bow to nobles.  Even peers.  What's with that?", "Virendra should really be more careful about how he does his politicking and conspiring.  Apparently he'll talk to anonymous people just about anywhere.  And when some poor, unfortunate soul comes along, he'll tell them to go forth and multiply.  Tisk tisk.", "Sang's got this annoying way of slurring his speech.  You've heard it I'm sure.  Sounds like he's drunk or addled in the head.  But that doesn't stop him from blathering on and on and on about nonsense that doesn't need to be said.  Plus he's cocky.  I wonder if all artsy types are like that.", "That Anabella is pretty disagreeable slave.  But apparently she has a soft spot for cubs.  Maybe she shouldn't be strung up by her neck.", "That Sattar.  He's been gone a while and probably forgot how Triskellian works.  Now he's back and insulting nobility at his leisure.  And he was arrested for it.  Who made him what he is, I wonder?", "It's not news, but Chesh is in the habit of drinking, cursing, and spitting.  Not necessarily in that order.  Commoners are bad, mmmkay?", "That Marcel.  And his owner, Theressa.  He has a mouth on him and she doesn't care.  You'd think a noble of any sort would want a slave that's better behaved.  Or at least attempt to correct his behavior.", "You want irony?  I got irony.  Chinco went ahead and threatened people to attend lectures on courtesy.  Some mook didn't go.  So Chinco was courteous enough to punch him in the face.  Yeah, I thought the irony was delicious too.", "News!  News!  I've got new!  Commoners go around insulting each other pointlessly!  Like Naomi!  I bet you're surprised.", "Thieves aren't all that uncommon in Docktown.  Depending on who you ask.  But that Dodger, he, she, it, is the worst.  Incredibly rude, even in apologies.  One of these days, a rough and tumble guard is going to teach them a lesson.", "Hush, Hush, Hush!  No don't be quiet, silly, Hush!  The doctor!  She's a person you want on your team and isn't afraid to use her University's resources to help!", "If you're giving out advice, Hush wants to hear it.  She might not apply it, but she'll be polite and gracious in the process.  Now if only my sister was the same way when I talk about her husband being a lazy good for nothing.", "Minerva makes good impressions, even when dealing with someone who gives me the willies.  Responding reasonably, she doesn't simper or become aggressive.  Balance in all things.  One body.  One mind.  Harmony within.  Harmony without.  Sunshine and rainbows and flowers.", "Not only is she a doctor, Hush is a great teacher!  Just go ask her for a lesson!  The best cure for anything is a grasshopper leg and eye of newt.", "Flynn's an admiral I hear.  But he's not above serving drinks when the slavers gather.  Kind of makes you wonder if they're emperors and queens.", "If you're a doctor and you need to bandage Sunta, don't worry!  She has all the bandages you need!", "Generous doctor!  She provides her services free of charge!  How wonderful is that?!  Charity is too uncommon for those who truly need it.... like guards of the Great Houses.  They need all the charity they can get.  Seriously.", "They say that Cerridwyn has a great many suitors since she has come to Triskellian.  And she's doing the right and proper thing by considering each and every one of them.  Not rushing in like any commoner would.  Adhering to her father's wishes and propriety.  That's good stuff.", "Chinco's got a habit of offering to break peoples' necks for them.  Even when there are other options.  He's kind of a one-trick jenner, huh?", "Not only does he offer to break peoples' necks, Chinco encourages slaves to break slavers' necks.  Just because the slaver treated a slave like a slave.  Power to the people?", "Hush is in the habit of bringing people gifts.  Especially valueless ones.  Like carrots.  How nice of her!  It's the thought that counts, really.", "Anabella's a pretty lousy slave most times.  But she's not afraid to tell people to shut their mouths when they start encouraging a slave revolt.", "Slaves are generally bad in Triskellian.  But Anabella's turning into a good slave now that she's owned by Swan!  Helpful, respectful, and uncaring for her own safety sometimes!  Yay for slaves.", "If you need a slave trained, go find Swan.  He's got a steady hand and can turn a malicious, disrespectful piece of property into a model slave.", "Brenner's in the habit of giving stuff to people he doesn't like.  Maybe a whipping is just what he needed.", "Slaves shouldn't swear at commoners.  Seriously.", "No really, slaves shouldn't swear at commoners.  Especially when being asked to do a favor.", "Brenner's in the habit of looking after his House's interests.  This includes disciplining unruly slaves so that the slave's owner and the House as a whole saves face.", "Brenner's starting to practice his drawing.  Not only that, he's drawing religious imagery.  That's a good horsey.", "Brenner's trying to mend his ways after getting smacked around by his superiors in the Avoirdupois.  He's polite and proper to just about everyone.", "Marcus has always been a good guy.  Like a hero out of legend, he comes into town, fixes everything and then rides off into the sunset.", "He's an attentive slave, let me tell you.  Always making a point of sending tea to people who like tea.  I like tea.  He gave me some.  See?  Proof.", "That Grazia isn't your regular woman.  She takes an interest in politics as well as dresses, tea, and dancing.", "Lianaar's a sharp cookie!  So used to dealing with nobles and higher ups!  Introductions between strangers is important for these people.", "Leading by example and trying to educate the unwashed masses, Katrina is deserving of respect and all that garbage.", "Phineas is charitable, giving clothes to people new to town!  Kind of live every other seamstress or tailor... hmmm.  Do we see a trend?", "Sattar has a history of terrible behavior, having threatened and punched a member of the gentry!  He dishonors all gentry everywhere with his behavior.", "Althalus is a most honorable knight, coming to the defense of fair ladies at all times!  He's credible and so forth!  Wee!", "Instead of automatically hiring a man who has a reputation for being unreliable, Marcus checks around with previous employers to make sure he isn't blacklisted before taking him on.  That's good thinking.", "Leave it to Chinco to go around grabbing on women in public.  And not in a good way, I'm told.", "Cullan has a way of speaking up when it's not welcome.  Like when a flogging is almost over.  But his two bits need to be added about how the thing is being conducted.", "Sattar can't seem to be polite to anyone.  Even people he's requesting things from.  They're just demands.  And woe to a craftsman who doesn't know how to make something!  It gets worse!", "Cullan knows how to bow to nobility.  Good boy.", "Hush stands up boldly for people!  The Doloreaux in particular.  Don't ask me why or how, I'm just repeating what I hear.", "Chinco's bad.  Even to pretty ladies.  Is that so surprising?  I didn't think so either.", "Sattar can't be bothered to bow to anyone!  Anyone I tell you!  Makes you wonder why he bothers to leave his room.", "Sattar happens to enjoy acting lewdly with his wife in front of people.  That's what women are for, I guess.  Though he could keep it behind closed doors.", "Francis is a silly commoner.  He'll go running up to any noble all willy nilly if given the opportunity.  That's just impolite.", "Ryan's a good healer.  Always willing to help.  He even helped Brenner after the horse was flogged.  Go Ryan!", "Marcel has better things to do with his time.  Better things than what?  I don't know.  I guess he needed to go be rude to someone.", "Commoners that don't offer proper deference to their betters?  Perish the thought!", "Rankin's a smelly old sea rat.  Doesn't mean he shouldn't be respectful to cultured ladies.", "Apparently Chinco's a coward these days.  He won't do much to anyone who can't defend themselves.  But he'll encourage others to shoot people.  What's that all about Chinco?", "Leif's a mushy guy at heart.  He'll show compassion to just about anyone.  Go cry on his shoulder, I encourage it.", "That Katrina is productive and willing to spread knowledge with zest!  Knowledge of what?  I'm not sure.  Maybe she could show me a few things in her private library, if you know what I mean.", "Katrina's very proactive for her House.  Yay Katrina, she does lots.", "Katrina is determined to make Triskellian a better place!  If only more people were like her.  This is a skink's den that needs fixing.  But don't tell the Don I said that.", "In case you haven't heard, Brie hands out free clothes to people who have just arrived in Triskellian.  Just in case you didn't know.  Need me to repeat it?", "You hear?  Sattar isn't above yelling at jewelers or badmouthing lePlow.  I wonder if anyone has a problem with that...", "Asima's one of Sattar's girls, I hear.  Don't ask what they do for him.  But I hear tell she ordered some kind of slinky, black leather number if that's any indication.", "Marcel's a lazy good for nothing slave.  All he does is yell at the other slaves like he's better than them and he can't be bothered to clean the trash.", "Seriously, Marcel won't clean the trash.  How many times do I have to tell people that?", "Free pie!  Need I clarify?", "Ryan's self-righteous and high-and-mighty.  Yeah, I giggled too.", "You know Cullan?  I thought you might.  Yeah, he was giving orders to people above him on the food chain.  Not smart, if you know what I mean.", "Did you know that lighting slaves on fire is a popular past time in Sattar's homeland?", "Zaria's a mighty brave gal!  When a knight needed help in combat, she risked her life to aid him!  Insert witty statement here.", "Zaria's got a mouth on her!  Talking about fornication, ew, and pregnancy, yuck, in mixed company with gentry nearby!  Light help me!", "They say Noe broke Brenner's heart.  At least she's political enough to know when it's time to cut dead weight loose.", "Rhea's a good, professional flogger.  She'll do her job regardless of how many people frown up on it.", "When it comes to politics, Aedina's a sharp cookie.  She went around and lobbied other nobles for their opinions on how to punish a misbehaving House member.  That's good in my book.", "Guy's supportive toward Aine.  He understands her goals to better herself.  She might even learn something new!  How's that for snazzy?", "Did you hear that Sir Bayard dressed down to try and blend in as a commoner? That's not so bad, but using a disguise to be rude to fellow Nobles while in Newtown? Unsurprisingly unappreciated. It's a shame that those who are blessed with titles aren't more grateful, and don't set a better example.", "Hooray for a Noble who makes it a personal crusade to promote respect for Nobility. I hear many are unappreciative, but there are those who secretly applaud his endeavors.", "I hear Esquire Brooks does just what a Squire should do - support his Noble. Finally, someone gets the idea.", "Apparently someone's mother didn't teach them about carrying sharp items around young'ns. Polgara was out and about toting her babe through layers of ash while dual wielding a carving knife. It's nice to see that children are still given only to responsible individuals.", "Apparently mister Khagra supports knife-wielding mothers who tow their children through thick ash without a care in the world. For shame!", "Baron Edmond might be strict with punishment, but he sure doesn't seem to care much about the sort of healing those punished received. A severely lashed squire and no doctor in sight? Say it isn't so!", "More and more people speak of Sir Bayard's attempted disguise and his absolute disrespect for a Viscountess and Baron. If he wants to be a commoner again, these sort of acts are the way to ensure it happens! Lets just hope he learns from the whole ordeal.", "Rhea seems to have had some problems handling pirate negotiations when Lady Theressa was kidnapped. They say she didn't assert herself at all, and let the criminals walk all over everyone. Regardless of the fact the Lady is alive, she still got hurt, and fingers are pointing in one direction to place the blame.", "Talk about a bad listener! When warned about Gentleman Sattar, Star still wanted to work for him. She seems absolutely certain there are no underlying intentions behind her employment, but everyone knows the truth. When someone tried to be nice and point out she could be making a mistake, she attacked them! Perhaps being unfriendly is a better way to gain her favor ..", "They say Star likes to hit slaves who try to give her advice. Amazing that a freeman would lower themselves to public assault over simple words, yah? To top it all off she's associating with that Sattar fellow, and she already has a reputation of being a tart. Some people just never learn..", "Pru is so nice! She sends some of her best items to people just to make sure they're used and not lying about.", "Everyone loves fruit, and Shaharazad is happy to give it as an apology. Her family customs might be different, but everyone's on the same page when it comes to food!", "What a good wife Shaharazad is, giving out free fruits to atone for her husband's nasty behavior. Maybe if Sattar would take a few hints from her he wouldn't be so annoying.", "The criminals sure do like a girl who's willing to keep them company behind bars.", "Nobody likes a Noble who plays favorites and then disrespects the rest of her peers. While she might outrank many, Viscountess Aedina still has a responsibility to properly acknowledge those she passes, especially since she is so quick to point it out when others don't do it.", "There aren't many people nowadays who keep true to their word, but Lady Valara is one of them. It's so nice to see a Noble who still has good morals and values.", "Acting a gentleman, Veritas was kind enough to gift out his coat during a rainstorm to an accompanying woman. How sweet.", "Due to some crazy weather, Marea decided to lift her shirt and flash the marketplace, without a single thought to her own reputation. They say she was doing it to save the city. What a martyr she is!", "Flashing isn't necessarily good, regardless of the reasons.", "People have the wrong idea about Shaharazad. She really is a kind, helpful, and real fine woman.", "For a married man trying to find the Light, Geradan sure does know how to take advantage of women. During a big storm recently, he told some woman to lift her shirt and flash the wind in defiance, and she actually did it! It's just low he would even suggest that kind of behavior, and disappointing.", "Meepers decided to accuse a Baronet of being daft in the way of elementals. Hah. As if she is some sort of authority on magical beings.", "A gentry woman should know the proper procedure for duels, but alas, Meepers does not. She started spouting off conditions to Baronet Althalus before he even accepted! Still, at least she has enough of an idea of honor to not stand for being called a fool.", "It isn't nice to call people idiots, especially gentryfolk. Mari apparently didn't know that.", "This lass is capable of calling people out without being direct or rude; what a gift! I hear she was very polite when she corrected gentry woman Meepers for insulting Baronet Althalus.", "Acting a gentleman, mister Cullan was kind enough to escort a gentrywoman back to her room. He's also very good support during arguments, in case you ever need someone.", "Nobles shouldn't disrespect gentryfolk, and they especially shouldn't call them stupid. Baronet Althalus supposedly has some issues with people trying to aid him with situations outside of his realm of understanding.", "What a delightful girl Katrina is, and always such a pleasure to be around!", "Public declarations of people's stupidity are not generally well-received, but Mari makes them anyway. Even if people are idiots, or worse, are ranked idiots, it isn't her place to say so, lest she look like an idiot herself.", "Sattar really needs to stop snapping at his wife when there are witnesses around, especially when she's only trying to make sure he's alright. Nobody likes it, everyone hates it, and they want him to go eat mud.", "Finally a gentlewoman who understands propriety and tradition! Rumor has it that Cerridwyn is planning on debuting herself to any eligible bachelors interested in pressing suit. Grab some new outfits men, and get in line!", "What a misunderstood soul Sattar is. It's unfortunate that people don't look deep enough to see his heart, as he really is a kind and family-oriented man.", "A pox on Meepers for having a bad past! It's no wonder commoners are so very disrespectful to those of rank, with her being the only example of gentry around for so long. Having previous occupations as a slave and a woman of the night certainly don't help her case, nor does the fact that she rummages around in trash bins for dead vermin. Where does all that money she makes from clothing go? I wonder ..", "Despite being able to have any man she might want, including a Baron, miss Brooks conceded to her father's choice for marriage and continues to honorably defend that choice. It sets such a good example, her being so obedient and loyal to her family.", "Did you hear Lord Marcus sponsored someone in the Bisclavret for promotion? He did! And all in the name of strengthening house ties. What a good Noble.", "Lord Marcus and the Rinaldi are singing Xena's praises for all the hard work shes done, despite having been in the house for only a short period of time.", "*tisk tisk* Nobles are starting to become aware that Esquire Katrina values the opinions of slaves. Why would you ever listen to the thoughts of anyone so beneath you?", "Just because Sattar is foreign, doesn't mean he has to behave so badly. He's sullying the name of gentry everywhere, and that just isn't right.", "Rude, crass, and violent, Sattar is now making claims that the sylph visitors are demons, and even had the audacity to charge at one! If they are such bad creatures, how is it that he still successfully acts worse than them, and what does that make him?", "No respect, no respect, not even for the Nobility. Word has it that guilds and houses won't even take a second glance at Chinco anymore. Who's the joke now?", "They slay Hush does a really good job of training slaves, and she keeps one who's capable of making special teas. If you're thirsty for something unique, hint around to her.", "People are starting to call Chinco 'the public mule', due to his rude and distasteful behavior.", "Shaharazad was gifted a rose from a slave, but her husband threw a tantrum, and so she tossed the precious flower right onto the ground and didn't give it another look. Even if she didn't want it she shouldn't have been so tactless, and if she did, she shouldn't have been so cowardly. With her and her husband being gentry, they should have better manners.", "When a fellow member of the gentry invited her to tea through a missive, she refused to reply at all. Apparently declining someone is acceptable, but not answering scrolls is not.", "The gentleman sure is getting violent these days! He attempted to attack the visiting Sylph Rhoswen at least once and then continued to intimidate and threaten her in a public area. I sure hope those creatures aren't judging all of us by his actions.", "The Rinaldi appreciate the efforts of Esquire Katrina, who escorted one of her house members to their sitting area to ensure he apologized for rushing past without acknowledgement.", "The Rinaldi appreciate the efforts of Sir Erwin, who insisted one of his house members apologize to the Nobility for rushing past without acknowledgement.", "It takes a man to apologize when he has erred. Though he rushed past two Rinaldi Nobles without so much as an upward glance, he did return to apologize and make amends. That's worth a lot in some people's books.", "Veritas really needs to stop questioning the natural order of things. While it's good to be inquisitive, some people are simply born to rank and honor, and they don't need to explain themselves to the rabble beneath them. Get it? Got it? Good.", "Not everyone can earn Chinco's respect personally, and people are starting to get sore that they have to prove themselves on a continuous basis to such rabble.", "The commoners sing the praises of Shaharazad for giving out free food reasonlessly.", "The populace appreciates Dame Theressa's efforts in getting her slave, Marcel, to collect and bring dew for the visiting sylphs.", "Ryan shouldn't expect to be sided with over spouses, and it's not very nice for himi to jump to conclusions about people, no matter how often they have to placate their husbands.", "Some bash him, some love his sweet heart and generous nature. Ain't it crazy how that works?", "Ryan's really good about apologizing, even if not in the most timely fashion. It's actually a smart tactic .. waiting until people have forgotten what you did wrong before saying how terrible you feel. I bet he finds a lot of forgiveness that way.", "It's so unlike a gentrywoman to throw a tantrum and storm off when she can't explain everything she wants to - unlike every gentrywoman except Katrina, that is. Watch out if you touch on one of the subjects she has 'expertise' in, or you'll get a taste of her bad temper and swift exit.", "Lance Corporal Cullan was kind enough to ask one of the visiting sylphs to heal Brenner. Who even knew the Bisclavret cared about the welfare of the Avoirdupois?", "While well versed in some things, Cullan still can't manage to properly address people. Using first names to chat with gentry isn't the most formal way to go about it, eh?", "Thank the Light there's a jeweler around willing to explain things to people, and encourage their own choices and unique tastes. I hear Lidia even knows all of the inventories of Clover's other jewelers. Want to take a peek? Go and ask!", "Even though he's a merchant and gardener by trade, Ramsford was more than willing to help out the Sheriff in organizing a promotion party. I wonder just how much party organizing experience he has .. or what sort of parties he's used to organizing. Here's looking forward to a sloshed Constabulary!", "The Doloreaux sing the praises of their skilled seamstress, Inalla, and boast about the fine quality of her parasols. If you need something to protect you from the elements, seek this one out!", "People acknowledge and respect the Esquire's attempts to curb the errant behavior of her house's gentryman, Sattar. It's such a relief to know that the Bisclavret don't stand for disgraceful behavior, even amongst their own.", "An Esquire should never have the audacity to challenge a Noble to a duel. Despite the huge rank difference, which is obvious, it's generally disrespectful. To top it off, Meepers even started citing terms and demands before the challenge was even accepted. Seriously ... what is wrong with her?", "Sometimes I just can't believe my ears! Madalina walked into a public area to announce that Chinco had bedded her. When nobody acted interested she rushed off sulking. What did she expect people to do?", "Want to hear all about Chinco's prowess with the ladies? Just ask Madalina, who is all too familiar. Apparently she's a jilted lover, seeking revenge against him for his loss of interest. To make it even more interesting, she's offered the Doloreaux a gang of thugs willing to beat him up on their behalf.", "The business types of the city are claiming to be smarter than the nobles, I hear. They are certainly better at making money, but are they better at running the city? At least they're smart enough not to say anything to the nobles faces.", "I hear that Xena, she rewards those that do good work for her. Sometimes more than was necessary. I wish the innkeeper was like that. I cleaned the entire stables, and all I got was one mug of ale. In a dirty glass.", "Shaharazad should be commended for her duty and attention to her wifely obligations, especially considering who she's married to.", "Admiral Flynn disrespected the seamstress Brie by implying that she was a useless member of society! Doesn't he know Rainbow Rags is a guild on the guild council? Guilds don't get that sort of position by being useless.", "Zeiss not only murdered Doctor Hush, but when he finally decided to compensate her, he arranged a deal which she agreed with, and then he postponed payments for months! Don't ever listen to the promises of a weasel.", "That Ryan sure does take good care of the city plant life. People haven't ever seen a slave do the kind of work he does, even though they're supposed to. Those enforcers need to get the rest of the slaves in line!", "Even though she was getting ready to leave and take care of her own stuff, Doctor Hush stopped and offered to teach a slave about healing if they wanted to learn. That someone goes out of their way to educate city slaves is a great service to the city.", "That Marea is a real find when it comes to organization and taking charge! When LePlow was out of town, she ran everything in his absence.", "Lady Grazia attended and supported Baronet Althalus while fighting the pirate lord Quentin McGabe, despite fears that she might be kidnapped and made a captive. Can't really say how smart she was for doing so, but she also gave a token to the defeated Captain when he lost. Talk about taking risks!", "Baronet Althalus not only defeated the pirate Captain, Quentin McGabe, he also won honor for his house and ended a pirate threat. Who knows what benefits the services of the captain may lead to in the future? Ah, the suspense.", "Baronet Althalus won the hand-to-hand duel between himself and pirate Captain Quentin McGabe, showing his battle prowess and dedication to freeing his lands of a pirate threat. Hooray!", "That Dahlia offered Baronet Althalus a luck charm just before his duel with pirate Captain Quentin McGabe. It takes guts for a commoner to just proffer something to a Noble like that, and it seems like the charm worked, too, as the Baronet claimed victory!", "For shame! Gentleman Sattar has proven he is incapable of paying his debts even after three months! Is there any mis-step this man hasn't made as of yet?", "I hear that Eddy's a fan of taking coin from people, especially those who say they don't have any work for him. Don't bother to tell him to ask instead of steal either, as he's prone to saying if he wanted to hear lectures he'd stay awake in church. I wonder what the clergy think about that statement?", "It's a shame what atrocious manners Ms. Donatella has. I heard she went in the commons and immediately starting barking questions out about her Lord and where he was, completely disregarding the presence of her betters in the area.", "Does anyone else realize how much time Doctor Jahren puts into his patients and bettering himself? People say he has spent most of his time and money on his guild and ensuring there's enough free training for all his employees who want to learn.", "Elizabeth pointed out to gentleman Sattar that it's improper to insult a Noble's slave to someone else. She said that instead he should just take his complaints directly to Baronet Althalus. Witnesses enjoyed her lecturing the gentleman, but there's something to be said too about the impropriety of a commoner speaking like that to a member of gentry.", "Gentleman Sattar dubbed Lia an 'absolutely insufferable creature', and right in front of her husband no less. It's one thing to ridicule a slave for their behavior, if it's pertinent, but quite another to ridicule someone's wife and disrespect the husband simultaneously. That Sattar is just lucky he isn't dealing with the old pirate Geradan, or who knows what body parts he might be missing.", "With his public apology on the forums, people are seeing Gentleman Sattar is at least beginning to repair his tarnished honor. Moreover, they're hoping that this isa new for him since it seems like he's running out of chances to fix his reputation.", "In full view of her husband, Marcel professed to Lia how much he missed her. Ordinarily not a problem, right? Well, it wouldn't be, except that Marcel has a history of trying to kiss and romance Lia when her husband isn't around. Ahhhh, the dramas of slavery.", "When asked about making a new and better statue to represent former Reeve Leah, mister Dune was exceedingly helpful in suggesting variations of stone or marble that would work best, and also offered to travel outside of town to seek something more suitable than what was in his own inventory. When compensation was offered for his time and effort, he declined, saying he was merely happy to serve the Rinaldi. His willingess to help and go above and beyond the call of duty is something to appreciate and respect.", "Doctor Hush was chatting with a woman in the commons today and questioning her about the last time she bled naturally. Good grief, talk about inappropriate, not to mention the lack of confidentiality people expect from Doctors.", "A lunatic threatened miss Elizabeth, and calm as can be she told him to apologize and leave. It's amazing how polite and proper she is, even under the worst of circumstances.", "Tibbs threatened a Noble's propety and assaulted a free woman, with her own parasol no less! Sounds like one for the Constables, eh? Hope the people involved were smart enough to take up the problem with the slavers and the law.", "Everyone loves a free spirit, but a loincloth in the middle of the commons? Talk about inappropriate.", "Mistress Meepers has a really come a long way since first arriving in Triskellian, and done a good job of applying herself to the studies of genteel society. I wish I could say the same for some of the other gentry.", "Talk about a spunky raccoon! That Lianaar built herself up to the running the Bisclavret embassy purely on her own wits, and even managed to part from the house on good terms. Then, instead of sponging off her fiance's guild, she strikes off on her own again to find her own path.", "People still talk about what the Presbyter did to Adriana. Debts might not always come due quick in Docktown, but they always come due.", "Avoirdupois chivalry at its finest! Thukal not only helped carry heavy barrels, but when offered payment, he refused and said he was just happy to help!", "Eldro's all the chatter lately, but somehow people didn't notice he's a he and not a she. People are raving about how innocuous she is, sitting in the background not bothering anyone. Scary that if you sit back far enough your gender gets swapped.", "After her last incident with Gentleman Sattar, slave Lia has learned it's best to keep a low profile and not instigate any problems with him. It's a shame so many of the other slaves are gluttons for punishment when they obviously know how he is.", "Even after Gentleman Sattar argued with Ryan about him giving his wife gifts, Ryan continued to send more gifts behind the gentryman's back, and then got angry when the gifts were returned to him! Could Ryan be suffering from a mental ailment or a medical condition?", "Sergeant Danae loitered around the jailhouse blabbing judgmentally about Gentleman Sattar while he was trying to deal with his charges. Then, she had the audacity to turn around and try to barter her OWN punishments with the Sheriff at the very same time! So very rude, and unbecoming of a Constabulary member.", "What a mongrel! I hear Asima has been sleeping around with dirty, rude men, and hiding it from her owners and employers! Even worse, she's proud of what she's doing, and that's just plain ole' trashy.", "Aww, how sweet, Gentleman Sattar is finally apologizing to his wife for his inappropriate public scenes. She educated me about how it takes a decent man to set aside his pride and admit when he's wrong. It's just strange how much she loves him.", "Squire Tonozzi was kind enough to lend Shaharazad money to help pay Gentleman Sattar's fines. How charitable and kind!", "Oh my!  Fighting within the Church's ranks!  It turns out just recently Yarwoodle accused Pastor Savryn of stealing from the Church!  From what I heard, he did not even approach Savryn or ask him about what happened before making his high accusations!  Who is Yarwoodle you ask?  He's that crazy hermit priest who can't quite get his sentences straight.", "That Esquire Aysun works tirelessly and diligently for the betterment of the Bisclavret. Every single time Gentleman Sattar is rude and impolite, she is right there to apologize for him and smooth things over, limiting any damage done to her embassy.", "Star has a genuine appreciation for music that most people lack. When Sang was playing his violin in the commons, nobody paid any attention whatsoever, and seeing that his attempt to lighten the mood had no effect, he stopped. Star encouraged him to carry on playing and listened when no others would. A crush, perhaps, or just enjoyment of fine melodies? Who knows, but her efforts to include people and support their good attempts are something to be grateful for.", "Sattar was in jail and practically begged Sheriff Joshua to talk to the magistrate on his behalf to get his punishments changed. The Sheriff agreed to do the favor for him on several conditions, one being that the Gentleman start showing respect to the Constabulary and the Sheriff himself. After the terms were agreed upon, and the Sheriff confirmed he would visit the magistrate as soon as possible, Shaharazad arrived with money to pay the gentryman's fines, at which point he automatically turned back on his deal with the Sheriff. Can you imagine striking a deal with the law and breaking it? I hope for his sake Sattar doesn't end up back in jail, or his negotiations will probably be short and not in his favor.", "Sattar made a deal with Sheriff Joshua to talk to the magistrate on his behalf so his punishments could get changed and he wouldn't have to remain imprisoned. Just after the deal was struck, Shaharazad arrived with coin to pay the fines, at which point the gentleman began prattling off about how he didn't need any favors, and then demanded the payment for the favors back! He doesn't want favors? I doubt he'll find any with the Sheriff again.", "The good Squire Cullan offered to act as a guard and escort for gentlewoman Aysun, only to stand in the background guzzling down spirits! What started out as a kindness turned into unprofessionalism very fast.", "That Luciano has a mouth on him! I heard he told mister Fyros publicly to shut his mouth, and then started accusing other people in the area of violent crimes without having any proof! Here's a hint, Lucky; if you know of a violent crime, you report it to the Constabulary.", "After a public spat between two of his 'girls', Sattar dragged them both off. Moments later they returned, one of them having a cigar burn in her ear! It looks like Sattar thinks he's above the law with his eccentric forms of 'discipline'.", "Mister Veritas is being very generous with his time and company resources in helping to get people established in the city. They all seem to be appreciative of his kindness.", "No wonder Sattar doesn't have any respect for Geradan and Lia's marriage, he doesn't have any respect for his own! He was going around hugging other women that aren't his wife, and all clingy-like too, in full public view! Someone saw him snuggling up cozy to that Shirin woman, and whispering in her ear right in the commons. For shame!", "Esquire Katrina always gives excellent political advice, and isn't afraid to do investigative work to make sure it's the best. She's always looking for opportunities to expand the Doloreaux's influence, and she maintains contact with all the embassy's allies. It's no wonder she's being made the Doloreaux's official political advisor!", "A nobleman asked mister Ambrose whether or not he was ready to swear fealty to a house, and instead of giving a straight answer, he responded with a theoretical treatise about loyalty. Perhaps some thought should be put into guilds for this one, especially if he's going to offend Nobility.", "Ammy was hugging all over her slave in the middle of the commons, and when someone mentioned it made them uncomfortable and wasn't really proper, she continued to do it saying she can do what she wants, when she wants, and she doesn't care what other people think. While hugging in and of itself isn't inappropriate, hugging a slave in public? Not the best idea in the world.", "While Ammy might be a lovely person, she shouldn't be hugging on her slave in the common area, telling people that he's 'more than a friend'.", "I hear Donatella was peeping at mister Brenner over the screen in the infirmary when he had clearly wanted privacy as Doctor Hush worked on him. How inappropriate, especially for someone honored with the title of Squire.", "Admiral Flynn attended one of Xena's courtesy classes to try to learn how to act better. He even let her make him the girl in one of her examples! What a good sport.", "That slave Lia came out of the church holding a man's hand ... and .. surprise! It wasn't her husband's! She was lifted nonchalantly by her partner-in-crime in hopes that nobody would see him gift her with a shiny new bracelet. Oooo. I think people need to be more sneaky, because somebody saw.", "Esquire Mathias was holding the slave Lia's hand coming out of the church. He lifted her from the ground and laughed at her before slipping a bracelet into her hand, telling her to be quiet. His fiance was next to him the whole time, and she didn't utter a word. Interesting how slaves and gentry interact these days, no?", "It doesn't pay to get too familiar with your slave. Doctor Hush had her arm around Ryan's shoulders as if they were lovers! How improper!", "It doesn't pay to get too familiar with your owner! Doctor Hush had her arms around Ryan's shoulders as if they were lovers! How entirely improper!", "Brenner has been making a real effort to be respectful and polite all the time. He's a good example of proper behavior, and it's so great to see that he learned from his punishment and turned over a new leaf.", "Apparently Lia doesn't see the need in bowing or acknowledging people anymore. Have you seen how she just bobs her head and then mostly does nothing? Terrible manners.", "Lia seems to think it's appropriate to act as though she's equal with members of a different house! She was whispering to Gentleman Mathias even in front of Lady Theressa, which is incredibly rude to begin with, and then later she was all over Mathias' arm, while his own fiance was on the other arm! She seriously needs to learn that her place isn't even equal to that of a freeman, let alone a gentlewoman.", "Can you believe that alley cat and his ego? The size of Calabria I tell you. If anyone in the Avoirdupois acted as he did, they would find themselves without a House. That Gentleman Sattar should certainly learn some respect for his peers and his betters after the way he jaunted through the commons, glaring at Esquire Aeryn. The gall he has after she deigned curtsy to her inferiors. No acknowledgment to those of his House or even to Gentleman Mathias.", "I hear that Lady Theressa is finally punishing her slave, Marcel, even having him whipped for having coins in his room!", "That tactless mutt, Virendra, had the nerve to stand around sharing his 'opinion' with the members of his guild about how he so strongly dislikes Gentleman Sattar, speaking at length to his employee to discern his own opinion before dragging him off to conspire further. It is shameful behavior to openly trash talk a man right in the presence of his wife! He should be ashamed of himself!", "I hear Brenner is really good about promptly paying crafters for services rendered, and what's more, he didn't take advantage of Specialist Lulu's offer for a cheaper deal in exchange for a kiss on the cheek. What a pillar of courtesy!", "Gentleman Sattar asked a jeweler for metals to use for his meteor rock, and then started being rude to her right after doing so! If you want to do business with someone, you surely don't treat them like they're an idiot or flick them a bunch of attitude.", "Someone's fairly upset about mister Brenner asking for Squire Donatella's permission to leave rather than their own. Captain, house superior, ranking member? No, lets get dismissal from someone in the Bisclavret instead.", "First Brenner couldn't be bothered to attend a lecture on courtesy even after he was advised to go by a member of his House's gentry, and then the next thing you know, he's yelling across the commons, informally greeting a Bisclavret Knight. I think he needed that lesson after all..", "Talk about obedient slaves! Apparently Caliste is so well trained that she'll thank the enforcers for keeping her in line. Gives a new meaning to the phrase \\"whipped\\"! But, hey, she's one of the better behaved slaves in the city.", "The constabulary and Bisclavret have always had a somewhat rocky relationship. Now, it looks like Viscountess Kenina is trying to smooth out the relationship... with gifts of alcohol. I can't fault her intentions, but only a Bisclavret would offer Moonshine to anyone other than a commoner!", "Remember the chapel? The one in Docktown? Remember how it was haunted, there were creepy ghostly groans and moans that were coming from under the stairs? The priests are talking about how the moans have returned. Some are calling for exorcists, others are eyeing Cullan and Tomoe suspiciously. I have no idea what's going on!", "Do you know Shirin? I hear she comes from some distant land where men stroke women's hair in public. Simply scandelous! But Shirin knows better, and tells Akomish men not to act inappropriately while here. Akomish? Is that even a word? Does it matter? I hear they are all savages! At least Shirin is civilized! Maybe there is hope for those people.", "Did you know that Xena is a burgher? Maybe that's why she's giving up whiskey. She's not going to rise much higher unless she starts drinking it from a cup instead of a bottle.", "Threats? From Geradan-the-pirate? Business as usual. Except when it chases away business for the seamstresses. Then the pirate is really in trouble, I hear those women are scarier than any navy!", "I overheard that pirates were upsetting seamstresses by making threats in the seamstress shop. And guess which slave was there. The slavers may as well just sell her as a cabin girl and be done with it!", "Tisk. Either get your clothes fitted, Mr Tibbs. Or make threats in back alleys. Being efficient is nice and all, but don't try to do them simultaneously.", "Have you heard about the new woman in town? Perpetua just arrived, but already knows how to speak properly to higher ranks, and remembers to excuse herself before leaving. Personally, I think she's a suck up - but that's what nobles look for, isn't it?", "Geradan? Attending and helping out at courtesy classes? Maybe he really is trying to turn over a new leaf.", "Flynn? Attending and helping out at courtesy classes? It's true, then. Whatever Geradan does, Flynn copies.", "You know Gemma? That rabbit has whatever the opposite of manners are. She even attended a courtesy meeting just to say she doesn't want to listen to it. What would the neighbors think?", "I'm hearing good things about Miss Xena. Either because she's been running courtesy lessons for the commoners. Or because she made Admiral Flynn pretend to be a girl during those lessons. I'm not sure which, but I think I'll start attending.", "Miss Xena spent all morning teaching manners. Do we need these lessons? I ain't had no schooling, but I still know to spit on your hand before shaking.", "Mister Veritas is certainly popular with the lay-dees. Even while attending a courtesy lecture he managed to schmooze with a gentlewoman. At least he was at the courtesy lecture...", "Miss Xena. Teaches courtesy. Every loves her. I'm so bored of hearing about how great she is. Why doesn't anyone ever talk about me and my earwax collection instead?", "You know the city is in a sorry state of affairs when a slave is teaching courtesy to free people. Maybe the slavers need to start whipping the rest of docktown into shape too?", "Word on the street - Fyros was helping answer questions at the courtesy meeting. I might have to find him, and ask which side of my mouth I should belch from. Har ha!", "I hear Kirill is on to a good strategy. He attends courtesy class, then hangs around afterwards to catch up on house affairs. Makes him look well mannered and educated.", "Sir Erwin! He was in the lounge when a courtesy meeting started, and helpfully walked out of the room without even saying a word. What a great way to give the participants an example to discuss how to leave a room properly. What a jape!", "Chesh was asked what he wanted to do, and decided to 'go pick on a few nobles and cause trouble' - commoners, stirring up trouble with nobles? Say it ain't so!", "The seamstresses tell me that Ofello pays his bills promptly, and tips well. And he's so handsome! Wait, the seamstresses think he's handsome, not me.", "Hear about Squire Cullan talking about how his kilt helps him pretend to be a girl? What a whoopsy! For shame, man. A kilt is a very manly garment. What do the other Bisclavret think about you implying they wear skirts?", "Aysun was also at the courtesy lecture. You'd think that the only thing people have to talk about is that darn courtesy meeting! Next time the constabulary report a mugging, I'm sure they'll be talking about how *polite* the mugger was!", "Everyone knows about Sattar, right? But did you know about Donatella? Curling her tail around people? Inviting them to go \\"somewhere private\\"? They're as subtle as each other, a perfect match!", "Shhh, have you heard? Gentleman Mathias has been treating that Doloreaux slave as if she was someone of status. Even holding her elbow while they walked. A gentleman! And a slave! A slave from a rival house! This is perfect fodder for the romantic comedy I'm writing, think Nan might run it as a humerous play?", "Why would a gentlewoman, her fiance, and a Doloreaux slave be walking back and forth through docktown, not even stopping to greet anyone? How strange!", "Why would a Doloreaux slave be wandering around with two betrothed Avoirdupois gentry? And not even trailing behind at a respectful distance, walking with them as if they were all equals. What if children had seen?", "They say that slave, Ryan, is pushy. But I hear he was just trying to get people to help while trying to save Sir Bayard's life. I might not like the knight, but really, that seems reasonable to me. What sort of a person wouldn't help a dying knight?", "The slave Caliste remembered to thank people for their help during the recent medical emergency. That's something which can easily slip your mind, but she remembered. Maybe the rumors that she used to be gentry are true?", "Did you hear that Sir Bayard's heart gave out? And when Veritas was told to help he had a tantrum and said he \\"should have walked on past\\"? I don't think he'll be getting a gift hamper from the ponies this year.", "I hear that horse slave Caliste ended up on her knees and getting dirty while trying to help Sir Bayard. I wouldn't mind her on her knees getting dirty with me, if you know what I mean? What? She's only a slave, lighten up!", "Ha! Funniest thing I heard all day! Veritas got wine splashed in his face. He should know not to insult gentry, they keep drinks ready just in case.", "That slave Ryan gets away with causing so much trouble! I suppose he can do that, after saving the lives of his mistress and a knight.", "Laughing in the face of a gentlewoman? Oh my! I hope Madalina didn't have bad breath.", "Virendra's wife doesn't mind her manners around gentry. But Mister Virendra does correct her behavior. That's what I like to see, a man taking control of his household.", "I know Mister Virendra cheats on his wife. Really, what man doesn't? But you know what's unacceptable? He lets his wife find out, and fight with him about it in public. Make your wife keep it behind closed doors, Vir.", "Ha! So Virendra has a huge public argument with his wife about his mistress. Shocking enough alone. But the next day Shade is cozying up to him. I guess she knows he's easy. But should a woman really be looking for easy men?", " I hear Squire Cullan helped out an old Bisclavret soldier, giving him a cloak and regailing him with honor. Whether or not that honor was owed is up for debate, but still, way to make old men feel useful.", "That Faile sure can give some good examples of how to deal with unruly slaves! Put a hot coal in their mouths so they can't speak for awhile if you have a chatterbox issue. Woo, every day I find more reasons to appreciate my freedom.", "Virendra's always running off to be alone with women other than his wife. At least if he's gonna do that he could practice a little discretion, huh? Pfuh, and they say this man possesses leadership qualities.", "You should see how Senora acts when someone flirts with the Knight Sir Erwin, narrowing her eyes, flattening her ears, and snorting. If you have feelings for a Noble, you should use more discretion and hide it, especially when they're out of your league.", "The other clergy have begun to complain about Bishop Yarwoodle leaving town for extended periods of time. Apparently when he returned this time, he accused Pastor Savryn of stealing from the church. Even more outrageous, they imply he didn't even bother to found out about the Pastor's donations, which more than covered whatever he might have taken out. Or so they say ...", "Baron Althalus really needs to learn to keep his slave in line. I heard she was trying to drag Rankin out of the commons by force, and was bossing everyone around, even demanding that the Sheriff 'go to her office' to see people regarding a crime. What kind of slave has an office and tries to tell free people and Nobles what to do?! Worse, what kind of owner would let her?", "I don't know who that Lia thinks she is. Apparently Rankin was hurt and she demanded to know 'what the hell happened'. After he told her he was attacked in the Turret Tavern by a Noble, she grabbed his arm and attempted to forcibly drag him back to that very same location! Why? Because she claims that's where her office is! I don't know about that, but I certainly wouldn't be trusting the slave of the Noble who tried to hurt me.", "Honestly, how daft can you be? Who in their right mind brashly tells a Countess that they're going to throw her house members out of a wedding?! Esquire Mathias does, and you know .. even if he had a perfectly good reason for it, there are better ways to make your intentions known. Tact, my friends, learn it, practice it, use it.", "I hear Sir Erwin attacked Rankin in response to his assaulting Esquire Lilandra, a Doloreaux gentlewoman. Despite the pirate having a reputation of being a fighter, the Knight allowed him to wake up from a drunken stupor and arm himself before any attacking commenced. While very chivalrous, I have to say .. there are times in a Knight's life and certain people to whom such courtesy shouldn't or doesn't need to be extended.", "During a House meeting, it was suggested that everyone pray for Sir Bayard, as he was most recently ill. Lady Theressa would not allow the request, saying praying needed to only occur during mass. No offense, Lady, but S'allumer listens to you no matter the time or place.", "That Squire Tonozzi is a good friend to have if you're a criminal. I hear she won't rat you out for nothin'!", "Apparently Mister Brenner took a recent Avoirdupois house meeting as an opportunity to attempt to humiliate one of his Knights. He was said to be snorting rudely, making pointed comments about relationships that had nothing to do with matters at hand, and which were private, and then continued to be generally obnoxious. I guess that flogging didn't teach him much after all. Tisk, tisk.", "Someone's still bitter about being removed from his former position, and hes taken a liking to mocking and patronizing Sir Brooks for it. Now, now Brenner, you had your turn. Be a nice horse and share.", "It's not a common occurence for a gentrywoman to try and heft a large man, but miss Brooks did it. After Sir Bayard collapsed with heart problems, she assisted healers in carrying him to the infirmary. Beauty and brawn!", "In the middle of a house meeting, Esquire Mathias had the nerve to refer to Lady Theressa as 'Lady Loveliness'. She is lovely, I have to say, but that's beside the point. He also has been seen removing himself from conversations with his fiance to chat to Countess Aedina alone and unchaperoned. Do you see how my tongue is waggling? That's a bad sign. Perhaps mister Sabot has finally set his attentions to something higher than miss Brooks, and is seeking affection from Nobles.", "That Squire Tonozzi has some brass ones! She explained to Gentleman Sattar, in very clear terms, how the Bisclavret were not amused with his constant breeches of etiquette and of the law, and that if he didn't get in line, woh! Watch out! I'd normally expect a Noble to chide someone of gentry status, but I'm just lowly riff-raff, so what do I know?", "So Doctor Temperance was telling everyone that Anabella is contagious. I didn't know you could catch slavery. What? Oh. She had a disease that was contagious? Then why did the doctor just leave her in a room full of people?", "Did you hear that Cullan kissed his betrothed in public? No, we're not talking about the cheek. I wonder what her father would think?", "You know the rules? Try to use a stick if you have to touch a slave, and always wash your hands afterwards. I heard that Anabella is contagious with... something. Probably slave rot. And she doesn't keep away from crowded places.", "If you see a man wearing a comet-embroidered codpiece, you might want to keep your distance. He's been known to thrust towards peoples faces. His poor wife must be so embarrassed.", "So, remember how I said Doctor Temperance left a contagious patient in the commons with a crowd of people? Maybe I spoke too soon. It seems that Doctor Jahren also feels that the commons is the right place to treat them. I suppose the fountain is a convenient source of water for the doctoring. People drink from that, man!", "Doctor Hush. Seems she's trying to marry into the Doloreaux, and if so, she's going about it the right way. Dating their lieutenant, attending their courtesy lectures. The piggies are really starting to raise their status, aren't they? And is Doctor Hush on the guild council, or not?", "Talk about taking one for the team! It seems the Doloreaux is setting up Lieutenant Lief for an arranged marriage with Doctor Hush. I bet they want to get the university on their side. I don't think it's so bad, Hush can nurse me anytime, if you know what I mean. What if they try the same with the slavers? Who'd want to marry Faile?", "I hear that Doloreaux nobles are going around beating up commoners. Sure, the guy had it coming but... don't nobles usually send their guards, rather than do it themselves? Who can tell the difference between a piggy noble and a piggy commoner?", "Did you hear? I know it happened behind closed doors, but I hear that an Avoirdupois started yelling when asked to pray for the recovery of Sir Bayard. I thought the Avoirdupois were religious!", "So everyone is talking about the nobles that were beating up on a commoner. Yeah, I know they can get away with it, but they were doing it personally! Nobles, sullying themselves with attempted murder! When there are so many assassins without work. You have the money, stop being so miserly! I hope they go to prison, just for the sake of the economy.", "I hear Rankin the Rat's been going around telling everyone that he rules the streets. And, just to prove it, he's been attacking gentry if they forget to bow to him. I'm glad the Doloreaux stepped in. If you ask me, only one way to deal with scum like this. You hold him, I'll hit him!", "Beat up a gentry, get beaten up worse by the Doloreaux. I've heard the boars are tough, stubborn, and loyal to their own. Althalus is a great example of the strengths of the Doloreaux. Only the Doloreaux could let one of their nobles get away with a brawl in the bar without a demotion...", "Wow. A public post complaining that the constables haven't arrested anyone for a crime. When there's no evidence and the constables have no right to arrest. How dare they follow the laws, those fiends! Who would throw around accusations like that? Yeah, most people in the city would. But THIS note was signed by Sattar. And what's more, he even signed it as \\"Gentleman of the Bisclavret.\\" Are the Bisclavret now challenging the Don's laws? This will be interesting!", "Virendra? Yeah, I know he's a freak, but when a commoner tried standing up and tell the nobles to follow the law, he backed them. That's what the Sailor's Guild has always been about! Now let's see if Vir follows through, and keeps the pressure on.", "Did you hear? Sattar lit a cigar! In the library! Why is that news? I don't know. He's a man, men smoke. They especially smoke while at meetings or while reading. Sattar's done so many other things that are way more interesting. I can't imagine *anything* that could be done with a cigar while in a private meeting that would be gossip-worthy.", "This Lord should be chastising his Squire for her terrible manners and poor decorum!

He should be training his Squire in the ways of honor, discretion and manners, not standing by so silently as she takes it upon herself to publicly admonish a man who far outranks her! Has this whole city gone to pieces? How are nobles and genteel persons expected to keep their people in line when they run wild and rampant like a bunch of heathen atavists!? I bet he's asking himself the same question.", "I hear Squire Donatella took it upon herself to publicly chastise Baronet Althalus! As a woman who serves the Nobility of the Bisclavret, she should know that calling a Baronet out on such a public forum is damaging to her credibility and that of her Embassy. She should become educated in honor and proper protocol before she gains any more rank.", "Mister Ramsford stood on the side of evil and wrong-doing, having the nerve to publibly admonish Baronet Althalus' behavior, when the Noble was only standing up for what is right and just! To think that commoners feel so entitled to speak out against their betters. Isn't this what caused the problem in the first place; commoners not minding their station and thinking themselves comparable to the more genteel classes?!

The Rinaldi should be thanking her for all her kindness and warm welcomes.", "Hurrah! Gentleman Sattar stood by the Doloreaux when Rankin slighted their honor. That counts for something, right? Right? Now if only he could learn to stand by and support his own house, that would really be something.", "Even if you're explaining the laws of a city, a Squire should understand the demands of honor and not chastise a Baronet in public or on a public forum for doing what he thinks is right. There does still exist a small thing called discretion, or .. even private conversation, perhaps? A missive? Are these things all becoming things of the past?", "A common street rat threatening and assaulting a gentlewoman? People can scarcely believe that this impertinent scum is still alive, let alone that people are trying to help him! It's a battle of Newtown vs. Docktown .. and I can't wait to see who comes out smelling like roses.", "People are really agitated with Lord Twyrch due to his Squire and her lack of honor. She claimed to be Baronet Althalus' ally and then spoke against him, and even had the tenacity to chastise the Baronet's actions in a public forum! It's great to be a law abiding citizen, there's still propriety and respect you have to observe when you're dealing with your betters.", "More praises for Gentleman Sattar, and all because he supported Baronet Althalus against the comoners with regards to the Noble's obligation to wreak vengeance upon mister Rankin for the unprovoed attack on an unarmed gentrywoman of the Doloreaux.", "Gentleman Sattar spoke out against the Constabulary by calling them incompetent and by supporting the Doloreaux's idea that the Great Houses should be able to handle law matters. I hope the rest of the Bisclavret don't feel that way, because they really should know better; especially that Bisclavret Gentlewoman that was recently sponsored for a promotion by the Rinaldi. Would be a shame to see sponsorships revoked just because someone picked the wrong side ..", "I heard Sir Althalus and Sir Erwin started a manhunt despite it being illegal. As Noblemen and guests of the Rinaldi, they should know better, especially after the Doloreaux and other houses gave their word to support and respect the Constabulary and local law. Maybe it's time the words of the boars are called into question?", "No wonder that Zeiss was excommunicated. He's married, but still complementing other women's... ah... complimenting their backsides. It doesn't sound like he's making an effort to convince the church that he's committed to his marriage.", "You know, at the tournament the Rinaldi high rankers are going to wear their cultural clothing. Want a sneak peak at what they'll be wearing? Just look at Mistress Meepers. They're not meant to be wearing the clothes yet, but she \\"Couldn't help herself.\\" Someone wants to buy me clothes for the tournament, I'll wait until the tournament before wearing them.", "Looking for a good slave? Caliste not only does her job, but goes the extra mile to make sure things are completed properly.", "That Caliste is really a good slave. Staying to help care for that other sick slave...", "Will everyone stop talking about Xena's courtesy meetings? I'm bored already.", "Miss Xena isn't just teaching the commoners courtesy, she's also been getting nice clothing sorted out for the gentry and nobles. Making sure the Rinaldi look their best. Watch out, Brumble, there's a new cat in town!", "Did you hear that Sir Twyrch was coming out of a private room with Donatella? How scandelous... oh, what? Donatella is his squire? Well, I guess that's fine then. But they still should have taken a chaperone when going into private rooms.", "That Ramsford, he took a risk when declaring that nobles are breaking the law. Brave of him, though.", "That stuff about Lord Twyrch? Turns out that his squire was acting without asking him, and he's now taking her in hand. Good to see leadership in action!", "Boy oh boy, that Squire Donatella! Did you see her mouth off at those piggies? I know some would be angry at her for that, but me, I admire her guts. She sure picked a side!", "I may just be a gossiper, but even I know that if Vir licks Meepers ear while in the commons... that's something I'm going to talk about. Shame on them both!", "You know that cat slave, Lia? The one the slavers all hate? I hear they hate her because she always works against them, rather than supporting or helping her masters. But then today I hear that she's given some... useful hints... that could help out one of the slavers. I don't know what she said, but I'm impressed she's helping. What's going on there? What are the slavers up to? Why is Lia now helping? Who is the masked bat? Want to know more, buy me a drink.", "You know Caliste? Some say that slave used to be gentry - that would explain why she's helping Flynn write letters, and teaching him how to avoid upsetting people. I wouldn't mind a slave that could teach me to write.", "Baronet Althalus attacking people? I'm glad that Veritas stood up to them with his declaration. There's a reason the sailors guild are loved by the people!", "Ain't Veritas a nice guy? Any healers that need eucalyptus can go to him for some. I don't know what healers would use eucalyptus for, if you ask me it just smells really funny. I'm suspicious of all these modern medicine fads, bring back the good old days of leeches. At least we knew where we stood.", "Baronet Althalus attacking people? I'm glad that Veritas stood up to them with his public declaration. Do you think he's trying to start a fight to make work for the Sentinels?", "I hear Ramsford's been training a slave, in exchange for the slave tending some of his plants. Sounds like a smart deal to me, and good of him to help out others!", "The university not only teaches medicine, not only treats patients, but also supplies the slaves trained in healing with supplies. I know that hanging out in oldtown is likely to get me stabbed, but now I feel much more secure that a trained healer will be nearby to patch me up afterwards.", "I hear Lord Marcus has been meeting with the Doloreaux, to figure out what to do about that rat Rankin. I had no doubt that Lord Marcus would do the honorable thing, and protect the dignity of nobility.", "Is Luciano a mime now? You should catch his show, he'll mirror whatever a gentry is doing. And he'll call the piggies out as vigilantes. Hilarious! Hilarious, but shameful and inappropriate. Tisk, Luciano. Tisk tisk.", "Land Corporal Cullan is really a star! Someone's being rude, does he draw steel and crack heads? No! He speaks to them, then gets his gentry out of the commons and to somewhere more peaceful. Who says the Doloreaux are vigilantes? Land Corporal Cullan is a masterstudy in masculine restraint! And sexy, too.", "Ramsford, Ramsford, Ramsford. How long do you think the nobles will let your little business thrive, if you go around challenging their authority so publicly? It's not going to change things, either. They're honor-bound to retaliate.", "So Vir has been calling out the Pigs, when they fought back to avenge their honor. But didn't he do exactly the same thing? When Chinco punched his nose? Don't the pigs have much better reason for their actions than Vir did?", "Now Hush has join in criticizing the pigs. I hope the university doesn't rely on nobles for support. But I bet they will get better service from the constables.", "You know Constable Donatella? Yeah, she's not a constable, she just likes to act as if she is. I'm surprised she doesn't still wear the uniform.", "Disfavoring a character that was actually just a rumor...even if it is true...", "I overheard that pirates were upsetting seamstresses by making threats in the seamstress shop. And guess which slave was there. You'd think Gero's wife would keep him in line, instead of joining the trouble.", "Rank sticking with rank, how beautiful. I hear Gentleman Sattar stood up for Baronet Althalus and his attempt to get revenge on the pirate rat Rankin.", "That Lidia's more than willing to find someone who can make jewelry she can't if you want her to. She helped Ramsford make a special engagement ring for Brie, despite how complicated it was.", "Miss Kalda allows men to sit on her while she's lying down, and in public! That's not very appropriate behavior, if you ask me.", "Mister Mort enjoys lounging about on women who are lying down in public areas. Scandalous and inappropriate, I tell you!", "Since his last offenses, mister Chinco has again insulted House Doloreaux, and Lord Marcus personally. He carries arms in public, and even assaulted Sir Erwin! Jeez, man, get it together and learn from your mistakes already.", "Lady Grazia's Handmaid, Wynter, was heard giving advice to Handmaiden Inalla and Esquire Katrina about a Beauty Day, and it was good advice, too. It's so nice to see some of the House's working together.", "Esquire Lilandra understands the position of the commoners in her tiff with mister Rankin, and graciously has admitted that some of the concerns addressed on the public boards are valid. How gracious for a gentlewoman to accept the views of her lessers.", "Gentleman Sattar seems to be learning some manners, and how to be a proper gentleman. He has been seen acknowledging people, and is even more personable, offering cigars before lighting one for himself.", "Mister Rhys has been speaking his peace to the Doloreaux about the Rankin situation and his calling-out on the public boards. It's really something that he's putting forth the effort to soothe any offenses, and incredibly appreciated that he has offered escort to the gentlewomen of the house should they ever need it.", "I heard Veritas was overpaid by a hundred denarii for something, and he took the money back to the person who gave it to him. What an honest chap!", "I hear Mistress Meepers is helping Lady Grazia prepare all the outfits for the upcoming Comet's Fall Festival. Not uncommon for a seamstress to do, but she's handling all the oversight and fine tuning, too.", "Esquire Aysun is aiding the Rinaldi in preparing outfits for the Comet's Fall Festival. Yay for teamwork between the Houses!", "It's really sad that the Doloreaux seem to believe their honor is above the law of the city; laws set down by the Rinaldi, who have graciously offered to host the various' Houses embassies within their own quarters. Baronet Althalus blatantly told Lord Marcus that he and his House would have little faith in the Constabulary if the institution is unable to uphold their honor. Hopefully that doesn't mean the Doloreaux are going to be playing the part of vigilantes yet again.", "Lord Marcus called together a meeting of the nobility and various representatives of each house to discuss matters of the city and its law, and to determine what should be done in cases like the one between the Doloreaux and mister Rankin. It's quite pleasing that he took it upon himself as head of the Rinaldi to call everyone together for a group resolution.", "It's sad that the Baronet has such little faith and trust in city law and the people protecting it.  How can he expect the system to work if he bypasses it completely and doesn't encourage charges be pressed for a crime so that it can be brought before a magistrate? Many believe the system doesn't work because of individuals like him who deem to take the law into their own hands and ignore the systems put in place.", "Esquire Aysun seems to think that the word of a gentry woman is no more valuable than the word of a commoner. Gentry are honorable beings, and do not utter falsehoods which would demean their station.", "That Luciano sure likes to stir up trouble! He wanted to go and crash the Noble's meeting just because he was bored.", "I hear Luciano tried to get Rankin to go with him and cause some trouble for the Nobles during their fancy meeting. Surprisingly, mister Rankin resisted all the provocations and temptation.", "Interested in black magic? Well, Geradan's not, and if you ask him, he'll tell you that it's something to be shunned.", "Doctor Hush risked disfavor from the Doloreaux by publicly supporting Ramsford on the public boards. Wait .. didn't Baronet Althalus recently give her permission to court one of his own house members?", "People have no brains anymore. I hear that Virendra confessed to the commons that he used black magic on himself.", "Virendra's been prattling off about black magic, and how he tried it and failed. Who cares if the Church already knows? It's evil, and bad!", "Miss Lianaar is no fan of black magic, and she told Virendra there wasn't any excuse for using it. Suitable that she should be so appalled.", "Lord Marcus has been extending some of his duties to other members of the Rinaldi, and has been working on improving house relations, making people feel important and needed. Yay for delegation!", "Lord Twyrch apologized for the actions of his Squire in chastising Baronet Althalus and Sir Erwin, stating that she hadn't acted with full support of the House. It's a good thing to see Nobles taking responsibility for the actions of their house members and trying to right wrongs.", "Sir Ewrin avails himself to any noble in need, carrying packages and escorting Ladies to-and-fro. What a gentleman!", "Veritas helped carry a wounded Knight of the Avoirdupois to the infirmary, even after the house had dishonorably discharged him. He had class enough to help desite his persoal feelings and disagreements.", "I hear miss Amata knows how to speak sheep, and she'll teach you without asking anything for it in return.", "Mister Ramsford offered to teach a slave how to garden for free in exchange for her caring for some plants for an upcoming event. He didn't even wait long enough to learn that someone was willing to pay him for his trouble.", "Esquire Katrina is really good at ignoring taunts and not lowering herself to petty arguments in the commons. Shame on mister Luciano for trying to drag her down to his level!", "Sir Erwin has been engaging in unnecessary arguments with the likes of miss Elizabeth. He's a Noble, and is therefore always right in what he's saying, so there's no need for him to be lowering himself by bickering with commoners.", "Mister Ice likes to make fun of people's impairments in public. I heard he was teasing Sang about his hiss, and that's just completely impolite.", "I've never heard of such things .. but Ice apparently likes to go about kissing other men. How many different kinds of wrong can you be?", "Luciano has a love for imitations. He likes to mock Esquire Katrina for public entertainment, for example. Making fun of a gentrywoman? Probably not the best way to make a denar.", "Esquire Aysun is one smart cookie! She responded to declarations on the public boards in person to her Nobles, and managed to maintain a neutral stance in all disagreements, while still supporting the law of Triskellian.", "Esquire Cullan responded to his Noble's declaration on the public boards through missive, and agreed to abide by the stance to stay neutral in any disagreements stemming from the Doloreaux and Rankin subject.", "Luciano took to insulting Elizabeth in the commons, even going so far as to make suggestive remarks about how women are 'used'. We all know how women are useful, we don't need an itemized list of skills.", "Esquire Katrina went to Lord Marcus and told him why the Doloreaux really decided to attack Rankin, and assured him it wasn't a statement against the competency of the Constabulary. At least someone in the Doloreaux isn't attacking the law enforcement in this city.", "Sir Erwin let Lord Marcus know that Baronet Althalus does support the Constabulary, despite his decision to seek other means of justice. How can you really blame a Knight for defending the honor of his house?", "Gentleman Sattar was groping his wife's breast in the commons, talking about something nice and light. So much for his having progressed from previoius behavior. Groping in public is bad, mmkay.", "While her husband, Gentleman Sattar, was fondling her bosom inappropriately in the commons, Shaharazad just giggled at him and issued some playful swats in retaliation. That's an interesting way for a wife to discourage poor behavior, huh? I'm certain he felt sufficiently chided and discontinued his tasteless actions. Oh wait, no he didn't.", "If you think something is wrong with Esquire Lilandra, it's probably best not to ask. If you do, she'll tell you nothing, and then if you press her, she'll complain about how life is utterly unfair and her efforts are pointless. Here I thought gentry people were blessed by the Light, and not prone to being needlessly overdramatic.", "Esquire Aysun only supported the Contabulary during the meeting of the Great Houses and agreed that people need to respect and follows laws without exception. I bet the Rinaldi are just tickled purple to have the Bisclavret on their side.", "Sir Twyrch made it a point to smooth over issues with the Rinaldi concerning his house's Gentleman Sattar. I wonder how much more smoothing over will occur before the Bisclavret run out of ways to apologize.", "Mister Brenner tastelessly left in the middle of a courtesy lecture and even had the nerve to advertise his own session on courteous dueling before leaving without a bow or proper parting note. Some people!", "Mister Gegnar is always punctual when providing escorts for his house, and won't take any coin as compensation. The city needs more loyal folk like him around.", "Miss Aluine seems to think Miss Faile kills and beats slaves all day long, and thus must not be a follower of the Light. Faile was recognized by the church for her devotion to religion, and even if she hadn't been, there still wouldn't be anything wrong with her occupation. Slavery here is just as common as breathing air. It's such a shame that people like Aluine, who claim to be followers of the light themselves, are willing to judge others they don't know so swiftly.", "Baronet Althalus openly and publicly flouted the laws of Triskellian by creating a mob to track down the rat Rankin, without even reporting that a crime occurred to the Constabulary at all. It's disgraceful that a Noble would act in such a way, especially since so many look to people of rank for good examples.", "Gentleman Sattar's attitude has improved greatly as of late! He has been saying please, thank you, and even bids people Light's blessings. It's almost too good to be true ..", "What a gentleman Sir Brooks is. I heard he ordered a new outfit to attend Esquire Cerridwyn's debutant ball, and included a sash of periwinkle to match her dress and honor her family. Now that's how you win favor from the father of a woman you wish to marry.", "Mister Ice is still chasing boys for kisses in public. If you're interested in unique relationships, you at least ought to keep them private.", "Miss Taraji has a generous and giving spirit. She doesn't make much, but what she gets she shares with the beggars. Just look how heavy my pouch is, and it's partially thanks to her!", "That Esquire Katrina is great at communicating. She helped smooth over a conflict between Doctor Hush and the Doloreaux, even though she didn't have to, and she managed to do it before things escalated.", "Say what you will about Cincin's eccentricity, but she makes the best steeple hats in the city, and people love them!", "I hear Esquire Katrina is funding church sermons to try and improve the lives and attitudes of those in Docktown.", "Chinco's willing to teach other people's friends how to fish for free. Must be something up with the water in Docktown.", "More and more people are telling me about Gentleman Sattar's inappropriate and lewd behavior in the commons with his wife. I know they're married, but I'm surprised he would disrespect her and her body so openly, and that she would allow it.", "Esquire Katrina is at it again, swiftly reacting to a situation in which an ally of the Doloreaux unintentionally spoke against the house. Because of the Esquire's contact and conversation with said person, a stronger alliance was forged and all issues remedied.", "Ramsford's obvious fondness, devotion, and faithfulness to Brie is remarkable, and a rare case of how love can and should be in a city where love is a commodity.", "It seems mister Dylan uninvitedly gave input to students taking a gardening lesson, and when the teacher asked that he be able to do the teaching without interruption, the Dean left in a huff, complaining about being excluded. He didn't even pay attention to the invitation to join the group in the garden, but I guess that's how it goes.", "Miss Aluine enjoys preaching in public that slavery is evil. That sort of statement just entirely ignores the economical stand of society on the matter, and creates chaos while trying to ruin an institution that lives are built on.", "Tomoe is really good about helping out newcomers with starting materials and a list of contacts based on their interests.", "Miss Stuart, while being closely associated with mister Chinco, testified against him at the request of Lord Marcus. It's good to see that girl knows which side to pick when it comes to the law.", "That mister Swan is terrible with personal finance. I hear he's owed some lass ten denarii for weeks now and can't even scrape that much together. I guess being a sailor don't pay like it used ta.", "That Mini'll sleep with anyone. She's always dragging strangers to her bed, even married men, without any cares in the world.", "Mister Virendra swore to stop having mistresses and be faithful to his pregnant wife, but hes been seen slipping off with Minni regularly, and she's known to be the loose sort.", "If you're looking for an unabashed prostitute, miss Prudence is your girl. She'll try really hard to make you a customer!", "Miss Prudence has been spotted acting like a whore in the commons, being real suggestive with her body and verbal comments. Watch out boys!", "Sir Erwin is oh-so-attentive with Dame Grazia, escorting her everywhere since the start of their courtship, and upholding a shining display of decorum and propriety. Now there's an example people need to pay attention to!", "Either Miste Ice is completely loony, or honest to a fault. He went into the Docktown Chapel and proclaimed himself a lover of men and a former assassin. Can you imagine? I bet the priests just wanted to faint.", "Clergyman Ramses apparently overreacted to someone putting rubbish in the donation box, even threatening to call down the power of the Light on him! What a way to make people fear religion.", "Mister Dolon has shown a good understanding of the Light and of faith, and keeps well to his beliefs. He knows that S'allumer will always find a way to provide for his flock, and he's more than glad to tell you so.", "Surprise, surprise. Mister Ice is still trying to kiss on men in the middle of the commons. I'm actually pretty tired of talking about it. Suffice to say if you're a man and you seem him in the vicinity, be prepared.", "That miss Izzy sure doesn't care about public displays of affection and how uncomfortable they make others. People say she's been snuggling and kissing in full view of them, and they don't like it one bit!", "That Doctor Jahren sure doesn't care about public displays of affection and how uncomfortable they make others. People say hes been snuggling and kissing in full view of them, and they don't like it one bit!", "Doctor Hush made the case of House Doloreaux at the latest Guild Council meeting and explained how vile mister Rankin was. I guess it's good the Doloreaux have allies, but wasn't she just the ally of mister Rankin a week ago? Boy, people sure do confuse me.", "Mister Dylan is always stocking the tents with high quality fabrics and materials for low prices to help those crafters who can't acquire the goods themselves. It's right nice of him.", "Ryan is already making a good serf! I hear he brings Sir Brooks dinner on a regular basis, and that now that he can carry his own money, he doesn't need to be told to do the right thing, he just does them. That's proof that promotions work, and that he was deserving.", "Miss Izzy seems to think slaves have rights, which they don't. Shes also been criticizing the enforcers for doing their job, which don't make much sense at all. Can you imagine what kind of slaves we'd have without enforcers? I'm scared just thinking about it.", "Doctor Jahren interfered with the whipping of a slave and took Ryan away from the punishment he was about to receive just because he didn't think it was fair. Talk about stepping out of one's place. I'm sure the enforcers know what's fair and what isn't when it comes to slaves; that's their job after all.", "That Sheriff Joshua has done unending work for the Constabulary and has been capably handling some of mister Luciano's recent crimes. He should have been a horse so he could be referred to as a work horse! No, but seriously, he does a lot more than most people and doesn't get enough recognition for it.", "That miss Nuit had the nerve to step into the chapel without paying any respects whatsoever. She followingly was noisy and discourteous while others were praying, and further speaks negatively about the smaller building, comparing it in an unfavorable way to the Newtown Cathedral. It doesn't matter how beautiful a building is, it matters what's in the hearts of the people who occupy it.", "Mister Akash entered the Docktown chapel and failed to pay any sort of respects whatsoever. Afterward, he was noisy and discouteous while others were praying. If you want to chat and be loud, you don't go into a religious building to do it.", "Deputy Krell is quick and professional when taking testimonies. People are really appreciating that. Yay Constables!", "Miss Nuit agreed to train some of mister Veritas' employees, and saved him a load of money in the process. She was even modest enough to suggest the amount he offered in compensation was too much. So, if you're wanting some training and don't want to pay large sums, you should seek her out and see what kinda deal she'll offer.", "Mistress Meepers has shown constant attention to Lady Grazia, and has even been helping with handing out the rewards for the recent clothier's contest.", "People have been hearing Ryan speak out of his station about Gentleman Sattar, and how poor his behavior is. Regardless of whether it's true or not, slaves need to remember their place.", "Miss Elgin went along as a guard for the troupe that was celebrating Ryan's recent promotion. She even went so far as to provide money to buy pies so nobody had to walk back to the bank. What a good house member!", "If you ask Mistress Meepers to file a testimony to something she witnessed, she's right on it! She did so for Lord Marcus in a very prompt manner, which is always helpful.", "Mister Luciano has been making inappropriate comments to Avoirdupois Nobility, going so far as to tell them to take stools out of their behinds and get out of Docktown. He has even threatened violence, which isn't surprising, but is still unacceptable.", "More people are complaining about mister Luciano telling Sir Brooks and Sir Erwin to kiss his backside and sit on the stool rather than bedding it. What does that even mean anyway?", "Gentleman Sattar refused to give Sir Brooks an apology after he offended him, and even after Sir Erwin told him to. He pressed the offense by rattling off to the Noble about how his slave, Ryan, was undeserving of his recent promotion.", "Sir Erwin attempted to get Gentleman Sattar to apologize and behave appropriately to Sir Brooks after the gentleman was rude. Considering how often the Doloreaux and Avoirdupois are at odds, it's nice to see them stick up for each other on occasion.", "That slave Marcel has a nasty habit of cursing and talking inappropriately about people of a higher station, including Nobility and his own master, in front of random other people who outrank him. You'd think he'd have learned by now when to keep quiet.", "Luciano was in the commons making rude and lewd comments to miss Irene. When she retorted, he drew his blade and started threatening her, demanding she apologize. She didn't, and so he ended up stabbing her. Stabbing a woman in public! Can you imagine? And one who isn't even armed. What is the city coming to?", "Miss Lianaar is always generous and ever proper. I hear she gave Esquire Katrina some lovely new perfume for no reason at all other than to show some kindness.", "Miss Aluine claims that you can't be a devout follower of the Light when you are engaged in slave trading! Doesn't she know that slavery was supported by the Church from the very beginning?", "Apparently miss Lia thinks anybody who goes to be treated by Doctor Hush are either morons or they're sleeping with her, or both. I wonder what Doctor Hush thinks about a slave speaking of her that way?", "Mister Dylan has a knack for interrupting lessons and then trying to take them over, even if his opinion isn't invited. If you want to teach, it might be a good idea to get your own students.", "That Mister Dylan is something else! Even though Lia's only a slave, he took time out of his busy schedule to teach her about plants and herbs, and even spoke to the herb shop clerk so she'd get access to the back garden.", "Gentleman Sattar has been saying thank you to people lower ranked than him. Has he seen the Light? Is he ill? I don't know, but thank you is a good place to start rebuilding his reputation.", "Some of the recent gossip about mister Ice was incorrect. Apparently he never said anything negative in the chapel itself, just in the commons, which is still bad, but not as bad. I guess he has a little courtesy in him after all.", "Mister Ramsford's engagement party was said to be jolly good fun, and I hear it wasn't invite only, but everyone was encouraged to join and partake in goodies. How generous!", "That Miss Noire helped out a recently engaged fellow by counciling him through some worries he had about his lack of religion and how it will affect his relationship. She's real good about answering questions, or finding out necessary information to share with the people who need it. The Church sure is lucky to have folk like her.", "Mister Ramsford arranged for an open party with an elaborate selection of food and drinks. He even provided an opportunity for the people of Docktown to dance to music! Now that's something work speaking of.", "That Mister Kolgrim sure knows how to treat women and pamper them with all the proper pleasantries. If you dance with him, he'll really dish out the flattery.", "Don't know how to dance? Say it isn't so! Mister Bernard can teach you; in fact, he spent most of his time teaching people how to move rhythmically at a recent engagement party, which was right nice of him.", "Not only does he ask unsuspecting women to dance, but Mister Kolgrim also pays attention to them throughout their time together, engaging in conversation and treating them nicely.", "Mister Ramsford arranged a public event and invited all of the town to celebrate his engagement. He provided food and drinks, music, and a good mood!", "That Mister Ice sure can overreact! He got angry in the commons talking about miss Prudence and said that he was going to cut her into pieces! Well, at least the Constabulary knows who to blame if something happens to the lass.", "I heard miss Prudence went into the brewery and starting goading a girl into a fight, calling her a whore, and mocking her clothes. Heh. Takes one to know one, what?", "More talk about miss Prudence trying to pick fights and making people leave where they're socializing to avoid issues. At least if she's gonna be trouble she could do something different from time to time.", "Handmaiden Inalla sent one of her gentrywomen a new, pretty fan, completely of her own accord. That's the kind of generosity that moves you up in the world.", "People don't seem to honor Dimache much anymore, but Admiral Flynn went and prayed like a devout follower of the Light should.", "The Mistress honored Dimache by praying in the chapel, like all devout followers of the Light should.", "Miss Naomi refused to pray in the chapel, panicked when she entered the holy building, and then fled before she said any prayers at all. Kinda makes you wonder, huh?", "Mister Jace honored Dimache by praying in the chapel, like all devout followers of the Light should.", "Miss Noire honored Dimache by praying in the chapel, like all devout followers of the Light should.", "Have you heard that Brie gives a discount for regular customers? I wish I could buy clothes often enough to be considered a regular.", "Do you know that the Rainbow Rags offer free clothes for new arrivals in the city? Yeah, if you meet a new person, just check the racks in the seamstress shop to find clothes for them. That Brie works hard to keep them stocked.", "I hear that Lady Grazia is quite pleased with how Xena stepped up to take care of the tournament and festival while she was away.", "You know, all the best people patron the arts. Xena is stepping up as well, commissioning a new statue for the city.", "Man, that Xena again. Standing up to Baronet Althalus, and taking him to task for assuming that the legal system should just automatically assume nobles are in the right. I know they trust nobles words more than ours, but I'm glad we're not instantly assumed to be guilty! Thanks to people like Xena fighting for the law. I bet she's glad she works for the Rinaldi, and not to Doloreaux about now.", "Did you hear that Esquire Lilandra first said that she didn't recognize her attacker? And now says it was Rankin? It seems to me that either she was told to say it was Rankin, or else she was too afraid in the first place to say who attacked her. Either way, I feel for the poor woman.", "Have you seen that muscular leopard around? Looking so fancy in his constabulary uniform? And now turning up to represent the constables. Now there's a man on the up-and-up.", "Have you heard what Sir Erwin said? He said he didn't care what trouble would come from going after Rankin, and he only cared about the safety of his house members. And that he'd accept whatever punishment that awards him. Now, that.", "Have you heard what Sir Erwin said? He said he didn't care what trouble would come from going after Rankin, and he only cared about the safety of his house members. And that he'd accept whatever punishment that awards him. Now, that's truly knightly behavior!", "Everyone heard about the meeting that Marcus organized. Getting all four houses and the constables together, and handling all the issues that came up. Move over, Don We've got a new Rinaldi diplomat!", "Brie tells me that Mister Rhys always pays bills on time. And here I was thinking that this city ran on debt...", "So, I walk into the boarding house lounge, and what do I see? A male rabbit. Sitting on top of some woman. Ugh! There are plenty of other chairs, or could have borrowed some from the severed tail if they'd run out.", "Did you hear? Esquire Katrina is sponsoring Xena? But only if she continues to hold the courtesy lectures. Smart move, Katrina. Now all the courtesy lectures are being held by the same group of people. The power! The control! What if they start telling everyone to wear pants on their heads? I bet it'd be the next fashion.", "Mister Ramsford is such a romantic! He got down on one knee when proposing to Brie. It's just like a fairytale!", "Need a wedding ring? Lidia's the girl for you!", "Does Taraji work for the church? I hear she's been giving money to the beggars.", "Mister Dylan helped gather healing supplies to aid the Doctors in treating people injured by the fire. Extra hands and extra helpers are always good.", "You hear that Virendra admitted that he was having affairs with \\"ladies\\", when he thought Maddy had run off on him? I know everyone has affairs, but you'd think that, for the sake of decency, he'd just lie and claim he was chaste.", "Sir Bayard is such a brave Knight! He charged right into the Severed Tail to assist with putting out the fire. No other Nobles were anywhere in sight.", "Enunciation is a good thing; unfortunately, miss Taraji only knows how to enunciate improper words like 'ass'. You shouldn't walk around calling people that, nope. It's the rudeness.", "Esquire Cerridwyn will make a fine wife. She shows proper modesty, or so I'm told. Not like all these commoner women.", "I hear that Brie is friends with some slaves, and offered to pay their masters to cover their work for the evening, so the slaves would be free to attend her engagement party.", "That Ofello Behr is one brave soul! I hear he ran straight into the blazing Severed Tail to aid Sir Bayard who was trying to put out the flames. See? You don't have to be part of a House to do the right and proper thing.", "What's that grizzly's name? Dylan? After the fire at the Severed Tail, he went running around gathering healing supplies for the Doctors while they were busy with all of the injured. I bet they really appreciated the extra help.", "Miss Nuit was out and about tending to the injured after the fire in the Severed Tail. I don't know if she's a healer or not, but it sure was swell of her to help out anyway.", "What is with Lions in this city? With one notable example, they seem to have no manners at all. Take that Akash, making comments at Miss Xena about how she's boring and he only likes her for her looks. And continually interrupting her because he's not paying attention during courtesy lessons. I wonder if lions know what the word \\"Ironic\\" means?", "Caliste is one polite slave! She even wrote a note to Dean Dylan apologizing for Ryan and Ramsford's behavior. I wonder if those two know she's apologizing for them, and I wonder what they'd think about it. Maybe they'd appreciate it, maybe they'd be annoyed, maybe Caliste sometimes forgets she's no longer gentry. But Dean Dylan seems happier now, so that's good.", "Doctor Jahren kept cozy in his line of work and helped tend to the injured after the fire in the Severed Tail was put out. Glad to know there was a trained medic on site.", "Seems lots of people appreciated miss Nuit helping out with the injured from the recent fire. It's so heart-warming to know the city is full of such caring and helpful people.", "Did you hear that Caliste managed to get Flynn to take a bath. I don't mean just washing his hears, but actually totally getting into the water. I wish more sailors had slaves that would make them bathe.", "Miss Opal was amongst the many helping tend to injured persons after the fire in the Severed Tail. Whew, sounds like patients had more than enough attention this time.", "Did you hear that Caliste managed to get Flynn to take a bath. What's more, Flynn then wore the clothes that Caliste had brought, and thanked her afterward. Being a yeoman has certainly improved his manners.", "That Mister Bernard managed to hurl a barrel of water at the fire in the Severed Tail when a team of people tried before him and couldn't manage. What a big help, and wow, those muscles!", "Doctor Jahren was really good about promptly seeing to the medical needs of people hurt in the Severed Tail fire. I guess that's why he's a doctor, eh?", "Talk about brisk! Miss Opal was flitting here and there, promptly seeing to the medical needs of people afflicted by the Severed Tail fire.", "That miss Noire ran and bought an overpriced barrel of water to put out the fire in the Severed Tail! I hope she knows that her generosity was appreciated and that the lives she helped save are priceless.", "Ryan was running back and forth gathering water to put out the Severed Tail fire with. It's a good thing bunnies are great and fast hoppers!", "Jahren is a true doctor, thinking on the future of the town. I hear he kept doses of spider itch cures, so when Flynn obtained it, the cure was at hand before the plague got out of hand again.", "Surely you've seen that Prudence female milling about. I hear she recieved a brand-spanking-new outfit from Miss Brie, and how was she repayed? With a scroll saying she forgot the stockings! How rude is that?", "Ryan risked his life trying to help extinguish the fire raging in the Severed Tail. He might just be a serf, but it still takes bravery to act like he did.", "A married man should mind his reputation, and bring no shame to his wife. Allowing women to kiss his jaw in public is certainly not the way to go about it.", "Aun unmarried woman should mind her reputation. Kissing married men, such as Flynn, on their jaw in public is certainly not the way to go about it.", "Mister Bernard was amonst the many who risked his life trying to help put out the fire in the Severed Tail. I bet all the people sleeping cozily in their rooms are thanking him as much as the people who saw him in action are!", "Mister Ramsford risked his life trying to help extinguish the fire that raged through the Severed Tail. It looks like hiim and many others will get to see another day thanks to his bravery!", "One of the ways not to woo a woman is to tell her that you have a friend that smells worse than she does. Someone should tell that to Kolgrim.", "Mister Leif gallantly offered to escort Dame Valara of the Avoirdupois about town to ensure her safety. Now that's a good and proper guard.", "I hear mister Bruno let mister Ofello take over his guild and either didn't bother to mention that certain members were being trained, or actively supported removing the ability of certain members to better their craft. Either way, that doesn't seem like good business, taking away people's means of progressing in their field after they have committed themselves to working for you.", "What sort of gentleman purposefully insults an Avoirdupois Knight? And if that wasn't the worse part, when a Doloreaux suggested he apologize, Sattar gave the stink-eye to Sir Brooks and claims to owe him no apology.", "Mister Ofello apparently took over the Hands of St. Trahern and his first order of business was to completely cut out pay and the ability to train with the teachers. He didn't even send out courtesy notes to his members to inform them of what was going on! People are starting to whisper that the guild is just using them to bring in money without offering any benefits. Oh my, that doesn't bode well.", "That Miss Brie is the role model of all young ladies in the city. If everyone valued their relationships and their partner as much as she does, the world would be a perfect place.", "Any new arrivals needing help adjusting to city life don't have a thing to worry about, with Caliste on the job. The best part is, she will be discreet about it.", "People are starting to believe Ice is insane. He giggles randomly in important conversations, wanders around aimlessly .. oh! And he claims to work for the church, while also being an ex-assassin who likes to self-admittedly bed men. Is it just me, or does it sound like the church will hire just about anyone these days?", "A small group of people were talking about a church member who had been acting sinful and insane. Miss Tomoe simply got up and walked out of the conversation without a concern at all about the church, a fellow church member, or preserving the ideals of S'allumer. This is supposedly a woman who works for the Faith! The nerve!", "Did you go to Miss Brie's and Mister Ramsford's engagement party? Neither did I, but I heard it was a hoot. There were free food and drinks, music, and a friendly atmosphere.", "That Sir Brooks is something else, in a good way! Sheriff Joshua was stressing out a bit about his upcoming promotion ceremony, and the Avoirdupois Knight sat all evening in the lounge helping him write up a speech. That's such a selfless sacrifice of precious time.", "What an engagement party that was! Not only was there an elaborate selection of food and drinks, it was open to the town and there was an opportunity to dance the night away!", "Even after mister Luciano insulted Esquire Katrina and got off with a warning, he contined to insult Sir Erwin and Sir Brooks, and even assaulted mister Veritas and miss Irene. There is just no end to this man's recklessness and poor behavior!", "The engagement party miss Brie and mister Ramsford held was jolly good fun! There was dancing, food--REALLY good food, drinks, and a lot of socializing! And they didn't even make it invite-only, everyone was encouraged to join! How generous of them!", "Esquire Katrina is so patient. She'll wait for the attention of freeman who have other things to do than tend to her, and she'll do it without complaint!", "Did you hear that if miss Xena really likes you, she'll give you a sound smack? I hope she doesn't start liking me anytime soon!", "That Caliste slave really is something special! She risked her life trying to help put out the fire in the Severed Tail, then even stayed behind to clean the place up!", "Bunnies aren't the only ones that can bounce around when on a mission. Caliste dashed to and from the Severed Tail, ferrying water in to help put out the blaze. Aren't we all lucky to have such useful slaves around?", "Did you hear about when Veritas stepped up and defended a woman Luciano was harassing and making lewd comments to? It's a good thing there are still a few decent men around.", "Can you believe Mister Cullan covered up for his housemate Gentleman Sattar and apologized for any offenses he may have caused? If you ask me, Gentleman Sattar is really lucky there are some in his House that are willing to pick up his slack. If I were Cullan, I wouldn't have bothered.", "That Luciano is up to no good as usual. I heard he found a group of people in the brewery patio, one of them being Sir Brooks, and said aloud that the Avoirdupois need to take the stools out of their.. rears. How tasteless!", "The slaves under Doctor Hush's ownership have it good. To celebrate Ryan's promotion to serfdom, Hush and Sir Brooks gave him enough money to buy everyone drinks, then they said toasts and offered kind words of praise for all his hard work and efforts. It's no wonder Ryan is behaving better with owners like that.", "Mister Ramsford is very inclusive with people, even if they've take offense to something he's said in the past.", "I heard that despite her close relationship with Chinco, that she testified against him on his charge. Smart of her to go with Lord Marcus on that one, appropriate too.", "Not only was she rude enough to eavesdrop on other peoples' conversations, Tomoe shows absolutely no initiative whatsoever in resolving problems. It's little wonder the people are starting to lose faith in the city clergy.", "That Prudence woman must be dying for attention, going around touching men without permission, then continuing to do so even after being told to stop. Just what is her problem?", "Did you hear that Brenner hosted his own courtesy class? Only unlike Xena's, it was about courteous dueling, which isn't something the general populace appears to be educated in. At least he is stepping up and doing something productive and beneficial to the city.", "I heard Ofello and Bruno Smith donated a heap of weapons, armors and shields to the Rinaldi to thank them for their hospitality and alliance with their guild. How generous of the two of them.", "I heard Bruno Smith and Ofello donated a heap of weapons, armors and shields to the Rinaldi to thank them for their hospitality and alliance with their guild. How generous of the two of them.", "That Ice sure has a filthy mouth! He threatened to cut Prudence to pieces, only referring to Prudence as.. well.. a really horrible name. Use your imagination!", "Miss Lianaar is incredibly thoughtful! While everyone else brought gifts only for the bride-to-be at Brie and Ramsford's engagement party, she was the only one who gave them a gift as a couple. And if that wasn't enough, she gave an entire speech dedicated to wishing them well in their future. How great is she!", "Cincin came bearing gifts to Brie and Ramsford's engagement party, but these gifts had meaning behind them. Couldn't tell you what they were, I didn't ask. She also gave them wise advice to follow while going into marriage.", "Isn't the purpose of Xena's courtesy classes to learn how to be courteous? That's what I thought, so why would someone attend and purposefully be rude? Someone should ask that Vincent fellow.", "I heard Ramsford attended Xena's courtesy lesson for the first time, the one about business and such, I think. He asked questions and involved himself in the discussion, which was very beneficial to the rest in attendance. I'm glad more and more people are feeling humble enough to accept improvement.", "A supposed man of the light, mister Gizzard walked through a courtesy gathering and said Light keep you safe, heaven knows you all need it. Religion is hard enough without people being so passingly judgmental.", "Did you hear? Admiral Flynn went crazy at Xena's courtesy meeting! Well, crazy may be stretching it, but he kept focusing on things that weren't there, then exclaiming that he was going to kill someone. In his defense though, one of the merchants told me something might have been slipped into his drink.", "Serfdom doesn't appear to be going to Ryan's head! You should have seen him, like a lightning bolt, carrying water to the Severed Tail to help put out the fire. Still as dutiful as he was when he was a slave.", "Have you heard of Mac? He valiantly assisted in the extinguishing of the fire in the Severed Tail! He sure made the Doloreaux look good with that, methinks.", "Ofello isn't just good for smithing weapons. You can count on him if another fire breaks out to jump in and lend a hand.", "Did you hear that the Spider Itch reared its ugly head again? But don't worry, it was swiftly dealt with. Ryan applied it to Admiral Flynn to cure him, risking getting infected himself. What a good example of self-sacrifice!", "Bad attitude or not, at least Vincent showed up to the courtesy lecture, which is more than what many others do. Whether or not he learned anything, though, is still unknown.", "Ryan treated Admiral Flynn for the spider itch at risk to himself. Awwz, what a good brother he is.", "Seen Noire at the courtesy lectures. She's quite the lady.", "Admiral Flynn selflessly refused medical care for himself until after the fire in the Severed Tail was safely put out. Lets just hope nobody got spider itch whie he was waiting for treatment.", "Admiral Flynn does a great job keeping all the slaves under his charge in line and well disciplined. At the same time he is very forgiving and reasonable when dealing with unruly slaves who are really apologetic. Hopefully he doesn't get too soft though, don't want the slaves thinking they can get away with everything.", "Did you hear that Admiral Flynn refused medical care until the fire was put out? I guess it comes from being a sailor, where a fire onboard threatens everyone.", "You heard that slave, Ryan, talk about his mother? With the most foul language! I'm sure it's true, but still... trust a slave to say it out loud.", "Xena is being promoted, but why is she going to the Bisclavret for a sponsor? Don't the Rinaldi have anyone appropriate?", "You know how Zoe is always punctual with her carpentry work? I hear on the odd occasions when she's running late she also gives discounts.", "I'm told that Cullan is helpful to nobles. But I have no idea what he does for them...", "Zoe helped donate items for the upcoming auction. What item? Attend the auction and see!", "Only nodding to gentry and even knights? Yeah, that's not really polite. But Chesh is just a freedman, so I don't think anyone cares too much, heaps of freedmen don't bother bowing. Even if they should. At least Chesh nodded to them.", "You heard about Chesh just nodding to knights? Yeah, I know, nobody really expects different since Chesh is just a freedman. But Veritas? Sometimes he barely even nods. Why should we care about Veritas and not Chesh? I guess we shouldn't, but I hear that he's going to get promoted soon. Maybe he'll start being more formal when he's a yeoman.", "I hear that even other slaves are complaining about Eldro, how he never helps clean the trash and how his mistress always coddles him. Ha! At least now the slaves are bitching about someone other than Marcel.", "Heard about Prudence... uh... propositioning men in public? Isn't it normally the men propositioning the women? At least, that's how it should be if you ask me!", "Isn't it nice when new arrivals to the city make an effort to earn what they are given? This one guy named Kildarien was actually mugged on his way to town, but instead of being mopey about his bad luck and accepting freebies, helped Ramsford run errands in exchange for coin.", "That mister Cullan is not only a dutiful and proper member of the Bisclavret, he is quite the gentleman! In addition to checking in with Countess Aedina to make sure she is well and not in need of anything, he offered to heft a heavy instrument around for her. How nice!", "Ryan is really helpful, if you have questions regarding promotions. Why, just the other day, he was coaching Caliste on how to handle promotions, going so far as to suggest names for potential sponsors. Does that mean Caliste is going to get promoted soon? It's almost a shame, she is such a good slave.", "That Leif needs to keep his private and public lives separate! No one wants to watch him display intimacy with his woman, has he no shame?", "You'd think that with the recent promotion to yeoman, Doctor Hush would display a little more taste when out in public and discussing business with others. She just up and allowed Leif to lick her ear, it's outrageous!", "Did you see what Leif did, right in the middle of the commons? He licked Doctor Hush's ear while she was in a conversation with someone! Not only is that rude, it's gross!", "I heard from a sailor that he saw Leif licking Doctor Hush's ear, right in public, while she was engaged in business with someone. Not only that, she didn't even bother to correct him UNTIL she saw the negative reaction it got. She is going to have to step it up, now that she isn't a commoner anymore.", "At least Doctor Hush had the sense to reprimand Leif for his display of unacceptable public affection.", "I heard from the milk maid who heard from the baker who heard from a passing merchant that when Hush reprimanded Leif for his behavior, she only did it to appease the other people present, and that Leif just smirked at her. At least she did something about it, but she is going to have to keep him in line.", "Did you hear? Miss Opal did a real good job taking care of those victims from the fire in the Severed Tail. Her initiative is commendable, what with her being new to healing and all.", "Mister Chinco went to church just to let everyone know he's capable of beating up S'allumer, and is just waiting for him to show his face. If S'allumer brought on a fight, I have a feeling it would be more along the lines of wiping someone out of existence rather than playing swords. Going into a holy building to talk trash is just unacceptable behavior, no matter how ridiculous the statement mister Chinco made was.", "Chinco, Chinco, Chinco. He encouraged people to attend mass by telling them to get in the damn church, and then made comments implying holy areas should be desecrated. If that wasn't enough disrespect, he stuck around for all of Mistress Meepers' prayer service, being generally disruptive and rude.", "Mister Ramsford was helpful in organizing and advertising Mistress Meepers' prayer service, and politely reminded people to attend on her behalf. What a good go-to boy he is.", "Mistress Meepers took time out of her busy schedule and trekked all the way to the Newtown arena to inform the Bisclavret nobles and a few others that she was holding a prayer service for the people who were victims of, and fought against, the fire in the Severed Tail. Being thoughtful really can take you places.", "Sir Bayard risked his health as a Noble to save the Severed Tail and its guests during a recent fire. He was badly injured during the process, but continued with extinguishing efforts regardless. Now that's behavior representative of a Knight.", "Sir Bayard bravely fought the fire in the Inn, sustaining burn injuries from his efforts. Acting selflessly really has got him a lot of recognition lately.", "When Meepers organized a prayer meeting for victims and fighters of the recent fire, mister Ramsford went out of his way to go around town announcing the event, and even put up a public notice for her. Sharing information is a great way to get recognized.", "Mistress Meepers took initiative and organized a prayer meeting for those injured in the fire. I'm sure the church folk will agree it was very pious of her to do so.", "Did you know Meepers organized a prayer meeting? If you didn't, where have you been?! She went to a lot of trouble to personally invite people and have it be a noteworthy event to thank those who fought the fire in the Severed Tail, and those who suffered from it.", "Meepers is being recognized all over for her recent prayer session honoring those who fought the Inn's fire, and sending warm wishes to the injured. I just don't even know how much more I can say about it, to be honest.", "Mister Teros and mister Ice were spotted kissing each other in the Docktown park area, and they're both men! How utterly inappropriate for a public place.", "Doctor Hush might have allowed Leif to cozy up to her in the commons at first, but she swiftly realized it was making people uncomfortable, and followingly told Leif to stop engaging in such inappropriate behavior. Time and place is everything; I'm glad she came to see that, too.", "I heard mister Leif was expressing bodily affection to Doctor Hush in the commons. Even if they're courting, that's just unacceptable behavior in a public area. He needs to think about how his actions reflect upon her too.", "That Kildarien fellow is really thoughtful! Why, I heard he took a full meal to Veritas, who was very busy all day. At this rate, he is going to put a lot of wives out of work!", "You know, brides-to-be can go really nuts. I hear Dahlia was in tears about the wedding preparations, so Brie offered to take them over. Which Dahlia agreed to, but then two days before the wedding Dahlia started making her own plans, and ignoring the work Brie had done. I tell you, those brides, they be crazy! Best to just avoid them entirely until the day of the wedding.", "I thought Baronet Althalus supported the Constabulary? Maybe not. He recently questioned Sheriff Joshua when getting arrested, demanding to see documentation on the arrest procedure. That's not the best way to get brownie points.", "Seems Sheriff Joshua has been getting a little rough recently while arresting Nobility. Baronet Althalus claims he was treated like a common ruffian by the Sheriff, despite the assurance that he wouldn't present any problems to the Constabulary officer. I guess the Baronet was hoping to go cuff free and get some special treatment due to his rank.", "Miss Prudence has been acting like a whore again in public, and followingly gets aggressive when people make a verbal note of her behavior. If you don't want people to see you for what you are, then perhaps some different behavior is appropriate when in crowds.", "That miss Danae sure is doing a good job of taking initiative and organizing the citizen's militia. I bet the number of complaints about available Constabulary members dwindles with the extra hands around to help out.", "Bayard is doing his part in supporting the Constabulary by joining the citizen's militia, so that any actions he takes to defend his House are legal. I heard he was incredly patient in exercising his newfound power when arresting mister Chinco, too.", "Despite having had multiple opportunies, mister Bayard still hasn't acknowledged mister Veritas' help in carrying him to the infirmary following his heart attack. Whether or not you get along with someone, it's generally polite to thank them when they have aided in saving your life, especially when you have previously gone out of your way to damage said person's reputation and standing and they helped regardless.", "Scandalous! Miss Dahlia was seen entering her private room alone with a man who wasn't her husband, and she didn't even acknowledge the Nobility she passed by while in this other man's company. Hasn't she only been married like a day?", "I heard miss Brie arranged for the Rinaldi to rent out the College in Newtown for miss Dahlia's wedding reception, and a day before the wedding Dahlia informed her that she had found some place else to hold the festivities, putting miss Brie in a very bad spot with the Rinaldi. I can't imagine being so inconsiderate to a guild mate.", "That slave Sigfried is really good about asking people if they need anything when he's around. Just the other day he went and grabbed a multitude of beers at the request of some people in the commons and promptly and properly handed them out. Uncomplaining and eager to serve, that's the kind of slave everyone wants.", "Mister Jace sent the slave Sigfried on an errand to get beer for everyone in the commons, and then let the slave have one too as a reward. That's the way to make slaves feel useful and appreciated.", "Despite being an owned slave, Sigfried is very helpful and obedient to anyone above his station. He'll serve drinks or do anything that doesn't go against the rules of his master, and is ever kind, polite, and proper without questioning people about the tasks given to him.", "Mister Bayard risked life and limb alongside the commoners when putting out the fire in the Severed Tail, even aiding so much as to take serious injury. Despite this, he refused treatment until all other wounded were tended to. His fortitude and dedication should be an example to all following an officer's path.", "How valorous it was of mister Bayard to charge at the fire in the Severed Tail with no regard for his own safety.", "That miss Prudence certainly has some audacity. I hear she threw wine in Mistress Pru's face when the carpenter tried to escort her from the wedding reception she wasn't invited to.", "Miss Prudence decided to waltz in on a wedding reception and be rude to the guests, and even ruder to the bride and groom! Who is going to teach this girl some manners?", "People are still boggling over miss Prudence having thrown wine in mistress Pru's face. I bet the pretty Pruessus was just livid!", "When the groom of a wedding asks you to leave a reception you weren't initially invited to, you should go. Apparently miss Prudence is unaware of the discourtesy she showed by refusing to leave mister Dune's wedding party when he requested it.", "Showing up uninvited to a party is rude. Refusing to leave a party when asked is even worse than rude, and being mean and hateful is just not appropriate regardless of where you are. Miss Prudence managed to do all these things in one day without even blinking.", "Miss Prudence showed up at miss Dahlia and mister Dune's wedding reception uninvited. When asked to leave, she refused and continued to partake in refreshments that were meant for the guests stating that the park wasn't owned by the couple and their party occupying it. Why would you try to ruin someone's wedding day, honestly?", "Mistress Meepers helpfully assisted miss Danae with an investigation into the possible arson attack on the Severed Tail. I hear she gave a list of witnesses, and a variety of leads for the Constabulary member to pursue. Cooperating with the law is a sure way to get recognized in this city; the Mistress has the right idea.", "Miss Danae has been busy investigating and diligently pursuing whomever potentially set the fire in the Severed Tail. People are commending her for her efforts.", "After Doctor Hush chided mister Leif for licking her ear in public, she turned around and started licking his jaw in the commons! Gah .. don't these people learn anything?", "Doctor Jahren did a fantastic job of tending to the injured after the Severed Tail fire. Mister Bayard even commented he would make him his personal physician if he wasn't so valuable an asset to the city as a whole. Ahh, to have good medical care is invaluable.", "Mister Bayard got harmed attempting to fight a fire in the Severed Tail. If putting himself in harm's way to protect others isn't a virtue worth commending, I don't know what is.", "Esquire Aysun is a pillar of fashion, always being nicely dressed with an orderly appearance, and displaying appropriate manners  to match.", "I hear mister Veritas gifted Countess Aedina with a unique harp recently, and distracted her from being upset over incidents regarding her house. Buying the favor of a Noble with material goods, ahh, the sweetness of it.", "Did you hear? Esquire Aysun went into a private room... with a chaperone. It shouldn't be amazing, but so few people take a chaperone with them when they are going to be in private with a member of the opposite sex. Remember, You and Me and Chaperone makes Three.", "I hear that Miss Xena is willing to chaperone when people of rank will be in private together. She's certainly got the social respect to be a good chaperone.", "I heard from my friend's cousin who heard from her husband who works as a butler with the Bisclavret that Lord Twyrch hates doing paperwork, and Esquire Aysun picks up the slack. I still don't reckon nobles work nearly as hard as us commoners. How can they when they spend all their time gossiping instead of working. Speaking of which, that reminds me about this story I have to tell... you'll never believe what the Rinaldi chambermaid told the chimney sweep...", "Have you seen the new furniture that Esquire Aysun has been given? A gift for Lord Twyrch to recognize her hard work.", "Is Yeoman Veritas now working for the Avoirdupois? I hear he's been going into private rooms with their slave.", "Need a dummy to beat on? Kildarien will gladly volunteer his own body for spars if you have students to teach combat techniques to.", "That Esquire Katrina sure is a S'allumer loyalist. Apparently she wants the Inquisition to be more forceful, and to make public examples of those who spurn the Light. I bet Presbyter Ximen is just giddy with that encouragement .. frightening!", "Having a party, but don't want to clean up the mess afterward? Hire on mister Fyros. I hear even if you leave goods of value behind he'll return them without a second thought.", "Despite all of Esquire Aysun's duties, she still sets aside time to pray on Dimache like a good follower of S'allumer should. It's no wonder the Light has showered her with so many blessings.", "That carpenter squirrel, Irene? Shes been giving a lot of gracious discounts lately to people on furnishings so they can spruce up their homes. A whole room for twenty denarii? Psh. Sign me up.", "The Rinaldi's newly inducted miss Lianaar has agreed to serve as a mediator between the Doloreaux and Constabulary. She has been gentle and understanding with the Doloreaux embassy and is giving them sound advice on how to kiss and make up with the law guild. That's the sort of person every house should be looking to employ.", "Esquire Katrina hasn't given up on soothing bad feelings between the Doloreaux and the Constabulary. She's being proactive and cooperative with the Rinaldi trying to clear out the air on behalf of her embassy.", "Mister Rhys has embraced the spirit of giving, turning over a new violin to the University for it's music students.", "Miss Shade isn't very discrete about her entertaining of men. She was hanging all over Caelith in the commons the other day and then stepped out into the boarding house lounge where he passed through a few moments later and led her toward the guest hall. It doesn't take a genius to fit the pieces together.", "That miss Minni is ridiculously bold in her promiscuous propositioning of men. They have a cathouse for people interested in that kind of work, don't they? Someone needs to give her directions.", "Esquire Katrina sure does promise a lot of things: contracts regarding meteors, courtesy lectures and church sermons. Have you noticed she rarely follows through on those promises? Yah, even her courtesy sessions only lasted for a few bouts, and that doesn't even require organization with anyone but herself. Gentry people should know better than to make promises they cannot keep since their word is worth more than the word of many.", "Mister Grimclaw always acts with discipline and professionalism when carrying out his duties as Veritas' Lieutenant. If you need a soldierly sort, maybe you can see if he can be hired out?", "Miss Taraji proved she can follow orders from her commanding officers and act with discipline during one of the Sentinel's recent contracts. Despite that she lacks extensive formal training as a soldier, she still gives 100%.", "However rough around the edges some might call Mister Rhys, he is quite the gentleman. Whether asked or not, he'll happily escort women of breeding throughout the cities and alleys and ensure them safely to their intended destination. What a good Yeoman he's turning out to be.", "Nyx is good at testing blah blah blahs.", "Sergeant Danae has been actively working to set up the citizen's militia. Her hard work definitely deserves some recognition.", "Azrael is good at testing blah blah blahs too!", "If you're going to be a criminal, at least don't be a pest. Mister Chinco recently wasted the Constabulary's time after being arrested by walking slowly, generally stalling, and being irritating. If you're gonna do the crime, be prepared to walk swiftly to your fate. The lawpeople don't like stragglers.", "Mister Mac is doing his civic duty and has joined the citizen's militia. What a good choice for a house guard to make.", "Mister Cullan has decided to join the citizen's militia on behalf of the Bisclavret Embassy. What a good guy, doing his civic duty.", "Miss Taraji apparently gave her jewelry to a parrot named Belle. Even though it was an act of somewhat unwilling kindness, she could have reacted far worse to it. She did a good job of maintaining her composure while the bird snatched her things.", "Miss Lianaar offered to mediate between Sheriff Joshua and Baronet Althalus with their current disagreement, appearing impartial and listening and understanding concerns on both sides. I hear she's a woman very conscious of propriety too, rising when her superiors do, and waiting to sit until they sit. What an asset she is to the city, aiding in such capacities.", "Mister Rhys comported himself professionally and controlled his soldiers well during an outing to parley with Seaweed Joe. Others in attendance were appreciative of his leadership abilities.", "Lord Marucs sure is an understanding Noble. He listened to Baronet Althalus' concerns regarding the Sheriff and attempted to assist in finding a resolution for everyone without impuning on anybody's honor. Tact and delicacy are fantastic traits in a leader, and are definitely useful tools in diplomacy.", "Did you hear? Ryan has been helping Doctor Hush's new students by proffering himself as a patient to be practiced on. People are even saying he got his finger dislocated for the sake of education. Wow, what a dedicated and obedient person he's turned into since serfdom.", "Did you notice Ryan gets a little jealous when his master, Doctor Hush, gives attention to soemone else? To retaliate he tries to act fond of different people too, but unfortunately he forgets to think about whether they might get into trouble or not.", "Even after being warned about mister Ice and his aggressive attempts to kiss other men, mister Zev was seen going into a private room with him. I guess warnings don't mean anything to some people, or maybe he just isn't worried about Ice's romantic inclinations. It isn't terribly inappropriate for people of the same gender to be in rooms together, but his judgement is still questionable.", "Not only did Virendra cheat on his wife after swearing to be faithful this time, but when his wife found out and left him, he went and found the lass he slept with and beat her half to death for sleeping with a married man. It's a shame we dont have a place for the crazies in Triskellian..", "Meepers sure is unorganized. One of her customers came complaining that she crammed all their new clothing into a package without separating one outfit from another, leaving them with what looked like a colorful load of laundry.", "Mister Styre and miss Elizabeth have been seen entering private rooms together, and both have declined the offer of a chaperone. Now what could two people being doing alone in a room that they don't want others witnessing? Think, think, think.", "Ryan has been engaging in random acts of kindness, giving some of his own clothes to a recent newcomer in Triskellian.", "Boy, that Ryan! He was generous enough to give a newcomer some brand new clothes. Doctor Hush sure must be a good master, raising her slave to act so nicely.", "How many times do people need to be chided for fighting in public areas? Mister Virendra caused a scuffle in the infirmary, and refused to leave until after the guards gave him a good kick in the behind.", "How rude! Mister Ice was heard saying he wants to slaughter miss Prudence. Even if you feel that way, you shouldn't talk about it in public. Slaughter isn't a polite word.", "Mister Ekalah saw some fighting in the commons and as a way to show disapproval refused to make a dagger for one of the people involved in the scuffle. I guess at least they still have their fists to hurt each other with.", "Talk about adding insult to injury. After miss Madalina beat up miss Prudence in a fight, she followingly struck her across the face! Women sure can be brutal..", "Baronet Althalus is back to insulting the Sheriff. It's a good thing there are people like Sir Brooks around to be supportive of the law while still being polite and honorable, or people might wonder if any of the Houses understand the importance of a law.", "Despite being continuously insulted by Baronet Althalus, Sheriff Joshua has continued to handle interactions with the Doloreaux noble in an honorable and polite fashion.", "Looks like Mistress Meepers is siding with Sheriff Joshua against the Baronet Althalus. I hear she politely parted company from a scene where the Baronet was being rude because she couldn't suffer sitting by while the Doloreaux Noble flung commands and insults at the Constabulary leader. What a true Rinaldi.", "Even if you're a Noble, you don't really have the right to insult other Nobles. Baronet Althalus has gone back on the warpath against the Constabulary, telling Sheriff Joshua to shut his mouth or take his leave if he doesn't have anything useful to contribute to conversations. Way to set an example for his house, eh? And think of that poor Katrina who has worked so hard trying to smooth things over from the last incident.", "Insulting the Sheriff in front of others? Too bad for Baronet Althalus people aren't comprehending his issues with the law anymore, nor are they appreciating his commanding a fellow Noble to leave the room or shut his mouth. He might think the world revolves around him, but if he continues being rude and nasty he's headed for a wake up call.", "The Sheriff politely dealt with Baronet Althalus despite the Doloreaux Noble being very rude to him, telling him to shut his mouth or take his leave. He even bowed and stuff after being so insulted! I would have given that boar the what for, I tell you, but I guess that's why I'm a humble gossiper.", "Sir Brooks sided with Sheriff Joshua, and left a meeting after Baronet Althalus once again insulted the Constabulary member. They say there is power in numbers; how many people are on the side of the Doloreaux?", "Mistress Meepers supported Sheriff Joshua by leaving a meeting after Baronet Althalus again insulted the Constabulary. It's nice to see the Rinaldi keeping its loyalty to local law enforcers.", "For shame! Telling the Shriff to shut his mouth or leave a meeting. That's exactly what Baronet Althalus did, to a Knight no less. How can Nobles expect commoners to respect them when they can't even respect each other?", "Despite Sir Erwin knowing that Sir Brooks is a Noble, and confirming his knowledge of it, he didn't rise to bow to the Avoirdupois Knight when he entered a meeting, and never addressed him properly during the course of said meeting either. It's rude for Nobles to not acknowledge one another, especially if one of them is showing due respect.", "Miss Prudence fought with a pregnant woman in the middle of the commons. Not only did she fight with someone in that condition, but she lost! How embarrassing for her..", "Miss Prudence was brawling with miss Madalina in the middle of the commons with a full group of people around no less! How unsafe, and isn't that Madalina pregnant? I wonder what the condition of her baby is with all this fighting going on.", "Miss Madalina was brawling with miss Prudence in the middle of the commons with a full group of people around no less! How unsafe, and isn't that Madalina pregnant? I wonder what the condition of her baby is with all this fighting going on.", "While her husband did cheat on her, and she is pregnant, miss Madalina took it to a whole new level making a public spectacle out of the occurrence. If my significant other cheated on me, I surely wouldn't want everyone and their uncle knowing. How embarrassing.", "Mister Virendra has once again cheated on his pregnant wife, and was even obvious enough to get caught and let news of it seep out to the public. Why did he ever get married at all if he can't respect his vows?", "Did you know mister Virendra is actually still available? That's what the scroll his mistress sent to his wife said. Yep, and that's why she gave him good lovings. You'd think people would notice that pregnant woman he's married to at some point, but maybe he's with so many different women nobody really knows who he's actually taken vows to.", "The Doloreaux aren't very happy about Sheriff Joshua doing his duty and handcuffing Baronet Althalus in public. I think they would have preferred more discretion, but the law treats criminals the same regardless of rank. I bet it would have been handled more politely if there wasn't so much friction going on between the Doloreaux and the Constabulary right now. Jeesh, I'm glad I'm not a part of either of those organizations.", "Lady Theressa was said to be in the commons speaking only in her native Eastern tongue and looking amused when the commoners had no idea what she was asking. Maybe she assumes the language is the default tongue of everyone? I don't know, but it's pretty disrespectful to the culture of others, and really strange that she seemed offended when nobody responded to her questions.", "Sir Erwin was kind enough to act as Lady Theressa's translator to ease conversation with the common folk of the city. Apparently she has forgotten to speak Calabrese during her time away.", "Things are all good between Doctor Hush and the Doloreaux now. I hear she's even aiding them in speaking their case amongst the guilds and assisting in convicting the street rat Rankin for his crimes.", "That Taraji sure is a respectable and loyal employee. She not only turned down the promise of more pay to work for miss Prudence as bouncer at the Maison, but went and told her employer of the offer so no rumors would start that weren't already explained. Smart idea, especially considering how nasty rumors surrounding the Maison can be.", "Miss Prudence is trying to snatch away employees of guilds now, falsely promising them more pay to be bouncers in the Maison. Just when you think she can't stoop any lower, there it is.", "Even though people didn't get to make it to her actual wedding, Mistress Pru and her groom were more than willing to invite everyone to the reception and share good food, drinks, and entertainment.", "Even though people didn't get to make it to his actual wedding, mister cullan and his bride were more than willing to invite everyone to the reception and share good food, drinks, and entertainment.", "Miss Prudence was in the commons the other day, I'm told, making vulgar comments about miss Lidia being scantily clad. After the insult, she even punched miss Lidia in the face! A brawling prostitute .. just what the city needs.", "I hear miss Lidia was in the commons the other day wearing practically nothing. Prudence plucked at Lidia's camisole and called her a vulgar name, at which point Lidia slapped Prudence in the face and mentioned something about her being 'diseased'. It's no wonder miss Prudence is constantly picking fights! These people rise to the occasion, I tell you.", "Despite mistress Meepers still having to fight against unfair biases due to her past, she is doing her beset to quell rumors by being honest and understanding, and has gone back to praying in the chapel for those who speak ill against her and her friends. That's proof that anyone and everyone can find strength in the Light. Good for her.", "That fox with the yellow rose in her hair? That's Tatiana. I hear she was looking distraught and Virendra asked if she was alright, you know, out of the goodness of his heart, and she just responded with drastic accusations .. none of which could be true, naturally. Sure is rude to judge someone you don't know, even if you know them by listening to the rumors.", "If you plan on going out shark hunting, make sure to drag Meepers with you. I hear she can prepare shark skin like it ain't nobody's business.", "Insulting a man and calling him criminal scum without knowing what he's done or if he has a history of being bad is just rude. That's what miss Tatiana did, and hey .. wait a tick. Ain't she new to town? You'd think she'd be wanting to make good impressions by showing that she has some manners.", "Who's a cute little wolf cub? Lennox is! That little'un is also so polite and respectful, saying please and thank you even when he doesn't need or have to. The Sheriff has schooled him right in manners.", "Lia sure does get involved in a lot of things that aren't her business, but have you seen her get involved in things that are her business? Not many people have. Cleaning the trash, for example, or other slave chores she's supposed to attend to. Maybe she's too good for the work befitting her station.", "Miss Iolanthe has started showing an interest in understanding local etiquette and courtesy expectations by attending some of the Docktown courtesy lectures. It's so great to see commoners working to better themselves!", "I hear miss Prudence called one of Clover's workers a whore. Doing that is like saying he hires whores! He may run gambling dens, he may do loans at usurious rates, but he definitely doesn't dabble in whores except as a rare customer. Them're the facts.", "Mister Rhys is currently supporting people who want to further their education by helping pay for schooling for those can't afford it, and by donating instruments for those inclined toward music. I'd be suspicious of someone so nice if it were me, but it ain't, so carry on.", "Bob told Sally who told Joe who told Esther who told someone else I can't remember the name of that Doctor Hush has been going into private rooms unchaperoned with mister Leif. Even if they are courting, playing in each other's bedrooms isn't courteous behavior.", "That Veritas is always holding chairs and doors for ladies, gentlewomen, and even female commoners. Some of these Knights around town need to take lessons from him, seriously.", "I hear that the slave Lia gives out free salves and herbal products to whores without asking for any kind of reimbursement. The employees of the Maison just think she's great for doing that. I'm not so sure how the gardeners feel though about losing out on coin.", "Miss Taraji has been vigilantly guarding the infirmary for Doctor Hush while a patient is in recovery. It's good to have someone capable loitering outside the door in case anyone tries to sneak in and assault anyone again.", "I heard Madalina went and hurt Minni in the infirmary while Minni was recovering from the beating Virendra had given to her earlier. Oh .. you don't know that story? Madalina is Virendra's pregnant wife, Minni slept with Virendra, Virendra sleeps with both of them, and both Virendra and his pregnant wife went to assault Minni since she is obviously the one causing issues. Yeah, I can't hardly keep up either.", "Sleeping around behind your wife's back might be somewhat acceptable to some people, but beating up on your mistress after your wife finds out you're cheating? If Virendra can't take the wrath of his wife, it might be a hint to stop sleeping around instead of encouragement to beat on defenseless women.", "Not only does miss Minni sleep around, but now she's sleeping around with married men like mister Virendra. What a homewrecker.", "Esquire Katrina may be decent at dealing with other Houses, but she can't seem to keep her own embassy members from acting inappropriately in public. As acting Ambassador and a supposed expert on courtesy and protocol, you'd expect her to have a stern talking to with mister Leif about his improper public displays of affection, but she hasn't. Perhaps being a stricter judge of character when it comes to who the people in her House can court would help? One thing's for sure, doing nothing in response to his activities is bringing shame to the Doloreaux.", "I heard from a sailor, who heard from a healer, who heard from someoneâ€™s wife that Hush lets Leif grab her inappropriately in public! When they were caught, they both denied anything was going on. I guess they were so wrapped up in each other, they forgot the crowd of people in the commons...", "Leif was all over Hush in the commons -again-. She should know better than to allow that, recently having been promoted to the rank of Yeoman. She doesn't even try to stop him in crowded areas, so it's no wonder he keeps doing it.", "I hear Leif is at it -again-, groping and kissing Doctor Hush in the commons. Honestly, is that what the Doloreaux consider appropriate courting procedure?", "Does anybody ever see Eldro doing anything work-wise? I don't, but someone happened to see him carrying 27 denarii around the other day. I thought slaves weren't supposed to have money as a general rule? Oh well, nobody seems to care what he does or doesn't do anyway.", "I hear Lia went and told the Sheriff about some creepy black magic business. What a brave thing to do, especially since the accused is known for being crazy!", "Disdainfully speaking about the Constabulary and how they like to 'waste their time handcuffing Nobles' is hardly a productive way for Baronet Althalus to mend his relationship with the city's law enforcers, or with the Rinaldi for that matter.", "Mistress Meepers recently injured her leg falling down the stairs in the boarding house, and Deputy Krell has been assisting her everywhere she needs to go. What a good Constable he is!", "A monkey heard from Naomi that Ryan told her she should work as a whore in the cat house. Even a serf should know better than to encourage his own daughter to be a whore!", "I hear Deputy Krell threatened to have miss Tatiana charged with insulting an officer for expressing her opinion on a bath satchel. What is the Constabulary coming to trying to make criminals out of people with fashion sense?", "Not only is he a capable Sheriff, Joshua is a sharp dresser, too, and he can perform well in his very best attire. You'd never know he only owns two pairs of boots unless I told you. Oh wait .. shoot.", "Mister Gothryd came out of the cathouse unabashedly talking to others about how relaxing the whores were. He even had the audacity to discuss the bull who had been in there before him. Even the Maison has etiquette, and disclosing who frequents it in a public forum just isn't appropriate conversation.", "I don't think mister Zander is a healer, but he took it upon himself to set Sang's nose when it got broken, even though it was spewing out blood everywhere. Talk about some atrocious volunteer work!", " Mister Jace has been giving free lessons to those who don't know how to swim. I bet the number of drownings start to decrease thanks to his generosity, or they increase, depending on how good of a teacher he is.", "Mister Rhys always honors the holy day of Dimache with several hours of prayer. Other people need to take a hint from his dedication and loyalty to religion.", "Serfdom has brought Ryan closer to religion. People are talking about how he has been spending Dimache praying in church. Thanking S'allumer for your blessings is a sure way to continue receiving them.", "Talk to S'allumer much? Ryan does, especially on Dimache. Just go to the church and you'll likely find him there honoring the Holy Day.", "Miss Taraji is following in her boss' footsteps, honoring Dimache with prayer and observation of the traditions of the Church.", "I heard Lia was giving Doctor Hush an attitude when the Doctor was trying to explain that giving away pastes and other supplies adversely affects other students, gardeners, and healers. There's a way to state your opinion without being offensive, but Lia obviously picks up her manners from her Doloreaux owners.", "How low the Doloreaux seem to have fallen lately. I was told that Esquire Katrina has been openly contributing funds to one of the many new streetwalkers in the city who is vying for renting space at the local brothel. How absolutely scandalous that a gentle woman would so freely support such an establishment.", "Doctor Hush has been writing on the public boards in favor of stepping up against black magic babies at the request of miss Cincin. It's nice to see the guilds stick together on some issues.", "I hear Mistress Meepers did a good job and helped miss Brie out with her auction due to Brie being injured. How nice that despite the two are both seamstresses they can still get along and not have everything turn into a competition.", "Miss Angeline was heard saying she wanted to see mister Sang naked after she'd only met him two minutes prior. How utterly improper, and doesn't she claim to not be a whore?", "Miss Schiacchitano is ever polite and proper when dealing with persons of rank. I hear she made a fine impression on mister Rhys, and even managed to impress Countess Aedina.", "Unsolicited, and out of sheer generosity, mister Rhys was said to have given two aureals to miss Tatiana to help her buy new clothing. He sure is sweet to the women, isn't he?", "Mister Virendra has been threatening people from behind bars! He told miss Tatiana she shouldn't chide or insult him for the crime he committed when he would be released shortly. I don't doubt him either, after what he did to miss Minni.", "Katrina is giving money to support the establishment of prostitutes in the city. That's terribly inappropriate for a woman of genteel nature, and especially one who prides herself on teaching etiquette and courtesy and supporting the ways of penitence.", "Know what you should do if a masked stranger asks to groom you? Smile and back away. Just ask Nayrienne.", "You know that Caliste? She made some food for a local event, but ended up making too much. But instead of throwing it out, she distributed it to a group of needy beggers. How thoughtful!", "That wolf seamstress, Dahlia, had a wedding not too long ago. I heard that she sent a bunch of refreshments out to her friends that weren't able to make her reception; even slices of the cake! Lucky!", "You remember that fire in the boarding house a while back? I heard from one of the Severed Tail maids that Caliste raced upstairs, heedless of the smoke and flames, to rouse people who would otherwise be burnt to a crisp! How brave!", "That Xena sure is becoming quite the diplomat! Not only did she arrange the parlay with the infamous Seaweed Joe, she also hired mercenaries to protect Lord Marcus, wrote up all the contracts, and handled all the negotiations.", "I heard Veritas accompanied the group who went to meet Seaweed Joe to protect Lord Marcus. He handled the company well and was very attentive.", "Despite being a commoner, Taraji can keep herself composed and proper among higher company. She is even good with creatures, like Seaweed Joe's parrot, whom she kept entertained during the meeting.", "You know that very quiet wolf, Grimclaw? He also attended the meeting with Captain Joe. He was very observant throughout, and lent his support to the Rinaldi, despite not being a member.", "Fyros attended the meeting with Captain Joe, despite not being offered any pay or compensation for his time, made the introductions, and stood to support the Rinaldi. Oh, and he helped keep the Captain's parrot occupied.", "Despite being in the presence of an infamous pirate, Lord Marcus handled himself responsibly and professionally at the meeting. He took care of most of the diplomat talking and assisted in arranging the parlay.", "Xena handled herself typically well during the parley, but most of all she made sure the deal struck was followed through, no matter how long it took. She has the patience of a saint.", "Xena is good about providing work for the small mercenary guards around town. She enlisted Veritas's guild, the Sentinels, to protect her and Lord Marcus during the meeting with Seaweed Joe.", "Veritas was accidentally overpaid by Lord Marcus for the work he and his guild did during the meeting with Seaweed Joe, but the guild leader promptly returned the extra amount. How honorable!", "He hosted a party for Beltane, explained what it was for, provided food and drinks, and included everyone in attendance. It was really fun.", "He provided music for Veritas's Beltane event, free of charge. It's hard to come by entertainers these days, so was good of him to come and liven up the festivities.", "He helped provide music for Veritas's Beltane event, without expecting any pay. With a shortage of good musicians in town, it was nice of him to offer his services.", "The festival of Beltane was a big success, and I heard Caliste helped prepare for it.", "The potted plants around the city sure are thriving. I saw Shade scurrying around town making sure they were pruned and watered.", "Xena chaperoned a meeting between Esquire Aysun and Lord Twyrch, and it's a good thing too, can you imagine the trouble that would stir up if anyone started any rumors between the two nobles?", "I heard Lord Twyrch crafted Esquire Aysun a literal smorgasbord of shiny new furniture for her hard work for the Embassy and for handling what no one else would. He also made sure she was being paid properly.", "She made a request of Xena to escort herself and Lord Twyrch up to the Esquire's room for a private meeting, so that no one would spread any nasty rumors. A very appropriate action.", "Esquire Katrina was kind enough to let her own courtesy lectures trail off while Xena held her own so there wouldn't be split groups. Apparently the whole thing was to see if Xena was deserving of sponsorship. How clever.", "You know that lioness, Xena? She does a real good job working for the Rinaldi. Capable of handling situations involving jewelry-crazed birds, hostile pirates and protecting her Nobles all at the same time. It's good to see a commoner represent the Rinaldi so well!", "Have you heard about Angeline? Apparently she went to the prominent seamstress, Brie, for a clothing order and introduced herself as a Mistress. When asked what kind of mistress she was, she refused to answer, then called Brie naive for practically no reason. How rude!", "You didn't hear this from me, but I think Caelith thinks his employer, Clover, is fat. He said something about Clover being exhausted, probably from climbing down his stairs. I don't want anything bad to happen to me, so I don't think Clover is fat..", "It's hard to believe that new arrivals in the city can be so respectful, engaging and polite, but that gorilla Gothryd is all three! He was also brave enough to accept monetary assistance to help him get started.", "You wouldn't believe what I saw! Cullan, who recently got married, was taking Inalla up to the guest rooms, and without an escort or anything! Scandalous!", "I saw Inalla go up into the guest rooms willingly with Cullan, a married man. And without an escort! Can you believe that? I wonder what Mistress Pru would think.", "That Prudence sure is a little tart! She was harassing Doctor Hush in the commons, right in front of everyone, calling her horrible names and accusing her of being a bad healer. And without any reason other than to be mean!", "That Prudence again.. she was even harassing Caliste just because she thought Caliste was wearing clothes too fancy for a slave. I think Prudence isn't wearing enough for being a commoner, in my opinion.", "Someone needs to whip that slave Eldro into shape. He doesn't do anything a slave is supposed to do, like cleaning the rash receptacles. I'll feel sorry for him when Faile finds out.", "I overheard that Prudence asking Veritas, in the middle of the commons no less, if he wanted to bed her! Ugh.. don't the local prostitutes have any sense of discretion?", "I don't know all the details, but I heard Madalina stormed over to the infirmary and attacked an injured woman, all because she can't control her husband. Who violates the safety of the infirmary like that?", "Caliste is so incredibly helpful to others, it makes my eyes hurt. She is always freely sharing her knowledge to anyone interested.", "Even though her own arm was mangled badly, Shade helped bandage Brie after being injured during the shark hunt. How caring!", "Did you know about Captain Fyros? He doesn't own his own ship, and instead rents them - but he does bring them back in one piece, which makes the ship owners happy.", "A fisherman and a captain, Fyros is also a waiter! At the auctions, he was fetching and carrying pie. Good to see a man who can make himself useful to his guild superior.", "The Dean of Arts? He crazy! But polite, stopping to help Brie when she was on crutches and had all that furniture to move.", "I hear Leif is saving his strength. While Brie was struggling on her crutches under all the furniture, Mr Leif pretended he didn't even see her and left her to sort things out on her own. But you just wait until Leif busts out his strength, he'll be so well rested that he'll punch right through a stone wall!", "Some tips for meeting new people. 1) Have a third person introduce you to them, if possible. Do the same for anyone you do that the stranger hasn't met. 2) Ask them thoughtful questions, like what they do for a living, or what noble house they support. 3) Avoid wrapping your tail around strangers. Even people who are courting shouldn't carry on like that in public. Asking them the thoughtful questions from step 2 while touching them just shows everyone else that you're fondling a stranger in public. Where are the constables, to file charges of disorderly conduct?", "That Brie, she's either really dedicated, or really greedy. Holding an auction, after nearly being eaten by a shark. Maybe Brie is dedicated, and the shark was greedy?", "That greedy shark, trying to eat Brie. Luckily, Meepers offered to help with the auction. Good on her.", "You don't want to be Brie's fiance. That shark attack, Mr Ramsford got hurt too. But then Brie sent him running all over town carrying packages for her auction. The poor man! Oh well, such is married life, and Mr Ramsford shows how a good husband should behave. Isn't that right, girls?", "Cursing and lecturing people about eating meat? Who does that serf think he is? And what does he expect, should wolves go on a salad diet? No no, I'm going to eat meat if I care to, and he's lucky I'm not an atavist, or I might consider some pot roasted rabbit.", "Kissy kissy kissy. I think Hush and Leif are joined at the mouth. I guess gossiping about them behind their backs wasn't enough for them to get the hint. Maybe we need to gossip louder. About HUSH and LEIF. Doing THAT THING TOGETHER... you know, KISSING. IN PUBLIC. AGAIN. Was that loud enough? Think they'll find a room next time?", "I heard Taraji was half-naked while swimming. Some people think that's bad, but I hear she isn't half bad looking. And I guess it's all fine. It's not like she was swimming naked, after all.", "I heard Opal was half-naked while swimming with Taraji. Phwoar, too bad I wasn't there. It's not like they were swimming naked, though.", "Unmarried? Flirting? Suggesting they would 'drag each other off'? Carrying her off in his arms? And on a Dimache!", "Unmarried? Flirting? Suggesting they would 'drag each other off'? Allowing herself to be carried off in his arms? And on a Dimache!", "What's this? Ximen was asked about courtship, and sent him to Xena? I know she handles courtesy lectures, but shouldn't a priest be able to give advice about the first steps leading to marriage? Isn't that one of the things priests do? Is Brother Ximen so full or fire and brimstone for the heretics that he's forgotten to guide the faithful?", "Taking an interest in politics, attending meetings, participating in contracts, and setting a good example? His superiors in the Sentinels are certainly noticing Jace's behavior!", "I've noticed Lysandus has been attending Sentinel meetings. Think he's bucking for a promotion?", "Have you heard of Lysandus? Better avoid him if you are a cat, unless you like being called kitty. But you haven't heard this from me.", "Docktown has a few rugged and crude people around. Some claim Lysandus is one of the more disrespectful types, but I never seen the man myself.", "When someone wanted to go and bath without a swimming suit, Opal ensured no such thing happens. She lent the suit for him so he can look for turtles. Smooth and proper, don't you think?", "You hear about that dog? Well, it seems his name is Lysandus and he clearly doesn't respect Nobility. He's been pretty rude in front of Dame Grazia. I wonder how the nobles and their guard will handle it.", "Cursing in the church? Loud enough for people outside to hear? Tsk, tsk. I wonder what brought Ryan to do so.", "You know what they say, if you can't handle people digging in your laundry, don't spread it in the commons, right? Maybe Madalina should stop cursing at people who explain to her why her daughter might be avoiding her.", "Zoe is a very popular and skilled carpenter. But maybe she still should answer all her scrolls and customers. Some seem to be quite upset about her lack of correspondence.", "So you have issues with manners and protocols? Veritas, I heard, is always ready to aid in the field, patiently and kindly explaining rules of courtesy.", "My my, some people just love to complain. If they don't have a satchel, that's the problem, if they have one, then that's the problem. Tatiana should have valued Deputy Krell running all around the town to get her a satchel when she complained about lacking one. Even if it didn't fit her attire. Careful what you wish for.", "Employees of Veritas claim he is one of the best employers people can have. Loyal to the people he employs, makes sure their needs are taken care of and paying fair wages. Not bad. Shouldn't all guild leaders be like this?", "Taraji's co-workers seem to be rather pleased about her helpful spirits and ability to mediate, when such need arises.", "S'allumer is the most important, right? Right! But some do not wish to learn of him! Lysandus picked whispering to a whore instead of learning of the light. Doesn't he know, S'allumer sees all?", "Bishop Basanti? She is quite actively seeking leadership when she is around. Did good with all the sermons, and the chapel was filled with followers. But I hear some feel low about her sudden leave. I hope she is all well? She didn't even have time to settle matters of the church, before she left, I heard.", "A devout follower of the light, Esquire DiDraco, or as others know her, Meepers. She is often seen in prayers on the hol.", "A devout follower of the light, Esquire DiDraco, or as others know her, Meepers. She is often seen in prayers on the holy day of Dimache.", "Not only is Ryan rumoured to have been in the possession of grain, but he has also been openly showing it to others, in a crowded bar, no less! Good think Jace and Anabella intervened.", "What a good chap that Jace is. I heard he, and some others aided to stop a slave from using grains and reported the event to the superiors so the constables can handle it.", "You know how mos people are really lazy about informing the constables of bad things? Well Taraji ain't one of those people. She has been diligent to report things to her superiors so they can inform the constables. That's important, especially if grain is involved.", "Giving out clothes to the needy, listening to their ails and giving good advice, that's what Taraji is to friends.", "A real gentleman, people say. No wonder some envy his mate, Taraji.", "Some people, not only does Inez openly admit to her questionable profession, but she also gives away names of her clients. I wonder how she expects to have any clients that can pay in the long run.", "That Hush is such a creative doctor. Using steaks to have her students practice the stitching on. Who would have thought. I hope they let a beggar eat the food after it, stitches or no stitches.", "Courting different people is one thing, but Althea openly talking about her previous mates is not something people should hear in public.", "Esquire DiDraco, also known as Meepers is valued by the church. She understands the process of power within the Church, she asks for a boon and then makes a donation to the Church within her means.", "Some watch with growing worry and envy, that Veritas Rhys' mercenary company spreads in various non martial fields. Traders, blacksmiths, all are drawn to the Sentinels. When he goes to the competition for teachers, will that backfire to anyone, I wonder.", "Ryan has truly embraced the spirit of S'Allumer, unconditionally forgiving people for their past sins and transgressions against him, he made an impressive display of what it means to be an Penitent.", "That brash horse, Clover? He is a real Docktown fellow, anyone can tell that by the crude remarks he makes while staring at women's derriere. Not something you'll see in Newtown.", "Shhh, shh, have you heard of Hush? Once upon a time she has been courting Master Ekalah, but as he left town, she had to move on. But I heard she has been causing issues about some jewelry he gifted to his new love? Women and jewels. Who can understand them.", "Jayland is so polite all the time! Always quick to help people when he can, like when when Virendra was injured, he instantly helped him to the infirmary. Courtesy not always expected in Docktown.", "Meepers was thoughtful enough to adopt a child of her own breed. She does deserve a bit of happiness.", "A package was delivered to Jace, full on money. He soon learned the money didn't belong to him, and he sent it onward to Clover. That was the proper thing to do, yet so few would have followed that behavior.", "A package was delivered to Taraji's mate, full on money. They realised the money didn't belong to him, and sent it onward to Clover. Mighty thoughtful and proper of them.", "Clover is said to be a caring guy, making people smile, when they feel all upset and down. Look how he cheered up Opal the other day.", "Hush certainly knows how to make deals. When asked she agreed to put a hold on her bidding on the auction item, she sought, so Veritas would not miss out on it. That's how you make gestures.", "What an honest girl, that Taraji is. She and Jace were having a package of coins she could put away without consequences, yet they returned it to Clover. I tell you, that's a big deal!", "What an honest man, that Jace is. He and Taraji were having a package of coins he could put away without consequences, yet they returned it to Clover. I tell you, that's a big deal!", "Even after Ryan was sold, Jahren, having the best interest of the town on mind, decided to keep training Ryan without charges, so all could benefit from their skills.", "Virendra, that wolf? You know him? What a rude guy. When Clover called him up to his room to have a private conversation where he could have got a well paid job from Dame Valara, he just kept growling to his wife in their wolf tongue, closing out both the host and the Dame from the conversation. He should know better then to insult those people. How does he expect to get paid jobs from them this way?", "You know Madalina? What a rude lass. When Clover called her up to his room to have a private conversation where she could have got a well paid job from Dame Valara, she just kept growling to her husband in their wolf tongue, closing out both the host and the Dame from the conversation. She should know better then to insult those people. How does she expect to get paid jobs from them this way?", "Wynter from the Rinaldi is a real caring and sweet woman. She takes all the unwanted clothing and changes them into fashionable, good quality items. She has golden hands when it comes to seamstressing.", "Many claim that Ryan, the slave is a slave by heart, but he can stand up for things he believes in, even if he has to oppose Clover for it. Brave move. I am curious what Sir Brooks is to say about that.", "Why does a landed person care for the eating habits of a slave? I heard Cullan went a long while to make sure Ryan stops eating vegetables.", "Sir Brumble is a prominent person, Zander noticed it and went out of his way to assist him in his daily deeds, bringing tea and helping with any matters tasked with. Impressive and smart.", "Sparring has different rules in Docktown and Newtown, but even so, Veritas should not have continued sparring Zander after seriously injuring him, nor acting callous while his sparring partner was being treated, you know.", "He might have caused dire damage to Zander while sparring and having a bit of fun about him, but he was good sports then, making sure Zander is taken care of and having hot chocolate while recovering.", "Ryan seems to act better since owned by Sir Brooks. The slave made sure that wounds of Lord Samstag is treated properly after the Lord's sparring match.", "That Guardsman Biggs really cares about the people of Triskellian! When that crazy panther Kafka attacked someone in the jail and held them hostage, Biggs was the only one who was worried about them getting hurt. All the other guards were too busy talking - one of them even told the hostage to shut up! We definitely need more guards like him, who take their jobs seriously and actually care about people.", "That Kafka is one crazy panther! He attacked someone who came by the jail and held them hostage in an attempt to get the Sheriff to let him go, can you believe it? He was already in jail, so he obviously doesn't know how to behave, but even that's taking it a bit too far.", "When found Lord Otto von Samstag in need of a healer, esquire DiDraco, also known as Meepers, hurried to his aid, the seamstressing practice must have come handy for patching up his shoulder.", "Zev stood by Lord Samstag and did his very best to protect the lord, when conflict with Jaren happened, even though he could have been gutted in the process. None can have anything against a bloke with a spine.", "Virendra was very willing to help out any stranger who is new to the city, showing them numerous places and introducing them to citizens. Making new people feel welcome is an example we should all follow.", "Hrm, Augustus? Keep the tone down. You know what I heard? He provided false testimony against a noble's personal rival to gain the noble's favor. Though who doesn't do that? No good pulling whiskers of nobles.", "Defending your house is important, but is that worth enough to lie to the constables in order to harm personal enemies of your house' nobles? Many would say yes. Especially if it comes to the Doloreaux.", "Meepers and Virendra needed some plants and didn't know what to do, but that slave? Ryan? He did his best to assist in obtaining said plant. Real helpful of him.", "It takes a lot of guts to stand up against a house, not to mention if it is the Doloreaux, you have to face. But Gnaeus did just that, to ensure the freedom of Docktown denizens. Rhea and Jarek surely appreciated his efforts.", "Some say, Hush is quick to throw her fellow commoners under the carriage if it looks like it'll get her in good with a noble. Or maybe she just happened to agree with the noble?", "An upstanding citizen, that Chesh. I was told, he defended an innocent man from false charges, despite his personal feelings.", "Kilana was willing to risk his goodstanding with the Doloreaux in order to defend the commoner's rights. Or was it more done for Rhea and Jarek? People say both things.", "Senora is loyal to her house, I heard she has testified in favor or her house in the case about Rhea and Jarek. The Doloreaux have always been a close knit house.", "Oh my, an Avoirdupois who publicly makes fun from nobles wearing tutus in private? Nan should know better to keep certain laundries behind closed doors.", "Sir Brooks has trained his former slave quite well.  The young serf has manners that reflect quite well upon his Master.  Nor could one fault him for his generous nature.", "Krell knew he can not beat Chinco, but he risked his life, as the Constabulary's interest and his own duty so demanded. People like him make the Constabulary an establishment that makes Triskellian proud.", "That Ammy lass? If you feel you need a lapwarmer, she might be the one to ask, I heard she is free to sit on men's lap in the commons. Though you might get slapped if you try. Lasses are fickle things.", "Risking his own life Chinco fought capably when the sylphs requested an excursion to the sewers to collect spider silk.", "Sable risked her own life in order to obtain the spider silk needed for the sylphs. Brave and heroic deed of her.", "Miss Noire Shirune heard someone was in need and didn't hesitate to offer her assistance in collecting spider silk, despite the obvious dangers.", "Despite only having arrived in the city a few days prior, mister Damon Case jumped at the chance to offer assistance collecting spider silk for the sylph Ileana.", "Did you see who Lancepesade Cullan was walking around with today?  Some slim buxom birman who was only wearing a chainmail bra!  He was showing her the performers in the marketplace, but his eyes were certainly not on THOSE performers...", "From his reputation you might not know it, but some claim that Valentin Forza is one of the most professional business men in Triskellian. He understands the finer points of business, including working with others and has no hesitation paying very well for goods and services.", "Doctor Jahren is very generous with his services and knowledge, offering both free of charge and only asking for donations if his clients believe his work merits it. Though some claim this causes the economy to have some imbalance. Still quite charitable of him.", "Whenever you want to find Jahren, he'll be in the infirmary, tirelessly tending to the needy and sick, no matter how cranky they are or how tired he is.", "You may not hire anyone in your guild that is not fitting into that guild perfectly. Or so mister Virendra thinks. He went to lengths to try to revoke Chesh's guild's charter just because he hired an entertainer. I wonder why he thinks a mercenary guild needs to entertainment. Hrm.", "Virendra ain't getting more friends by mimicking and taunting people, especially if they are from the Avoirdupois. Who is surprised Nan took offence?", "Did you hear about the Dean of the university? No, the woman, not the crazy one. I hear she's courting someone, but still went up to some other man's room to drink whiskey. For an awful long time. You would think someone of her station would know to take an escort. Wine and women, I wonder if there was any song?", "Hear that Clover's been inviting women up to his room, without escorts? That rascal! I bet this isn't going to help him rise in society, but from what I hear, his aspirations are much lower, so he can get away with this.", "I hear that Mr Clover is a really friendly guy. It's good advice to be friendly, when you're in his line of work, it makes certain he has lots of friends around. And he'll continue to be your best friend... until he's not. Then you'd better run away fast, because if he catches up with you, you won't be able to run on those legs anymore...", "Did you hear that Sir Bayard went slumming through the sewers to fight some spiders, or collect their silk. Don't the Avoirdupois have any guards that could have been sent instead?", "So Ryan called a guild council meeting on behalf of Faile, and represented her. But Clover wasn't happy about that. He was so unhappy that he... that... I just can't talk about it. OK, I'll try. He was so angry that he... he called Ryan names! And he's usually such a polite young man!", "Miss Zenkuro is the honest sort. Unfortunately, she is honest about her profession too. She was willing to say to anyone she is a pickpocket. Let's hope that's just a bad jest. Just make sure you tie your pouches around her.", "Not only a good, but a patient teacher, Doctor Jahren. He remains polite and encouraging during teaching how to handle a bow, never laughing about missed shots. Isn't that what we all wish for ourselves?", "What goes around, comes around. That's what they say. But why would Calista work for someone she badmouths behind his back? Doesn't make much sense for me.", "You know what they speak of Celia? She is a smart, proactive and capable business woman. She's very helpful if you need to get things for a reasonable price and in a timely manner. Good to know.", "Captain Carlon is an upstanding member of the Rinaldi. Yet, you know what they say about him? He has offered to train a member of the Avoirdupois, and free of charge even. Now if all could follow that example...", "Such a selfless fellow, Doctor Jahren. If you want to be a healer, make sure to read his book. He worked a lot to provide free knowledge for those who want to better themselves.", "What? What's wrong with people?! Didn't you know grain is illegal? Why eat it in the commons so blatantly? Maybe ask Shaira, why she did it.", "Nicki, a real friendly cat. I heard she is the one to seek if you care for free catnip. That must be why so many felines are around her.", "Running around drinking all the time is not what you want your kid to be remember you buy. But it seems that is the life Madalina is planning for her baby.", "I was trying to get some coin over at the dock, and you know what I saw? Edwardo trying to sell a bonefish for 10 denari. And when he couldn't fool the others he was telling them, they are bad merchants? Arrogance can go a long way. But not always.", "My sister was in the Commons the other day. She came home all unsettled and told me he overheard Flynn offering a woman to try him out, and the women then gladly headed off with him toward his room.  But you know little sisters, they talk a lot.", "My sister was in the Commons the other day. She came home all unsettled and told me she overheard a man offering Calista to try him out, and she then gladly headed off with him toward his room.

But is Damon to show a proper example, I ask? Coming to town claiming to be a paladin only to run off with the first woman that shows interest in him to a private room. Tisk tisk. Wait till the church hears of this.", "We all know, how Virendra is, cheating on his wife right after she left, but honestly, in the jail? Did he think the guards are blind? That place is full of constables! Some people just feel no shame!", "Zenkuro, young and beautiful? Sure. But certainly not decent. Getting intimate with a man in the jail? In front of all the constables? The jail is Constable HQ for S'allumer's sake! You can't burp one without having an elbow in your mouth.", "She made a heap of jewelry to practise or somethin' an' then just gave it all away. How generous. She even made sure it got distributed evenly between the people present.", "Grazia loves caramel apples, some say they are a quick way into her good \\r\\ngraces. ", "We thought by now Virendra learned not to pick fights in a bar, too many witnesses. But if you do, at least have the guts to admit it.", "Promising to treat a patient, people wonder why Jahren wanders off to chat with Hush instead. Who wouldn't want to know what Doctors speak of between themselves.", "It seems every time I'm hearing about someone go off talking to Zeiss, they come back a bit queasy at best. You'd think after all these years, and criminal charges, folk would learn not to be in the same room alone with him. Though only really bothers me of course when its a friend looking all perturbed.", "Randomly insulting people that aren't even around to defend themselves is a bad way to go about getting friends. Specially dangerous people.", "You know Esquire Xena? A good person to do business with. She will not accept downpayments, only after she provided the service. Lucky for the Rinaldi to have her.", "Not even greeting people before engaging them in conversation and being rude with them is not something that'll aid Zeiss in getting rid of his excommunication, is it?", "That Virendra's getting smarter! In order to accelerate the resolution of his black magic problems with the Church, he offered to aid them by lending out some of his warrioristic guild members.", "It's not only the Church spreading the word of S'allumer! Esquire Lianaar herself is committed to preserving the integrity of her faith, and hasn't had any problem speaking the word and acting to protect it. I spy a secret paladin.", "Dame or not, Katrina is ever generous in sacrificing her personal time and income to matters of import. Most recently she was caught donating to aid in the finding of a cure for the sick.", "What's up with the clergy these days? After learning black magic was performed in front of the chapel, miss Tomoe dismissed it saying she couldn't react or respond without Presbyter Ximen around.

I hear he took exquisite minutes of the guild council meeting for people who weren't in attendance.", "While most artists will agree that the physical form is beautiful and something to be admired, mister Sang has taken it to a whole new level by verbally promoting nudity in the commons. Some opinions should simply be kept private, or at least are better expressed in a private setting.", "Nobody seems to know whether Chesh is married to Kilana or not, but plenty of people know he has a fondness for kissing her in public.

Methinks someone needs to learn the rules of courtship and the boundaries for affection in public settings. And shame on her for purring!", "People are complaining that Ryan gets into their business too much, and that he's just going to get himself in trouble because of it. Maybe waiting to be invited into business first would be the best solution?", "I hear it took Sang four months to finish one item! It's too bad the bloke who told me didn't let me know whether it was worth the wait or not...", "Doctor Hush is a good friend to have. I hear she took it upon herself to gift Clover a wooden basin when she found out he was looking for one from Sang.", "If you want a good contract written up, Vajhira's the girl to contact. I hear she's even working on her temper, so she might be more pleasant to work with.", "Loyalty is a virtue that's worth recognizing, and Santiago has it in spades; just ask around.", "I heard Luciano went crazy in the commons and ended up stabbing Ammy. Chinco Jr. sure is growing up to be something ... special.", "How many times can someone threaten that they're leaving the city without ever actually doing it?

Hurry along then, and if you make it anywhere, don't forget to write!", "Take a tip boys: Giving lands as a pre-wedding gift to your bride-to-be shows trust, generosity, and an understanding of the impact of economy on a marriage.

No slapping the clowns, please!", "Virendra is a nice guy. Or is he not? Well it seems he did quite a lot of things to impress his wife. Be it name calling, rock throwing and mocking. I wonder if it was worth the effort.", "It is not the best thing for a woman to be seen entering men's chambers all on her own. Someone ought tell Bekka that.", "I saw Inquisitor Tomoe some time ago in public. Sitting on the lap of a guy clothed but in loincloth. What secrets was she prying from him?", "If you want to buthead with the church, be careful. I heard Mufasa did it right in the lounge. Bad idea, I tell ya!", "I heard Nan saw Virendra take a wolf skull, draw magical symbols on the ground, make the skull glow...and she never reported this heresy and black magic to either the church or the Constabulary! That leaves everyone in danger by staying silent and practically condoning the behaviour.", "When Doctor Jahren had issues with Flynn, he didn't just drop contract, but kept his side of the bargain and sought resolution calmly like a gentleman. And thus, the resolution was found.", "When the Avoirdupois needed aid in a dangerous assignment, for the good of all, miss Maena offered her services for way less then the danger would demand it.", "Shhh, you know what I heard? I heard Virendra permormed black magic rituals, right in the commons. Was he not scared priests come from the chapel? But then, I ain't seen the priests putting him on a stake yet, so who knows.", "Helen is said to be a very competent business woman when it comes to interguild relations and negotiations. She almost single handedly managed to preserve a lucrative business arrangement for her guild with her light touch and skilled diplomacy. That's word on the streets.", "Inquisitor Tomoe has been seen around the Maison in company. Well, woman of ill repute need to take confessions too, but why not in the chapel?", "Triskellian is the very heart of the S'allumnitan religion.

She made sure she knew exactly what she was getting and what was expected of her. That's the responsible thing to do.", "You know Polgara's brother, that big tiger Mufasa? Well, I saw him dragging poor Inquisitor Tomoe around the Commons by the arm, berating her for... *ahem* Private issues. There's something to be said about a man who airs his dirty laundry so freely. Especially if clergy is involved.", "Shaking people in the commons stating they like someone more then them is odd, even for someone like Mufasa.", "Not only did Virendra engage in fights in the commons, but he didn't have the decency to remain quiet about it. Still, writing it all up on the lounge's boards?", "Miss Helen is quite a civic person, even if people like Virendra are set to annoy her, she keeps her cool and expresses her displeasure without being insulting or emotional. If only more people knew how to do that...", "Deputy Krell is a known figure of the Constabulary. I heard he is man enough to apologise for his short comings and alter his behaviour if needed. Virendra might learn something from him.", "Some gentry have taken notice to Clover's eccentric methods of dressing and taken right to complaining... for good reason. Apparently this sizable man has an affinity for wearing female undergarments and finds no shame in sporting them, and himself, publicly. Being unique is one thing, and being inappropriate another; perhaps someone should offer to make him a robe for such adventurous occasions?", "I hear that big tiger, Khagra, he was seen often in Church when he was leading the Rhashak Clan. He sure has come a long way. Making up for past mistakes and shortcomings by trying to spread the teachings of the Light all the way back to his home lands and attending Church whenever he can. The church is always a good solution!", "Tiberius made a good start in his employ with the Constabulary. Soon after being shown how, he already got down to papers and did all the administration on his own. Initiative people are always welcome in places like that.", "Come on, Chinco, do you never learn? Attacking a constable now? You should find something other then that to entertain yourself with.", "Being bored is a state for Chinco, I heard. One that makes him grab a weapon and whack people with it. Bad bad habit. Someone should tell him to learn sewing instead. Just not me.. you there, you tell him?", "What to do if your friend gets attacked? Stand by and watch idly, I heard that's what Sinjaa did. I don't want to know how Tiberius repaid his loyalty.", "That Virendra, he might be just not as bad as people say. He is kind enough to make healer's life easier by distracting their patients from pain so they can work on them swiftly and professionally. That-a-boy.", "Chinco is determined to pull the whiskers of nobles by his continual disrespect. Guess what? He manages. I heard more and more nobles are getting quite annoyed by that man.", "People getting into conflict with Ryan always get irked.  I wonder if it is the boy or that he chooses badly in whom to get in conflict with.", "I heard, Ryan was chiding someone above his rank about their own child. Rude and also not really any of the slave's business, what you say?", "That artist, Sang? I heard he was sick as a dog and collapsed right in the commons! Hurt his head something fierce. But not to worry, his friend, what's her name? Vajhira Rhashak, that's right! Well, she took good care of him and made sure he got to a healer just in time.", "Not only is Tiberius diligent in his tasks as a constable, but he is also motivates others by his good example. I heard even Joshua caught up on his old missives seeing the deputy work.", "Ryan is certainly loyal to the Avoirdupois. I heard he has been filling in Brenner on news and the house on all things of interest.", "The Avoirdupois were always chivalrous people. People say Dame Valara is one of the best examples of them, one that understands why some topics are just not meant for anyone's ears. If only more followed her example.", "Tiberius is quite collegial, inviting others in the constabulary for drinks. But smart enough to buy non alcoholic drinks since duty can await at any corner.", "If you need a seamstress working on short notice and even take the initiative to decide on some matters about clothing, then Nan is the perfect person for you. I heard she is good with working under pressure.", "Questioning your superiors is slippery ground. You can not ignore flaws, but you can not openly question them either, unless you are a Bisclavret, I was told. And even there it has dire consequences. Still, questioning your house leader openly in the commons with the half town witnessing it is just making the challenger, the leader and the house look bad as a whole. Why did Brenner go on with it anyway?", "Sir Bayard knows how etiquette works. He asked his house's leader for permit on courting before he progressed with it.

Why would a man brag about being able to best every person in battle when only non-martial women are around? I have a few ideas...", "Public name calling might be natural for Madalina, but it is still not customary for general populations, not if they want to be more then fishers in the town.", "Whoa, that tiger lass, Nisha? She ain't afraid of showing her feelings. She was seen yelling and screaming in the commons to a masked panther. I heard she even clawed the bark of the big oak tree. Poor tree, it was entirely innocent, I swear.", "I heard Nisha does lose composure at times. What's this about yelling names at people, calling them whores? I wonder if they were actually.. right. Nice day we have, no?", "Nan is a duteous member of the Avoirdupois. But then, why is she pulling a sword in front of a noble when the noble made it painfully clear she doesn't approve of female swordfighters.", "Being arrogant is a bad thing, however calling yourself a minion is a bit uncouth. I heard Nan did it anyway.", "One should always ask a noble for permit before approaching, Krell should have done that in regards of lady Aria.", "Thukal knew how to handle matters of protocol by introducing people unfamiliar to each other.", "What a kind soul miss Bekka, I heard she was willing to walk all over town to aid a stranger with finding a place. Being helpful leads a long way.", "Fips is a great gardner, and an honest and honorable man.

UGH.", "Sir Erwin went along an expedition to clean the waters of the pirate Redbeard and his lots. The good Sir acted knightly all the way along, not forgetting his manners even on sea and took a big part in taking down the pirate captains.", "The guilds of Triskellian arranged for a fleet to wipe the haughty smear from the face of Redbeard, infamous pirate captain of the seas.

Nice to see a soldier house do some soldiering.", "That Luciano is certainly being foolish every step. First just randomly stabbing people, but then pretending he didn't have coin to pay a debt before trying to hire guards. Why did he think people will not catch up on that? Then he refused to pay a small debt in blood, however he fought to the death. That doesn't see smart to me. Might be prideful, but not smart at all.", "Cullan's politeness is certainly appreciated. Escorting back Dame Katrina to her room without being reminded, that men should do so was noted.", "You know Madalina? Mad Dog Maddy, her other name. Wanna know how she earned her name?

Declining when invited by a knight is disappointing.", "Calling out the Rinaldi Reeve in the commons because she declined a lesson in matriloquentia is hardly professional nor Knightly.

Thus no wonder he is tasked with sensitive matters such as negotiations two houses in relations of inter house marriages.", "Not only was Virendra willing to risk his life and arrange for an expedition to try to find out about the fate of Dune, but he was also willing to pay for the expedition from his own coffers.", "When Virendra was pointing out he is doing his best to learn from the fate of Dune, his wife, Dahlia, while being thankful, kept repeating she never asked Virendra to make the expedition.

That's dedication!", "Ramsford showed excellent fighting skills and teamwork during the encounter with the bandits, and did his best to ensure the safety of the people around him, even defending those he wasn't overly fond of from the beginning.

Better to risk not seeing them than setting yourself up in a failed interaction.", "Mister Kaine tried his best to help out with a criminal investigation by having suspects do some practice shooting at the archery range to gauge their skills. The Constabulary was just tickled pink by his willingness to aid them.", "*le gasp* Ery loosed her sailors tongue on a constable in the infirmary. That might sound worse than it actually was. The point is, you shouldn't curse at law enforcement.", "Miss Nan was speaking improperly to a superior about their tone of voice when she was, in fact, mistaken in thinking it was an act of unkindness.

At a recent reception, they say all she did was whine and complain. Talk about an event spoiler.", "After a first and second request from a Noble to remove her mask, Maggie was said to still refuse.

It's a good thing she did too, because nobody else from her embassy showed up.", "Hush was very polite and praised Madalina and Virendra for their work on the pirate raid voyage, even though their personal relationships weren't golden at the time.", "Good for Noe. At least one of the Avoirdupois aristocrats could get off their backsides to show up and thank the people who did the job of their embassy for them. Even if fighting pirates is too hard for the likes of Nobility, at least one might have been able to walk a few blocks and say some nice words.", "Miss Noe represented the Avoirdupois house at the reception held for those who fought against Redbeard. It was nice that she could take on the sudden job of delivering medals and handing out recognitions.", "More people sing the praises of Clover for his holding a reception to honor those who aided in fighting Redbeard.

You would think getting shot at with an arrow while your baby is in your arms would teach you to be more careful, but apparently not.", "People generally think Dahlia should have been more proactive in arranging an expedition to find her husband's remains. She was okay with pronouncing him dead and letting his body rot wherever until someone else put up the money for a group to go search for him. Even then, she didn't ensure that a competent leader was in charge, or that the group was prepared for what they might encounter.", "Dahlia went along on the expedition to find her husband's body, despite being an obvious liability due to her having no combat-related knowledge. Some people think it would have been better if she didn't attend, regardless of her personal relationship to the victim, while others think it was very appropriate for her to be present. I can see how it would work in both cases.", "It was kind hearted of Virendra to volunteer to lead an expedition to find Dune though he should have realized his lack of leadership skills and appointed someone else to lead. During the expedition, he was indecisive and only acted when pressured to by others. Then when the fighting was done, he spent more time joking around than tending to Suavis who was near death and eventually died.", "Suavis did some amazing work on the expedition to find mister Dune's remains. He even sacrificed his own life to keep everyine in fighting shape so they could ward off the bandits they stumbled upon.", "Despite the tedious nature of administrative work, Tomoe is more than willing to do what has to be done so that the church functions as it should -- even if it cuts into her free time.", "Suavis' heroic combat medic activities were indescribable! When the Dune expeidition party discovered a bandit army and engaged in combat with them, he was there, at every scratch and gash to fix up the fighters.  If you are gonna be in a battle, take Suavis with you!", "Mister Sang is apparently not only the best artist around these parts, but he's also the best teacher of music, and he charges a cheap, fair price for sharing his talents with anyone willing to learn without bias. This is a good way to encourage the growth and learning of people in the city with the expert toutelage of a Master passing down his knowledge.", "Mister Sang made the verbal assumption that one is a 'muscle-headed brute' if they hold a weapon in a dangerous part of town. In this case, the observation wasn't taken appreciatively. Perhaps more constructive criticism in the future is the way to go, hm?", "Miss Helen's recent generosity to a newcomer didn't go unnoticed. Apparently giving aureals to the passerby lands you big rewards in the gossip column, but also lighter purses.", "Miss Helen has been very supportive and patient with her betrothed's daughter and dealings involving her. She has put up with so much more than most anyone in the city would when it comes to Vajhira's attitude.", "When speaking on the topic of marriage in the commons, miss Helen verbally contemplated the impact an eloping would have on the house Rinaldi.

Perhaps they should be made more aware of the obligations incumbent upon their position?", "Miss Ery has once again offended someone by throwing rude gestures around when they attempt to help her. I guess the repetitious moral of the story is to help by not helping.", "I hear Dame Valara didn't attend the social Sir Brumble went through the trouble arranging for the nobles. A courtesy note wasn't even sent to let him know about a lack of attendance. You would expect more from Nobility.", "I hear Sir Bayard didn't attend the social Sir Brumble went through the trouble arranging for the nobles. A courtesy note wasn't even sent to let him know about a lack of attendance. You would expect more from Nobility.", "I hear Sir Brooks didn't attend the social Sir Brumble went through the trouble arranging for the nobles.

A courtesy note wasn't even sent to let him know about a lack of attendance. You would expect more from Nobility.", "Sir Brumble arranged for a social for Knights of the city, sent them invites, posted reminders on the public boards, and even arranged for cognac and thrilling topics of discussion. It's too bad nobody showed up except Lord Marcus to appreciate it.", "Miss Omen is very good abuot acknoweldging rank and understanding the importance of an aristocrat's time. That's something that will continue to gain her favor if she remains mindful.", "Ever reverent, Mistress Meepers joined Sir Edmond in an impromptu prayer for her child's well-being. She will continue to be a faithful penitent of the Light, spreading the word and love of S'allumer wherever she goes.", "Mister Chesh was a hero after the spider fight. He carried Molly all the way up to the infirmary, and waited there to make sure she didn't need anything. She sure took a beating from those spiders, and it was good that he was there to help her.", "Mister Fyros has always shown great diligence and loyalty as guard to Lady Grazia. His kindness and respect easily extends to the rest of his House as well as the general population of Triskellian.", "Mister Fyros apparently emerged as a leader during the Dune expedition. He is said to have aggressively pursued the attacking bandit leader, despite being outmatched.", "The Rinaldi continuously praise the efforts of miss Lianaar who goes outside the requirements of her position with assisting members of the Embassy in reaching their maximum potential.", "What's this? Miss Helen is being recognized for taking a stand against Chinco for the Rinaldi, even though she isn't a member of the House at all. Pretty brave if you ask me, especially considering he could probably snap her like a twig.", "Joined the Rinaldi but decided you didn't like working for a House? Just talk to mister Fyros! I hear he'll go out of his way to help place you in another career better suited to your tastes.", "I heard that in an effort to curb the poor behavior of Vajhira, Lady Aria lo Bianco appealed to Khagra to allow for an arranged marriage. A lot of punishments can come from poor actions, but it seems people favor the Lady's method of devising something more creative that would benefit her embassy while still getting her point across. Yay for smart people!", "Jaws dropped as Deputy Tremain insisted on publicly searching miss Zeera in the commons simply because he believed she was lying to him due to her past crimes. Think it would have been more appropriate for him to have taken her to the jailhouse, or somewhere a bit more private? I'm thinking so.", "Seems a newcomer to town stepped up and offered to perform an impartial search on miss Zeera for the local Deputy Tremain. Even though it didn't happen, people were impressed someone was willing to step up in an effort to uphold the law, maintain dignity, and promote peaceful resolution.", "That Fyros volunteered to go on an expedition to find mister Dune's body, and was said to protect miss Xena throughout the entire encounter from bandits. Rinaldi or not, that's bravery, and an exemplary example of a good guard.", "They say mister Virendra volunteered to act as leader of the expedition to find mister Dune's body, but that he actually had little to no leadership skills. People came back gossiping that during the encounter, he didn't have any plans on how to actually fight the bandits, and even allowed a healer to be killed! Whew, I wouldn't want that on my conscience.", "People are raving about what an amazing medic mister Suavis is. During the bandit encounter, it's said that he managed to keep the majority of people who went bandaged and capable of fighting, even though he was the only one with healing skills available. And at the end of the whole ordeal, he gave his life! What a great sacrifice, and what an example to set for other healers in the city.", "Always saying one thing and doing another? That's what they say about mister Khagra. Supposedly he vowed to shun his daughter from hsi family after some ridiculous behavior toward his House, but then recanted and decided to try to give her yet another chance to redeem herself. It's no wonder he's big on giving endless chances to his own family, but would he be so understanding to someone not related to him? The world may never know ..", "Mister Kaine is said to care a great deal about his people and the city itself. It seems recently he has been on high guard looking for Ery, who attacked poor miss Rosemarie. It sure woul be nice to have more guards like him looming about.", "It seems miss Hush has been bringing up personal topics in front of the gentry, and even when she is told to stop due to stepping over social boundary lines of rank, she continues to persist. There's a lesson to be learned here! Don't share your personal life with people who outrank you unless they explicity ask.", "Jahren is praised yet again for his ability to be kind even in stressful situations. It's said that after miss Rosemarie's attack, he remained steady and gentle with her, as all good healers should. Ahhh, it's good to know there are medics who can be trusted to be consistent.", "Miss Tomoe was being raved about the other day for bandaging people for free even though she had obligations elsewhere. Healing before business, I say! Unless healing is your business, and then it goes hand-in-hand, doesn't it?", "People seem to be pleased with Guardsman Biggs who was dutiful in performing a retrieval of a body from the bay, putting himself in harm's way for the honor and dignity of a murder victim. Honorable members of the Constabulary are always a welcome and relieving sight to the city!", "Despite being injured, mister Kaine assisted a Guardsman in retrieving miss Hush's body from the bay. Way to go out of the line of duty to do something good!", "The Guardsman is the talk of the town still for doing his best in trying to find Hush's killer against very difficult odds. They say he's been giving it his all, even going so far as to jump into the bay of Auvrich to fish for her body. Talk about dedication!", "People's tongues are wagging talking about miss Demeter who was apparently very rude recently, interrupting conversations even though she was pointedly asked to wait before speaking. It's always better to be polite and patient than to have some beggar on the side of the road tattling on you for your transgressions.", "Gemma's giving advice for life again! She was overhead saying that if you have nothing nice to say, then not to say nothing at all. This was in response to someone being less than kind to her, so I say way for her to be the bigger person!", "There's a new storyteller in town, politely asking public loiterers if they want to hear his words before regailing them with tales. It's a nice change from the violent tendencies of Docktown, and people are noticing!", "Miss Helen has been working on murder investigations and cooperating with the Constables. They're all very impressed with her inclination to go beyond the call of a citizen of the city, and why shouldn't they be?", "The commons was gossiping about Aluine and Bekka openly arguing about Aluine 'sleeping around'. People should know by listening to me regularly that you need to take those kind of discussions to private places rather than having such conversations in public.", "People are all aflutter over the Dean of the University killing Madalina on the docks. Even if she came back from the dead not fully healed in the head, you can't get away with murder and not suffer the consequences.", "While I think it's pretty funny, other people aren't too happy about Santiago punching Leoric in the face right in the middle of the commons. If you want to greet a drinking buddy, that ain't the way to do it.", "Mister Silvanus was seen waving his gun around in the commons and trying to drag off miss Rhea despite being told only Constables have the authority to arrest people. You'd think a gentryman would know better than to behave like a wild man, but apparently he doesn't. Maybe a change of scenery is in order?", "Oy! Silvanus pulled his weapon on Rhea in the commons claiming she was a wanted criminal, but took the act further in becoming a vigilante and dragging her tail to the jailhouse. He didn't even lower his pistol when two members of his own House, and a member of the Bisclavret guard stood between him and Rhea, and continued to refuse to listen to reason. Talk about inappropriate behavior from a member of the gentry! I bet his House is just mortified.", "Wtinesses are verbally commending miss Helen for putting her life at risk by stepping between Gentleman Silvanus' gun and miss Rhea. It's a bit on the crazy side if you ask me, but you aren't asking me, so who cares? Anyway, others seem to think it impressive she can keep her cool even when people are acting irrationally.", "Put in favor for the wrong person.", "Despite being a convicted criminal, miss Rhea wasn't lashing out when Silvanus was yelling in her face and provoking her to do more. She turned to upstanding citizens to confirm what she had to say through words of logic rather than use of a rapier. Is reformation possible? We'd like to think so!", "Everyone is stepping in front of Silvanus' guns these days! Add mister Carlon to the list, who positioned himself before miss Rhea when the Esquire was acting out of control. He reasoned with his housemate to the best of his ability and eventually brought about a suitable outcome despite insult to himself and his House.", "So Silvanus is now a constable.  No really.  He tried to arrest Rhea in the commons.  For serious.  Oh wait, he's not a deputy? Then why was he waving his pistol and making a big show of arresting her, even though he can't!  He even threatened to shoot Carlon and Helen if they wouldn't get out of the way, despite their attempts to talk him out of getting himself arrested.  What is this world coming to?", "During the whole debacle with Silvanus and Rhea, it is said that miss Helen stalwartly stood at her housemate Carlon's side putting herself in harm's way in an attempt to dissuade Silvanus from shooting Rhea and getting himself arrested.  Now that takes some courage!", "More and more people come to tell me the tale of Silvanus, and they remain aghast to hear that one of the Rinaldi's own gentry would pull a gun, act vigilante, and even try to shoot through his own House members if he had to to arrest someone he didn't have any right to arrest.", "Old news, but still news regardless. Gentleman Silvanus .. yes, you guessed it .. tried to arrest Rhea despite not having the authority to do so, even going so far as to draw his gun on her. I'd act more surprised, but I've been telling these stories all day long.", "Even though Silvanus is said to have apologized for wrongfully trying to arrest miss Rhea, he reportedly continued to call the Constabulary incompetent afterward. I'm guessing they weren't inclined to believe his apology was sincere. I'm guessing I probably wouldn't have believed him either.", "Gentleman Silvanus is on a rant about Rhea being a pirate, but hasn't managed to gain a scrap of evidence. Even after Lord Marcus asked him to stop doing it, he continued to argue the point that he was right, disrespecting his own Noble and disobeying a superior's order. I see bad things coming in Silvanus' future from this whole fiasco ..", "Mister Zev is somebody's hero! I hear he came to Deputy Oushi's side while trying to apprehend miss Rhea and mister Jarek, and even got wounded while doing so. You know what they say - women like scars.", "Docktowners are complaining that miss Sapphire engaged in a public brawl in the center of the commons with mister Chinco and miss Vajhira. Apparently fighting in the slummier part of town is unexpected. Who knew?", "*tisk tisk* Seems Hadrien was caught engaging in a public brawl in the center of the commons with mister Chinco and miss Vajhira. Just how many people were invited to this party anyway?!", "Good to have that Biggs fellow around. He single-handedly took control and diffused a brawl in the commons, bringing all the wounded to the infirmary for treatment before investigating the crimes. Now -that's- how a competent lawman handles things.", "Some people whisper that the rumors about mister Hadrien aren't true. People witnessed him being removed from the brawl in the commons by Guardsman Biggs because he was bleeding, kneeling, weaponless, and not fighting upon his arrival. Poor guy ..", "Hadrian is actually a hero! He came to miss Sapphire's defense in a time of great need when she was outright assaulted by Chinco. Unfortunately, miss Vajhira set upon him, and he took a good licking for it.", "Seems Chinco is still .. Chinco. He aided Vajhira in an assault against Hadrian and miss Sapphire out of sheer boredom. That guy really needs to get a new hobby.", "Miss Opal took to diligently seeing to the wounds of those involved in a brawl in the commons. Sometimes I wonder if they'd keep brawling if there weren't good healers handy to always save them.", "I hear mister Sang was trying to persuade miss Vajhira and mister Chinco to spar somewhere besides the commons, and even urged onlookers to find a Constable for the brawl that took place. It might have been nicer had he gone and looked for a Constable himself, but, hey, small things count.", "Want free hat-making lessons? Go find Carolyn! I hear she'll help people out of the kindness of her heart.", "I hear miss Helen pays her bills quickly and in full. If you want a good customer, maybe you should look her up? Debt free is the way to be!", "Miss Xena is a tactical genius, or so I'm told. Between her and Mister Fyros, they rallied the troops and took down the bandit leader.", "Stealing corpses can be good - Xena retrieved the body of her fellow Rinaldi after the bandit incident. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about... don't you?", "Scandalous! I hear that miss Sunta snatched a folder out of someone's pouch and then went through their correspondence and teased them in the middle of the commons. That's definitely not appropriate behavior for a Rinaldi squire!", "They say even if you prattle off rude remarks to Doctor Hush, she's very understanding, a good listener, and always willing to accept an apology. How very gracious of her! It's nice to know that not everyone will punch you square in the face for being obnoxious.", "People have taken flirting back out of the bedroom and into the streets. I hear that miss Madalina was allowing mister Donovan to snuffle her hair and fondle her tail in the middle of the commons. I realize it's Docktown, but some things just are best kept private.", "People have taken flirting back out of the bedroom and into the streets. I hear that mister Donovan was snuffling miss Madalina's hair and fondling her tail in the middle of the commons. It's said he even proceeded to whine as she made it a point to tease him with her body. Really, take it to a private place!", "The Bisclavret are angrily ranting about mister Cullan being a traitorous ingrate, going behind the back of his house to seek employment with Lady Grazia without even asking the permission first. All those years of protection, land, money, and martial training, and that's the sort of treatment he gives to his embassy?! I bet he risks a lot more than just a dishonorable discharge, turning his back like that on the Bisclavret. Lesson: Don't take oaths and then act against them, or, if you're going to, at least don't get caught!", "Zev is good to have around, always retrieving corpses of someone or another and reporting crimes to the Constabulary. This time it seems it was one of his fellow housemates who needed toting to the Cathedral, and he promptly had a case opened to try to find out who had harmed them.", "Rumors speculate that mister Greeves gave a woman a cursed armband to make her fall in love with him and do inappropriate things against her will. Hard to say whether or not it's actually true, but an interesting story anyway.", "Reportedly, the Avoirdupois are quite disappointed in miss Nan, who made it a point to say she wished to return and be part of House activities, but then never showed up to a House meeting after expressing she would be there. Reliability is important as a servant! Better to say you aren't sure that you can make it than say that you can and never show.", "I hear miss Opal went to miss Hush for some training on how to handle plants, and instead of Hush encouraging Opal to try harder at gardening, she told her instead that she had no talent and should take up medic training. That's not a very good method of teaching if you ask me.", "I heard that miss Una has sloughed off on her studies, including religion, and that even though her ignorance of church practices might be considered unforgivable by some since she's the daughter of a Knight, mister Bernard offered anyway to help further her education, and even appeared to be understanding that her own father, Sir Brumble, hadn't seen to it already.", "Even though miss Nan has been otherwise occupied, it seems she has taken time while in the company of others to give several lessons to other seamstresses, going so far as to share tips and helpful advice. Crafters supporting crafters, as it should be.", "Detestable! Squire Cullan of the Bisclavret was heard leading a conversation on cannibalism in public. What an offensive subject, and to go as far as discussing the actual consumption of people and the possibility of using their skins for leather? Better keep an eye on this one ..", "Surprisingly, mister Bernard was heard having a conversation with Squire Cullan in public about eating people. Conversations about cannibalism are quite offensive to most people, and likely best kept private.", "Once again, Chinco was caught drawing his sword in the commons for no reason whatsoever, this time against Zev. Doesn't it ever get boring?!?!", "Miss Lidia is said to be handling Paladin Damon's too-public interest veryw ell, maintaining a polite distance. Compared to previous actions, that's certainly a step in the right direction, and one for which she should be commended.", "Mister Kaine is always ready to defend the defenseless, of ten preferring to use words instead of sword when conflicts arise, which isn't the norm for Docktowners. Gotta give credit where credit is due!", "Mister Chinco drew his weapon in the commons yet again, attempting to attack a rather crass mouthed zebra who was being particularly abrasive.  While I can understand him being upset, there is no reason to endanger others by causing violence in the commons.", "Citizens are appalled at the utter disregard that miss Tomoe has shown her betters. She apparently took charge of the church and suddenly felt that she could speak poorly of Nobility in public. She even went so far as to threaten to use her 'Church powers' to have rank taken away from a member of the Bisclavret. Is this really the sort of person we want representing our city's religion? I think not.", "I don't care what you say about mister Virendra, if you leave your bagpipes laying around, he's sure to return them undamaged. That's more than can be said for some people.", "Deputy Oushi deserves some recognition for all the good work she has been doing for the Constabulary in the absence of her superiors. They say shes really stuck with it through all the negativity, and that's certainly commendable.", "Seems like Lord Samstag needs to go back to etiquette school. I heard he stayed seated when Lord Marcus stood to leave after one of their discussions, rather than rising and bowing as is proper of Nobility. And you all think meetings between Nobles are casual. Hah!", "Chinco has reportedly been carrying weapons despite being banned from doing so, and was even caught causing a ruckus in the commons with miss Ashai. Surprising? No, not really. No, not at all. Still, ignoring bans isn't something to be ignored.", "People are singing the praises of miss Shade saying what a wonderful gardener she is. The story goes that the daisy patch outside the blacksmith building was dying, and after it was brought in to be kept warm, miss Shade started taking care of it for the city. It now is thriving as if it were never on the brink of death. Glory for her green thumb!", "Inalla's housemates are all extremely proud of her for trying to do everything she can to reorganize the embassy in absence of any true leaders. She struggles with limited authoirty and does what she can to keep everyone strong. What more could be wanted in the servant of a great House?", "Handmaiden Inalla has been doing an exemplary job trying to assist the Ambassador in running the House while he is busy with other duties. Such dedication speaks very well of her character and commitment, and is something to be commended.", "Mister Luciano was heard cursing in the commons for no reason whatsoever, and then proceeded to tell people to .. well, you get the picture .. whenever they asked him to mind his language. If a beggar can't repeat it, then you know it must be bad!", "People are gossiping that miss Carolyn has been low on coin due to debt, and even though she and miss Helen have been at odds, Helen came to her rescue with a much-needed loan. Despite not having talked in weeks due to a personal disagreement, she helped, which was notably generous of her.", "Handmaiden Inalla made dozens of outfits and other clothes, scarves and such, and donated them all to the church to give to the poor to help them stay warm this winter.  Although she donated them on behalf of the entire house, it is well known she is the seamstress of the Doloreaux, so people would like to praise her for her good and generous works publicly.", "It seems miss Nan can be included in the group of those donating to the church and sharing her good fortune with those whom need it most. Praise for the generous, nothing for the stingy.", "Chinco once again resisted arrest, leading to a large fight in the commons between himself, several Constabulary members, and a small handful of fighters. You know what I think? Someone needs to take away all the apples and the peaches in the city and then -maybe- you might get through to him.", "Apparently Madalina has been siding with Chinco, most recently when he was fighting the Constabulary. She even went so far as to offer to draw her weapon against them. That's all we need is for him to gather a following of like-minded people!", "While people may not agree with the crimes mister Virendra has committed, they recognize that he has accepted the charges of heresy against him and is stepping up to receive his punishments honorably. Good people sometimes do bad things, and when they accept the consequences of their actions, they show that they're capable of getting better. Here's to hoping that he actually corrects his ill behavior and chooses a better path.", "Mister Fips is nice enough to give lessons in gardening to those who want to know how to pick flowers without hurting any of the plants. Need a bloom to give to a lovely lady? Go poke him .. I bet he'll help you find some good ones.", "They say Luciano was yelling, screaming, and threatening Doctor Hush in an attempt to get whatever it was that he wanted from her, and even worse, that he did it in the presence of Lady Georgianna of House Bisclavret. At least he could have reserved the poor behavior until Nobility was away from the area.", "If you're a healer and need another healer to consult, then I strongly suggest you seek out Doctor Hush! She's always very helpful and willing to suggest thing to try and aid in someone's recovery, even occasionally going so far as to give out droughts. Professional support is always a key to success.", "Need discounted flowers? Become a recurring customer of Mister Fips' and you'll likely get them! Either that, or let him suspect you don't have much coin so he feels bad enough to lower his costs. Hey .. it works for other people.", "Reportedly miss Lianaar was asked to testify against mister Chinco, having been a witness to his crimes. It seems silly that a Baron would have to ask her three times before she would do it, but maybe she has been preoccupied with more important matters. Regardless, her inattention to following orders has caused a few tongues to wag.", "Mister Sattar seems to want to try and pretend that he was never demoted. He was heard insisting people call him 'Gentleman' when anyone who pays attention to rumors or the public boards knows that he was stripped of his gentry status. Talk about rude and improper!", "Seems Sir Erwin sent a scroll to Sir Brumble explaining he'd been out of town during the Knight gathering that was arranged, thus why he was absent. Reportedly, he's the first member of the chivalry to even do that much!", "Doctor Hush is never to be busy to see any patient, any time. She'll stop everything she's doing to see you, whether you're a commoner or a Noble, even if your injury is only trivial. What a fine example of selfless service to the community!", "When entering a discussion about a Noble who flaunted an affair with a commoner, Lord Adrien is reported to have made snide remarks to someone of far greater rank, even taking the side of the disgraced nobleman. Where does the man learn his manners? Harrowgate must be far wilder than anyone imagined.", "Whether Lady Anne knows you or not, she's willing to pray for you in times of need. Just ask Meepers, who had the Lady praying for her daughter, Aine, when she was sick. Aiding people through selfless acts is a marked trait of Nobility, so it's no wonder S'allumer blessed Anne with the rank she has today if these words are a true reflection of her character.", "Out of all the people who signed up to participate in miss Nan's play, mister Bernard was the only original actor to show up. That's a true display of reliability right there.", "Supposedly miss Noire attended a wedding clad in armor. People have been complaining about what a racket she made as she strolled in very late to the event. I guess if you're going to show up tardy, it's best to at least be in the proper attire.", "I hear that Esquire Meepers took it upon herself to dance through the first dance at the reception of the newlywed Rose couple. Doesn't she know that you always always wait for an invitation from the couple before stealing their spotlight?", "Lady Georgianna has been consistently having socials. People rave about what a great success they they have been and how much fun they've provided for everyone in the city. Way to get people involved and interacting!", "It's said Georgianna is a kind and gentle Lady, and a stellar example of how Nobility should carry themselves. She tries to educate the commoners in what the Nobility is doing for them, and works hard to organize much-needed regular gatherings to promote open conversation and peaceful relations between those of good standing and the ranked in the city.", "Baron Edmond is said to have spent his entire coin pouch and then some at Lady Aria's auction for the needy, without a thought or care save for his proclaimto do all he could for charity. Truly there's a Noble heart inside this Noble Baron.", "Mister Sattar was seen butting into a conversation between a Noble Lord and Lady in the cafe at a casual social gathering recently, without first politely requesting and awaiting the attention of the one he sought to speak with. That's rather obtrusive behavior for someone of no rank, and people took notice.", "Lord Adrien has been helping the Bisclavret reform and grow stronger by acting as an advisor and friend to the current Ambassador of the House, Dame Anne. How very gracious of him, considering that he only recently arrived to the city.", "I hear mister Kaine offered to watch Meepers' kitten for a few hours. What self-respecting man would volunteer to watch a child that isn't his own? Doesn't he have the man parts to say that's a job for women?", "A Noble invests in the Sailors Guild - that, at least, would be somewhat reasonable, but to actually take over the guild directly? The guild of sometimes honest (usually not) sailors, smugglers, dockside petty criminals -- the home of the basest born? It's disgraceful for a Noble to publicly and officially run such a guild, as it's such roles that differentiate common born and Noble born.", "Scandalous! A member of the clergy is said to have caught mister Virendra urinating on a potted plant inside of the church itself! You don't need to be a genius to figure out the offense in that.", "Miss Nan was recently seen cleaning up the seamstress shop's large collection of clothing for the poor. Rumor has it that it was a terrible mess, and that she's been sorting it into outfits and bags for the needier to more easily rummage through. How thoughtful and selfless of her.", "Oh no! It seems miss Fergie has stopped writing back to her customers, even after they have sent multiple inquiries about orders, and regardless of their rank. They seem to be genuinely upset about their poor treatment.", "Miss Madalina was seen sneaking up to her room with a man she'd just met after she gave him a hefty sum of money. Have to wonder what she's up to now, don't you?", "T'he Doloreaux seem to be pleased with mister Cullan, who, despite not being a part of their house, took it upon himself to escort Dame Katrina safely to her destination.", "People are saying that mister Virendra tried to kill mister Auron after he was finished mutilating the corpse of miss Servita. Truly, this man's evil knows no bounds!", "When it was suggested by Baron Edmond that Master Ekalah perhaps join the Avoirdupois, he showed great loyalty and dedication to the Bisclavret, politely declining, but thanking for the offer. Wouldn't it be nice if all house servants acted similarly?", "Whlie Bekka is much-loved, people are starting to complain about her constantly sleeping in the commons. Not only is it inappropriate, but it's distracting to those out and about attempting to do business.", "Sang was asked to sing a song in the tavern, and automatically took to blurting out something involving bastards and incest. The people in attendance, though usually unoffended by even sailor ditties, took offense to his random selection and continue to talk about how inapprorpiate the wording was.", "I didn't know miss Bekka could heal, but apparently she can! She was quite helpful in recently assisting mister Kaine with some of his injuriese. So, if you can't find a proper medic or Doctor, you know who to turn to.", "Mister Kafka was overheard offering to teach someone else pickpocket in the commons. Doesn't he know that criminal professions are meant to be practiced and learned in secret? Jeesh.", "Lots of complaints against mister Auron recently, I almost don't know where to begin! For starters, they say that he begged miss Bekka for tons of teacher resources, and then after receiving some training, he guild quit without any forewarning, conversation, or plan and renegged on his contract. Aside from that, he was said to be presumptuous and rude to Lady Aria and reportedly almost blinded mister Joey in a practice duel. On multiple occasions when given the opprotunity to learn safety procedures, he showed callousness for the well-being of others, declining or disregarding the need for safety altogether. And now they say he's in the Rinaldi .. my, but I wonder if they know what they have on their hands.", "Did you hear that Xena was attacked?  Yeah!  Fyros went out and found the attacker, dispatching her in the process!  Ensuring the safety of other Rinaldi and protecting the general population is commendable!", "Did you hear? It sounds like Brenner and Xena patched up their differences after she was attacked! Brenner conducted himself honorably, helping to hunt down her assailant, taking care of the attacker's mangled corpse, and even standing guard outside the infirmary. Man. That's a good guy.", "When Xena was attacked in the commons, Noire was the first to react to her call for help!  If my wife is to be believed, the paladin dragged Xena from the commons and sought out a constable.  How utterly deserving of our praise!", "When Xena was the victim of assault, Aria visited her bedside to guarantee she was safe and well-protected.  When the Lady was told she shouldn't be in the area where the actual bloodshed occurred, she replied, 'A member of my House has been attacked .. where else in the world should I be?\\"  She's truly a loving and caring woman, a stellar example of nobility.", "Doing your job is something you're paid to do.  But Auron goes the extra league with his wit, charm, and general affability.  Especially when it comes to Xena and making her feel comfortable after she has been stabbed a few times.  Good chap that.", "People are starting to clamor about Presbyter Ximen not following the example of St. Helloise at all and only winning converts to the Light by instilling fear. Perhaps practicing some love, sacrifice, and charity would benefit him.", "Miss Lia stepped up and put another person before herself, making sure to heal Virendra and ensure his wounds were properly tended after his branding. Another example of a good healer doing a good job.", "Master Ekalah has taken to teaching a few individuals the basics of smithing, and I hear he even lets them help in the crafting of blades for his orders. How nice of him to share his knowledge with those less educated in metalworking, and to give hands-on experience also!", "Miss Bekka seems to be doing quite well with her guild and employees. Despite people thinking she wouldn't be able to successfully run an organization, she's pulled it off, and really helped out individuals who are new to town or uncertain about where exactly they belong.", "Say whatever you want about Rhea, but she helped to arrest Chinco, and that's enough to put her in a lot of peoples good books.", "Despite how he usually is, mister Kafka stepped up to the plate and assisted in arresting Chinco. The Constables seem pretty pleased with him, at least for the time being.", "I hear miss Lia did a fantastic job of patching up Reeve Xena after she was attacked by an assassin. They say the slave saw to the wounds with incredible professional and speed. If only all the healers were so polished.", "Captain Brenner guarded the infirmary to make sure Reeve Xena was safe and protected after the assassin attack on her. What a swell guy he is, looking over someone who isn't in his House and who he doesn't even seem to like.", "I hear mister Virendra helped capture Luciano after he beat up Deputy Zaria! Who says heretics can't still be heroes?", "Apparently miss Bekka pounced on Luciano's shoulders from somewhere high up and unseen, stabbing him in an effort to aid the Constabulary with his arrest. Criminals beware, there's some ferocity in that little package of a woman.", "Did you hear? Silkar performed an impressive shoulder slam against Luciano when he beat up Deputy Zaria and threatened to hold her hostage. He must have been low on catnip or something, to care about anything besides his next fix.", "Resisting arrest for a pickpocketing charge? One has to wonder how it was even worth it..", "Despite being far less skilled than Luciano, Deputy Zaria fought valiantly to bring him in when he resisted arrest. Them Constabulary members aren't the sorts to back down from a bully!", "Apparently mister Luciano has taken to stealing again, this time from miss Bekka. Don't you know that if you're gonna rummage in someones pockets, you have to be good enough to not get caught?", "Once again, Hush has spent her own money to restock stolen items from the infirmary, including pastes, salves, splints, canes, and crutches. How many other Doctors or healers in the city could or would do the same?", "Mister Virendra seems to have gained some ire for referring to the Rinaldi position of Maggiordomo as a 'slutty handmaiden'. Worse, he made it a point to share this disrespect of mister Edwardo and the Rinaldi with Lord Twyrch of the Bisclavret. A heretic judging other people, what's next?", "Apparently Physician Suavis thinks he's now an advisor to Nobility, and was recently heard criticizing Lord Twyrch for his choice in allies. Judging someone far above your own station never leads to anything good.", "I hear a man named Snortimeir barged into the cafe, squealed a rude greeting at a noble, and then proceeded to EAT a tuatara off of the floor. How disgusting and disrespectful can a person get, honestly?", "Mister Kafka was recently heard proclaiming that he could best everyone in the commons with both his hands missing, while wearing soiled pants. Likely it wouldn't have been a comment worthy only of an eye roll if Sir Bayard and Lord Adrien both hadn't been in the room. Such sorts of statements are inappropriate in the presence of Nobility.", "It might be a Doctor's job to help, but Jahren goes the extra mile. When someone was wounded to the point of being blind recently, he helped walk her upstairs, leaving the middle of a conversation to do so and abandoning the wait for his fiance. That he took the time to ensure his patients safety shows just how caring an individual he is.", "Mister Kafka has really stepped over the line lately, accusing the Avoirdupois of heresy, Lord Edmond of forging documents, and the Lords of the Bisclavret of corwardice. How does an embassy manage or choose to suffer someone with such a loose tongue?", "While mister Kafka might have a loose tongue, he was good enough to approach Captain Prideaux with Sir Twyrch, and apologize to him for the accusations against him and House Avoirdupois. Always remember it's never too late to say you're sorry!", "Despite a man being rude to Lia in the infirmary, she informed him that she took an oath to heal everyone, and went about doing her job. It's gotta be hard helping people who don't want or appreciate your aid, but it's pretty admirable to have a healer who will persist and ensure they're treated anyway.", "Mister Kafka is rumored to have been throwing around accusations that the Avoirdupois murdered a gazelle. I bet he's in some deep water with his house nobility and commanding officers for speaking out against another embassy in that fashion.", "People are raving about Lady Georgianna's sweet shop socials, saying they're full of fun for everyone. If you like tea, pie, and wheee, you should definitely look into attending.", "Rumor has it that Snortimeir literally tried to eat people. Nom nom nom? Who says cannibalism has gone out of style?", "What a courageous girl miss Rosaline is! She managed to evade being eaten by the most gigantic boar ever seen, and yet, instead of fleeing, she remained in harm's way to help tend the wounded people that defended her. Now there's a way to show your appreciation!", "People ramble that Snortimeir is a maniac with a bottomless pit of a stomach. I hear he even went so far as to try to eat other people, and in the commons in front of S'allumer and everyone no less! Call the Constables, and let's get this one under lock and key!", "Miss Lia was helpful in alerting the Bisclavret about a member of their House that had been causing some pretty serious problems; thus, helping to maintain the house's good standing in the city. I bet Sir Althalus would be proud of her thoughtfulness.", "Unbelievable! Mister Kafka asked if he could smoke in the presence of a Lady. How respectful not to assault a noble nose without first asking. There might be some hope for him yet!", "Mister Kafka seems to be more mindful as of late, even thinking to apologize when he forgot to bow to Sir Althalus. Perhaps the Bisclavret are taming him after all.", "Not only did Lord Samstag sponsor Clover LePlow for promotion, but he was prudent in making sure the lands weren't too close to the Avoirdupois border. Giving lands near his family estates was especially meaningful and will undoubtedly lead to reinforced ties. Safe to say everyone involved was well pleased with the arrangement, and his house should be proud of him.", "People gossip that mister Clover's swims and friendly attitude do well to maintain high spirits in the city. I wonder just what those swims involve that make them so enjoyable..", "Lord Adrien corrected his guardsman, Kafka, who was being lecherous towards Dame Aeryn in the commons. Yay for Nobles who know how to keep their servants in line.", "Lady Aria gave some sound advice to Maggiordomo Edwardo on how to approach a courtship with Sir Brumble's daugther, Una. She was patient and calm in pointing out his mistakes and further informed him what he needed to do to recover from his blunders. It's just like a Noble to show good leadership while discussing delicate matters.", "I hear miss Carolyn has been asking some of the local smiths for steel to gift to that heretic, Virendra. What gall she has thinking anyone would want to help him acquire anything!", "Word's getting out that Master Ekalah overcharges for the smithing items he makes. Apparently the majority of crafters agree, and all charge less for the same items than he does. It just ain't right for him to be taking advantage of people like that.", "Lia has been busy tending to her house duties, and writing scrolls to her owner, Sir Althalus, for the importation of plants. It's a good thing people can go to someone to get in touch with the Doloreaux nobility, or likely there wouldn't be any communication with them at all.", "Captain Kaine took it upon himself to help move furniture and refused to accept payment for the good deed. The Bisclavret sure do house some chivalrous individuals.", "When Luciano tried resisting arrest, mister Fyros had the mind to block off the alley so he couldn't escape. Good thinking, and way to help the Constabulary.", "A docktowner, and a boss in particular, shouldn't be out helping the Constables, especially fighting the employee of another boss. Talk about a big no-no! I hope nothing worse comes of it than these rumors.", "Mister Ilo has been very polite and helpful to newcomers, and even Lord Blackburne. I hear miss Bekka had a specific job she needed doing very badly, and he managed to hire someone into the guild capable of doing it. From watching boxes to recruiting, Ilo is on the rise!", "After Doctor Hush's call for a thief to return stolen items from the infirmary, Sir Twyrch dipped into his own pocket and time to produce a new set of cabinets for the city's use, and even arranged for a tinkerer to bring in locks to secure everything. How generous is the Nobility of Triskellian!", "Rumor has it that Fyros saved Ilo from an attacker, and has been helpful in teaching him new skills. Aww, to be the hero of a weasel.", "I hear miss Aradhyl is a natural healer. She helped others in the infirmary to heal Ilo, stepping right in and asking how she could assist without being squeamish or afraid to learn at all.", "The Nobles have been gossiping about how kind and generous Clover is, even giving a sample from an impromptu picnic to Lady Georgianna after hearing her social had gone largely unattended. Ain't it something when people look outside themselves to make some someone else's day better?", "A formerly filthy sailor, causing fights, mayhem, and havoc turning over his soul to S'allumer and his teachings? Truly an impressive change in one's lifestyle. It just goes to show that anyone can be touched by the Light if they open themselves up to it!", "Mister Kafka is still at his old ways, making scenes in public and bad-mouthing everyone with his crude talk. He really needs to shape up and get with it if he plans on keeping his job in the Bisclavret.", "Trying to eat innocent people? That's a monstrous thing, no matter who you are, or how big a stomach you have to fill! Triskellian isn't a barbaric land! People work to earn a living here to feed themselves. Really, mister Snortimeir needs to accustom himself to where he is, or go back to wherever he came from.", "Not only did Damara disrupt a conversation between another woman and a Constable, she did it only to be rude. At least if you're gonna impose, do it with a purpose!", "*tisk tisk* I hear Fyros got Deputy Zaria high on catnip and impaired her ability whilst on duty. How utterly irresponsible of him.", "Guess what? I heard Deputy Zaria was high on catnip whilst on duty in the commons. It's no wonder the Constables can't arrest people successfully half the time, what with them lounging around impaired.", "Miss Dazrene was said to have generously offered to give a girl new to town some of her clothing, despite the woman protesting that a seamstress could make her something suitable. How very charitable, though one has to wonder how well the clothes actually fit.", "Apparently mister Fyros showed open disdain for a language being spoken after it was made clear that the people involved were unable to converse otherwise. Triskellian is a melting pot of cultures, so it's no wonder that his intolerance is being met with displeasure.", "Master Ekalah generously offered to compensate miss Dazrene for a gown she gifted to a young woman who couldn't speak Calabrese. He also sought to aid the young miss in better understanding everyone around her. I bet the city would be a much more peaceful place if people behaved in a similar manner as he.", "Guess who was stumbling around dead drunk in the commons, approaching people he didn't know without permission, and announcing his affiliation with the Bisclavret? That's sad it only took you one guess. Yep, mister Kafka. It surely doesn't look well upon the House for one of their guardsmen to behave so poorly.", "I hear mister Cullan is still inviting women up to his room unchaperoned, even though he's supposedly married. Talk about shameful!", "Nobles of other Houses are commending Lady Aria for her good judgment of character in hiring miss Aradhyl. They say the Lady's companioni s respectful of Nobles, courteous and helpful, and thus does her Lady a great credit.", "Despite old age and weakening muscles, mister Dylan offered to help Leorory clear the rubble in the commons caused by the recent whirlwinds that attacked.", "More people are commending the aged mister Dylan for helping to repair the ground in the commons that was broken up by the whirlwinds. Apparently being old and still active is a great feat.", "While people were clearing the rubble in the commons from the whirlwinds, miss Aradhyl played them music, brought drinks to whet their lips, and made an attempt to clear up debris despite wearing fancy garments. What a multi-tasker that miss is!", "Deputy Zaria helped to repair the broken ground caused by the whirlwinds. Her vitality and eager willingness to aid with repairs were greatly appreciated and useful.", "Miss Aradhyl might night have been able to lift the rocks to repair the streets from the cyclone damage, but she did what she could, bringing drinks and playing music for the workers to keep their spirits up.", "People continue to commend Deputy Zaria for aiding Leorory in fixing the ground in the commons damaged by the cyclones. She is said to have worked very hard, steadily lifting heavy rock and debris.", "Did you know that Kafka doesn't like to bathe?  He stinks quite literally.  You would think a member of the Bisclavret would be held to higher expectations.  Not to mention pride in his appearance!", "Virendra is a heretic who can still do good things!  He went after Luciano after for beating up Zaria, even breaking the criminal's nose and getting him to jail!  Wonder what the church thinks about that.", "When offered trade goods worth quite a bit, Adrien refused the gift and insisted that the seller receive goods and services of equal value!  That's surprisingly honorable of him!", "That Kafka isn't afraid to tell you what other gentlemen are up to.  'Goin' ter wank one' is probably not something that needs to be announced.  Especially when hand gestures are involved.", "Donating to the poor and the church is good!  Dylan does that.  Especially if those fabrics aren't worth selling.  Now I know why the poor stay poor.", "I heard that Lennox knows how to woo a girl.  Sending flowers.  Giving escort.  That boy is a real gentleman already!", "Even after he was told that he couldn't help the Rinaldi help bandits, Virendra offered to send mercenaries and guards to help!  That's pretty swell of him wanting to contribute for no personal gain!", "Xena is such a brave and proper citizen!  She led an expedition to fight off evil bandits!", "Ilo is a dirty weasel!  Apparently he went into the sewers and then came to the commons and washed himself at the fountain in the commons!  Other people use that for other purposes, thank you!", "Xena is incredibly brave to be undertaking an expedition and risking herself to rescue a missing man.  Here courage in inspiring!  So are her hips.", "Despite being disrespectful to his social superiors and the law, Kafka can be a man and admit he's made mistakes!  Asking for forgiveness is a good thing.", "Brie takes time out of her busy schedule of... whatever it is she does around town to make sure he customers are extra satisfied!  If only I received that kind of service at the Maison!", "Aradhyl can be a little trickster.  She tried to trick Xena into going to a social with Fyros at the request of her Lady, then acting like a child when Xena disagreed!  Just who does she think she is?", "Healer and .. seamstress? Apparently so! Miss Lia was recently said to have helped in outfitting one of the Bisclavret guard out of the kindness of her heart. Truly, such a talented slave should be appreciated.", "Lady lo Bianco is said to have gifted out one of the most splendid gowns recently to Lady Georgianna in an effort to thank her for her efforts in throwing the Sweet Shop socials. Her kindness hasn't gone unnoticed, nor her own effort to promote Rinaldi fashion.", "Lady Georgianna has been most proactive lately in attempting to hold socials and events to engender interest in the embassies within the City. She's a great example of how Nobles should engage with others inclusively.", "Lord Adrien was most generous in donating troops to the Rinaldi bandit expedition. He set a very good example of how a guest should behave by committing his own men to retrieve an individual not even of his own Household. The respect he has shown to the Rinaldi is something to be acknowledged, and his generosity commended.", "The Baron most thoughtfully gifted a rapier to Lady Aria before the bandit expedition to ensure she had some method of protection should she need it. Not only did he have one custom made, but he had enough forethought to do it in Rinaldi colors. What a generous and fashionable man!", "Paladin Noire and Guardmsna Kafka were said to having an argument in the commons, when mister Claton took it upon himself to get involved and punch the Guardsman! While it might not be right to shout at a representative of the Church in that manner, it's also not right to get violent in public or stick your nose into business that doesn't conern you.", "Miss Lia took it upon herself to console Master Zeiss over the death of his wife, Temperance. That she would be so caring and considerate, slave or not, is commendable.", "The commoners are clamoring over miss Aradhyl, who seems to think that the working class aren't worth being polite to despite them having an obvious place in the city and society. It's important to remember that just because you work for a Lady doesn't mean that she can protect you from everything, least of all gossip.", "Do you know that miss Nan? I hear she has become a paragon of middle class values, and that her clothing craftsmanship is always excellent. She has recently been displaying a much better understanding of propriety, and has been helpful in organizing things for and with the Rinaldi's Lady Aria.", "Talk about surprising! I heard miss Aradhyl was chatting with others recently about being in a harem, and was overheard by people who thought it less than honorable considering her position.", "Miss Aradhyl was said to have accused Fyros of stealing her money pouch as he sat next to her in the middle of the commons. She didn't even stop to think that nobody else had witnessed the removal of the object, nor did she ask. Wrongful accusations can make for sticky situations, indeed.", "Did you hear? Captain Carlon was said to have had a spat with Reeve Xena in the commons over house things, and they were speaking as if they had just broken up. If that wasn't embarrassing enough, for some reason loin rubbing was mentioned. Just what exactly is going on in the Rinaldi these days?", "Captain Carlon was overheard making a lewd joke in the middle of the commons. In response to one man telling another man 'he's fast', the Captain replied that 'That's what the Ladies of the Maison tell me'. Funny or not, it's definitely not something to say in front of another House's noble.", "With very little regard for the reputations of people involved, Fyros persists upon insisting that he knows the truth about Captain Carlon and miss Dazrene's rumored relationship, despite the fact that he has been told otherwise.", "I heard miss Dazrene falsley accused Fyros of lying and spreading rumors about an imagined relationship between the Captain Carlon and herself, losing her temper near explosively in the commons and dragging Fyros off to yell at himi about some disagreement she was having with the what Reeve Xena may or may not have known. Seems someone is of the opinion that she attacks the wrong targets with her anger, one-sidedly refuses to hear any information about a situation other than her own, and rejects that she might not know everything.", "I hear mister Geradan complained about the plan to deal with the bandits the entire length of the expedition. Isn't that something you usually do beforehand?", "Bantering is one thing, but Kafka was witnessed talking to a lass in the commons, asking for a kiss while saying he tasted like candy and indicated his groin. This is another perfect example of what not to do in public, and how not to be if you've any inclination of climbing the social ladder.", "Master Ekalah recently took time to do a rush order for Doctor Hush, managing to make excellent quality shields that she desperately needed. He didn't complain once, nor did he charge anything extra for the hurry. Maybe those rumors about him being overpriced and selfish aren't true at all ..", "Geradan waited until the last minute to worry about the bandit expedition strategy, and then when he was told about it he stated he was only there to put the pointies in the bandits anyway. If you have nothing to do with a strategy in the first place, and then have no intention of following a strategy anyway, then why ask about it at all?", "I heard during the bandit expedition that mister Cullan butted into a conversation between Geradan and Reeve Xena that had nothing to do with him. After he interjected he apparently didn't know the answers to the questions being asked anyway, so it was merely pointless rudeness. He really should learn to keep his comments to himself unless someone is speaking to him.", "Those who went on the bandit expedition are cheering mister Ramsford for his preparedness. Apparently he anticipated the needs of others, and gave out blankets and food to those who failed to bring warmth and sustenance along.", "More people speak about how mister Ramsford mingled with all those present during the bandit expedition, and took to mothering everyone by handing out provisions to those who forgot bits and pieces, including blankets and pillows.", "Woo .. I heard Geradan rudely told Captain Carlon and Captain Brenner to shut up during the bandit expedition, instead of asking them simply to be respectful so people nearby could pray. There's a right way to do things and a wrong way.", "I guess Geradan took it upon himself to repeatedly interrupt the war council as they were finalizing the plans for the attack on the bandits. Many of the people present weren't too appreciative of all the noise and rudeness.", "Lieutenant Sunta is being praised for taking time away from her troops during the bandit expedition to make sure Lady Aria was properly schooled with pointers on how to use her rapier for the battle. It's never too late to get an education!", "Paladin Noire took time to say a prayer before the bandit attack, despite Geradan causing a ruckus with unnecessary comments. It's a good thing the Church has someone capable of representing them in a positive light.", "I hear Lady Aria gave quite the motivational speech on the bandit expedition in an effort to bolster the spirits of the troops. There's nothing like a good string of words to get the blood flowing!", "Sir Bayard is being commended for his ability to stay on top of his men during the bandit expedition, who were undoubtedly some of the most well-disciplined in attendance and most prepared for battle.", "Captain Carlon did an excellent job of guiding and directing the Rinaldi troops during the bandit expedition. They seemed to be kept in order and were constantly listening to his commands.", "More gossip about Geradan and the bandit expedition! I'm told he made quite the scene when people attempted to set up a barricade, even challenging Kafka to a duel. Talk about the least inappropriate time to do something of that nature, really.", "When the men on the bandit expedition started acting stupidly and began arguing amongst themselves, Sir Bayard is said to have utilized his Lieutenants swiftly to quell the problem, much to everyone's relief.", "It was acknowledged during the bandit expedition that when given orders from other House's Nobles, Lieutenant Sunta continued to act swiftly and without argument, just as any good soldier should.", "I'm told Doctor Hush did a brilliant job of handling the healers on the bandit expedition, setting up camp in preparation of the onslaught, and healing injured friends and others throughout the chaotic event.", "I'm told Lia did a wonderful job of healing others during the bandit expedition, despite being seriously wounded herself. On top of that, she was the only who could manage to calm Geradan whenever he started causing a ruckus, which is a job in and of itself.", "Miss Bekka took to healing during the bandit expedition, patching up the assassin squad led by Fyros after the battle. I hear she turned out to be a surprisingly good fighter, as well, assisting them to be victorious over the enemy.", "During the bandit expedition, miss Bekka was said to have taken a lickin', but kept on tickin'. She got knocked down quite a few times by the enemy, but continued to get up and press onward, even to the point of saving her companions in the process.", "People are swooning over the keen eyes of Ramsford. During the bandit expedition, his perceptiveness is said to have led to the deaths of several disciplined mercenaries who attempted a surprise attack in the woods on Fyros' team of assassins.", "Guess Clover has taken to using foul and irreverant language in the presence of women again, and in a public place, no less. He was said to have been talking about S'allumers balls, and no doubt it had nothing to do with games of any sort.", "Doctor Hush managed to display some very impressive healing skills and even treated people for poison on the spot during the bandit expedition.", "Miss Lia managed to display some very impressive healing skills during the bandit expedition, despite being seriously wounded herself. Hooray for selflessness and determination!", "During the bandit expedition, it's said that mister Ramsford saved Bekka from certain death, and even managed to do it with a dramatic flair. With or without style, putting yourself in harms way for someone else is admirable.", "Captain Brenner fought valiantly during the bandit expedition and assisted Captain Carlon when he became injured during the brawl. He watched the backs of everyone involved in the skirmish, whether he liked them or not. Now that's just good soldiering.", "Say what you want about Lady Aria, but the fact of the matter is she stood bravely beside her troops, despite her rank and lack of training in combat. Her fearlessness is something to be admired.", "Captain Carlon was truly a sight to behold on the bandit expedition. I hear he fought like a crazed beast, and took horrible injuries but refused to give up until he saw the Reeve to safety!", "Captain Carlon acted selflessly, putting his life on the line to defend Reeve Xena against bandits.", "Lieutenant Sunta put her life on the line and fought valiantly during the bandit expedition. It's said that she followed orders promptly and managed to even see to the safety of her Noble, Lady Aria, and the others in attendance.", "Captain Brenner acted selflessly, putting his life on the line to defend Reeve Xena against bandits.", "Sir Bayard brought his troops on the bandit expedition to help rescue a Rinaldi scoutsman, personally assisted in eliminating the bandit thread, and held a commanding attitude throughout which helped give direction to everyone involved in the skirmish.", "Sir Bayard took it upon himself to see to Lady Aria after the bandit bandit battle was concluding and ensured she had a pleasant place to rest and that her wounds were tended to. Nevermind that the pleasant place was in his arms..", "Mister Kafka made a valiant effort to get Lady Aria free from a snare trap during the bandit expedition, risking his own safety to do so. While the Lady didn't completely escape harm, many are convinced that he prevented her from suffering more serious injuries.", "Fyros, with the aid of Bekka and Ramsford, seemed to pull off a successful attempt at flushing out the bandits recently, despite suffering an ambush in the woods. He seems to be a pretty handy fellow to have around.", "Bekka, with the aid of Fyros and Ramsford, seemed to pull off a successful attempt at flushing out the bandits recently, despite suffering an ambush in the woods. She seems to be a good sort of person to have around.", "Ramsford, with the aid of Fyros and Bekka, seemed to pull off a successful attempt at flushing out the bandits recently, despite suffering an ambush in the woods. He seems to be a good sort of person to have around.", "While Bekka might have done a lot of good things during the bandit expedition, I heard she also disobeyed orders and ran about a dangerous area rigged with traps. Consequently, a spike trap got set off that injured many people. It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt!", "During the entirety of the negotiation and bandit conflict, Captain Prideaux kept a level head and listened to the orders he was given. Yay for not stirring the pot.", "Captain Kaine supported Captain Carlon's every word while they dealt with the bandit envoy recently. He knew these hooligans weren't to be trifled with. Isn't that the kind of man everyone wants at their side? A pragmatic one?", "Sir Bayard is certainly a brilliant military mind. Left with the command of the builk of the Houses military forces, he conducted himself admirably. The villains were routed and the casualties were minimal, making the expedition a success on the whole.", "Deft and able, Fyros came charging to the rescue when it seemed the tide was turning against Reeve Xena, and Captains Brenner, Kaine, and Carlon. His quick action may very well have saved all of their lives.", "Deft and able, Bekka came charging to the rescue when it seemed the tide was turning against Reeve Xena, and Captains Brenner, Kaine, and Carlon. Her quick action may very well have saved all of their lives.", "Deft and able, Ramsford came charging to the rescue when it seemed the tide was turning against Reeve Xena, and Captains Brenner, Kaine, and Carlon. His quick action may very well have saved all of their lives.", "Captain Kaine lent his services as Captain to join Reeve Xena in the negotiation process against the bandits. It was a very admirable thing to do.", "Faithful Lieutenant that she is, Sunta conducted herself well in the grueling battle with the bandit forces, despite sustained injuries from cowardly archers in the woods.", "Doctor Hush worked diligently to ensure wounded soldiers were able and fit for battle, despite injuries she herself suffered during the bandit expedition. One can only marvel at her skills, as it's said she even had time in between her healing to light a purple votive candle for Lady Aria.", "Miss Lia worked diligently to ensure wounded soldiers were able and fit to battle during the bandit expedition, despite having taken injuries herself.", "During the bandit battle, Hush was one of the many fine healers providing medical care to the warriors. Through her efforts, people were able to carry on fighting to protect Lady Aria and Reeve Xena.", "Captain Kaine killed many bandits, even engaging the enemy bandit boss and coming out unscathed. That panther is a credit to his House's famous reputation of being deadly on the battlefield.", "Paladin Noire saw to the emotional well-being of the survivors of the bandit fight through prayer and her peaceful presence. This was after she slew many foes, of course.", "For leading the bandit plot and being ever patient with all the players and scenes. Well done!", "Captain Carlon did a good job of leading the Rinaldi during the bandit expedition. He remained ever calm and collected during the chaos.", "Captain Kaine did a good job of leading the Bisclavret during the bandit expedition. He remained ever calm and collected during the chaos.", "Say what you will about Captain Brenner, but on the battlefield he refused to leave a hurt Captain Carlon behind, despite being told to go repeatedly.", "Seems Fyros managed to do a gentlemanly thing and gave Dazrene a discrete heads-up about Captain Carlon's condition after the bandit expedition.", "Some Nobles and commoners agree that Lady Aria was a needless and distracting risk during the bandit expedition. Protecting her was said to draw three or more of the best fighters available from the main battle, and she drew the attention of more than just one healer at any given time. People gossip that the Lady just had no reason to be there, and that she risked the lives of hundreds of men by her presence, not to mention risking her own Reeve and many other men simply for the sake of rescuing a single commoner.", "What a gal that Lia is! I hear she told Geradan to protect Lady Aria during the bandit attack, rather than following and protecting her. What selflessness and sensibility! She sure suffered for it too, getting stabbed, poisoned, and sliced, all while trying to heal other soldiers. Who knows what would have happened if Geradan had abandoned Lady Aria with Mama Borgia Mia heading straight for her?", "Doctor Hush made sure everyone else got looked at first after the bandit expedition before allowing herself to be tended. If that isn't dedication to the job, then I dunno what is.", "Lia was right behind Doctor Hush, making sure everyone else was fixed up after the bandit expedition before bothering with herself. She certainly should be commended by her owner.", "Kafka's repeated attempts to pick a fight with Geradan during the bandit expedition was distracting to those trying to watch for danger, and he made it a point to ignore several attempts by his superiors to get him to stop. Really, there's a time and place for such things.", "While he is indeed trying hard to curve his bad habits, there was no excuse for Geradan's bad behavior toward his superiors at the bandit site. I hear he demanded that Sir Bayard stop talking and even told Lady Aria to mind her own business. Someone still needs to learn his place.", "That Captain Prideaux is the very picture of a gallant Avoirdupois squire! Not only did he risk his life to protect the Rinaldi Reeve and rescue the hostage, sustaining multiple injuries in the process, but he took on dozens of bandits to get Captain Carlon to safety also!", "No wonder Captain Kaine is being named Lord Blackburne's squire! Not only was he involved in planning tactics and strategy for the bandit expedition, but he bravely risked his life to rescue the hostage and protect the Rinaldi Reeve. I hear quite a number of bandits met their end at his hands ...", "Not only is Paladin Noire a pillar of faith and leadership, leading the entire expedition in prayer for the success of the mission, but she also risked her life to save Baron Marcus - twice! Further, she intervened in quite a few arguments between the fighters, managing to break things up peaceably. She should be commended for her efforts.", "Lieutenant Sunta sure is an amazing fighter! Not only dids he organize the building of a defensive barricade around the ally camp, but she continually risked her life to protect the Lady Aria, sustaining multiple injuries in the process.", "That mister Ramsford! Not only did he bring all manner of provisions to support the fighters, he also risked his life as part of the rescue squad to retrieve the Rinaldi Reeve and the hostage! It almost makes up for him foolishly triggering that trap and wounding the already-injured fighters after the battle was over.", "The church ought to be proud of Paladin Khagra. I hear nobody defeated more bandits than he did. Why, he was practically a one-man army, defeating any and all foes who attempted to harm hiim or his allies. Methinks someone deserves a medal, both for risking themself, and for being so good at combat!", "I'm sure all those who went on the bandit expedition were glad Doctor Rose was with them. First she organized the temporary infirmary in the midst of the camp, and then repeatedly risked her life to heal the injured and protect Lady Aria! If it weren't for her, a lot more soldiers would likely have died from poison or blood loss. She ought to be commended.", "I hear that if it weren't for Fyros and the ambush he led, the Reeve Xena and that hostage would have never made it out alive! His team killed one of the bandit leaders, and wounded and killed dozens of other bandits! Someone definitely proved their worth in battle, and should be rewarded for it.", "That Captain Carlon! Seriously wounded in the line of duty, and yet he still managed to take on dozens of bandits before he was felled! Someone deserves a medal!", "Despite Doctor Hush not feeling well herself, she is still taking the time to follow up with and ensure that everyone from the bandit expedition is recovering and getting proper treatment.", "That mister Martin sure does seem to have a keen mind. I hear he informed a newcomer on why Triskellian is a trade center for the land of Calabria, and continued to display a firm understanding of the purpose of the city, and the relationship between the Houses. If only everyone was so willing to educate new arrivals in the more important aspects of city life!", "Sir Bayard reportedly protected Doctor Hush on her way to healing the injured during the bandit attack. His strength and martial abilities ensured the survival of many allies!", "While Kafka is known to be grouchy, he took it upon himself to argue with Geradan due to stress during the bandit expedition. He was asked multiple times to stop arguing and literally had to be threatened before he would stop fighting with his own allies.", "Cavalier Bayard may be good in battle, but he's reportedly poor at running a Household. He's apparently cracking the whip in regards to house trading, and taken his entire Household to task over what they import, and how they spend their coin, calling the rich wines and the lush fabrics that are so symbolic of the Avoirdupois 'frivolous'. Rumor has it he even took action to try and discipline a Baron of higher standing!", "I hear Lady Aria took to quarreling with Chatelaine Nan in the west commons about social and house ranks, rather than taking the issue somewhere more private and having a calm discussion. Such displays are inappropriate for a Noble.", "How rude! When Lady Aria suggested that a memorial service be held for those who died in the bandit battle, Sir Althalus took it upon himself to write the Lady for permission to host it himself. When she told him that she had already spoken to a Paladin about doing just that and invited him to join the planning, he decided to simply make a public announcement about the one he was hosting himself. Does he have such a need to socially climb that he attempts to usurp already planned events just so that he might have credit?", "Brie made sure that her husband, Ramsford, was prepared for the bandit adventure by providing blankets, pillow, food, and comfortable clothing.  Just like a wife is supposed to.", "Xena doesn't have any problems arguing in the commons with Carlon, acting like they had just broken up and talking about loin rubbing...", "Ramsford likes to mingle when he's out on the road, making sure everyone enjoys the comforts of home!", "Sunta doesn't mind giving fencing pointers to nobles on their first military venture.  It's never too late to get an education in combat with her around.", "Geradan doesn't like to take orders, I hear.  When a group went to find bandits, he complained the entire time about not knowing the plan or giving backtalk to those how had authority over him.  Thank goodness he went along.", "Bayard respectably commanded his troops through the journey to the bandit site and actively engaged in hashing out strategy and plan details with other expedition leaders.", "Fyros managed to seem confident in his portion of the strategy to find bandits, kept his troops updated and informed on their responsibilities, how things should play out, and so on.  He showed really good leadership!", "Despite not being part of a Great House, Bekka volunteered to come on the bandit expedition and was more than willing to fight for the cause, joining a group of assassins.  Grr grr, get the bandits.", "Despite not being part of a Great House, Bekka volunteered to come on the bandit expedition and was more than willing to fight for the cause, joining a group of assassins.", "Aria gave a good, encouraging speech to motivate and uplift the troops fighting to save a Rinaldi man.  It was quite befitting for someone of the nobility to take command and do so.", "Handling the situation with aplomb, Aria kept control of the troops, even though she must be quite nervous about her task.", "Of the three Captains that escorted Xena on her mission, Brenner was the only one to actually listen to and obey her orders.", "Ramsford guarded Xena while she was dragging the hostage from the bandit camp!  He protected her the entire way with little concern for his own well-being.", "Fyros managed to bring reinforcements in the nick of time, burning the bandit camp to aid the Captains and Xena in their retrieval of the hostage Espio.  Now if only I could find a pyromaniac with that kind of dedication.", "Bayard really put himself on the line to save a Rinaldi scout from the bandits!", "Xena was diplomatic and calm during the entire bandit ordeal.  When the fight broke out?  She was determined to save the hostage and work swiftly to cut his bonds!", "After Aria was wounded fighting bandits, Bayard was her blanket.  He cradled her against his chest, ensuring she was warm and felt safe, and was protected.  So chivalrous of him!", "Xena really put herself at risk, offering to be kidnapped by bandits and managing to pull it off without the death of herself or anyone of importance.", "Sunta took a great many injuries during the bandit expedition and ensured the safety of Lady Aria throughout.  What a trooper.", "Xena is modest to a fault when receiving accolades, even if they are in regard to a military victory she was the architect of!", "Xena saw to the comfort and health of all the combatants after the bandit battle.  Awww.  Thoughtful much?", "Hush tended to Xena and anybody else who was injured by bandits.  With care and skill no less.  The fact that she came along when she was clearly against the entire plan was admirable in and of itself.  That's how you get ahead, shut up and keep your head down!", "You know what Auron did?  He strolled right up to Xena after she got back from fighting bandits and asked how his sword was coming along!  Oh sure, he was willing to wait for the work to be done.  But he didn't even bother to say hello, how are you, nothing.  What a pud.", "Sunta Hare with legs up to her hair.", "Lia's a helpful sort of slave.  She doesn't mind taking the time to explain House standards, propriety, the basics of clothing, and even offers to help teach people how to speak Calabrese.  And all this for people who aren't associated with her owner's House!  How great!", "You know what Cullan is good at?  Butting his way into conversations.  During a military expedition no less!  He likes to talk about how he knows what the strategies are, especially when he doesn't know the strategies.  Never you mind shouting to drown out his superiors.", "Kafka is usually pretty insufferable.  Ask anyone.  Even his friends hate him.  But on the bandit expedition, he fought bravely and represented his House well.  Kudos!", "Care packages!  Brie made care packages for the troops going to fight bandits!  Care packages show you care.  Brie must really care.", "Love her or hate her, Xena had the safety of everyone foremost in her mind.  Even the people you think she doesn't care about.  Even when it was clear that the expedition had been deceived she was more focused on negotian than combat.", "Boars need love too.", "Oink, oink.  The other white meat.", "Despite having issues with him, mister Geradan has been most tolerant with mister Kafka and has been kind enough to not bring charges against him out of respect for the Bisclavret. I hear he intends to settle things one-on-one with Kafka rather than making a big to-do out of the whole affair. If I knew what the issue was exactly, I might brag more.", "I hear mister Greeves tried to trick miss Gemma into marriage using a cursed armband, and caused quite the scene due to it. Pretty sad if that's the only way he can get a woman, especially in a city so full of them.", "It seems Deputy Krell has taken to bad-mouthing Presbyter Ximen in public areas. Does the Constabulary have something against the Church all of the sudden, or is this a case of a Constable gone wild?", "After all the trouble that went into getting Chinco arrested, and all the talk about him refusing to lay down his arms when he was told he couldn't have them, the Sheriff failed to even ask mister Chinco to disarm when he took him into the jail proper. Oye, the Constabulary these days.", "Even after losing an honorable duel, mister Ilo refused to hold to the terms of said duel. Everyone knows better than to do that, honorable or otherwise.", "Captain Carlon has recently taken to teaching it seems, busying himself with correcting mister Kafka's behavior in public areas. Most recently, it was said that Kafka was teaching a female bad words in the commons and the Captain called him on it.", "While one can understand standing behind your employees, miss Bekka has taken it to an extreme, choosing to believe in mister Ilo's words rather than in the law, despite several cases being filed against him by the Constabulary alongside whole explanations with reasonings about the crimes that occurred and the consequences thereof.", "Miss Bekka seems to be persistent in harrassing the Constabulary about trying to get mister Ilo to file his testimony, even after repeatedly being told that the law works in a certain way, and individuals can't be proven innocent if they don't speak up for themselves.", "The Lord Baron very wisely called attention recently to the possibility of miss Una witnessing something potentially inappropraite at Baron Edmond's social. I hear the theme was named debauchery, and that it was hardly an event for a young girl's eyes.", "Despite being impaired by her lack of sight and not knowing the names of places, she offered to give miss Nasrin a tour of the city using her limited perception of smell. I'm certain that was quite the interesting tour!", "If you don't want your business heard, it's best not to conduct it around the Newtown courier, as Doctor Hush was said to be doing. Apparently a Noble took offense to her whispering and instructing her fellow cohorts to do the same while in the Noble's presence. Quite a rude and tactless display, especially when followed by leaving without so much as asking for leave or excusing yourself.", "I hear Doctor Hush offered cash prizes for the treasure hunt out of her very own pocket and was donating all the proceeds from the silent auction straight to charity. How generous of her!", "It seems rather high-handed of Captain Kaine to go around claiming Deputy Zaria as part of his Household. The Constables of a Rinaldi city are to remain unaffiliated with Households in order to do their duty neutrally and without bias. I hope he doesn't make her look bad to her superiors!", "What is with mister Chesh? Just read the case file on him and you'll see that not only did he threaten to assassinate and outright attack a Noble, but he also insulted the Constabulary while he was doing it! Really, just who raised this man? He's not going to last very long in town if he continues with this kind of behavior.", "Poor weasel, always being talked about. Rumor has it that he was stuck between filing testimony on his own behalf, and upholding the terms of an honorable duel. I hear he did his best to figure out a way to help explain his situation without breaking the terms of his agreement, and in the end, he decided to withhold testimony on his own behalf just to be sure he didn't say anything wrong. It's a pretty swell guy that will go to jail just to be sure he doesn't dishonor himself.", "While Chinco may be a well-known criminal and stubborn to boot, he did finally give up his weapons to the Constabulary. Is he simply afraid of losing his handsome head, or is he finally taking a step in the right direction? Hard to tell with that one.", "Mister Virendra certainly isn't the sharpest tool in the barn. So quickly after getting that brand on his forehead, he seems to be up to his old habits again. Implicated for murder? Another murder he was convicted for? I don't think that brand taught him anything at all.", "Miss Nan apparently agreed to provide the Constabulary with a list of which person was wearing what mask to the Avoirdupois social gathering. She aimed to keep the list private, but also ensure that nobody was able to do anything rotten while disguised. Everyone should be commending her for both her discretion and her concern for public safety.", "While Biggs has been left in charge of the Constabulary, he is rarely available for business, never answers his scrolls, and doesn't take the time to properly induct Deputies. Why, I hear Zaria has been working for the Constabulary for moons, and was never even told the first thing about her job!", "Did you hear? Lord Adrien allowed the slave, Lia, to act as the representative of the Doloreaux embassy at the Bisclavret social. Talk about inappropriate!", "Lord Adrien was said to have given a very inspiring speech at the Bisclavret social that encouraged unity amongst the four Houses.", "Some of the Nobility were a tidbit concerned about Lord Adrien's speech at the Bisclavret social. Rumors have it that he encouraged people to gorge themselves on large portions of food and become nearly too drunk to walk home. That sort of encouragement likely isn't what you want to be giving to Nobles, house members, and favored persons of the city, even if done in jest.", "People are raving about what a good shindig Lady Georgianna put on, and are commending her for actually getting senior members from all the Houses to attend. I hear the booze was flowing pretty good too, so that probably helped people's enjoyment of the event.", "Among a Lady, Rinaldi Reeve, various other commoners, and skinks, Lord Adrien chose to dance with a -slave- at his social instead of picking from one of the many other options.", "I understand miss Lia is a particularly friendly slave, but she shouldn't be allowing a Lord to embarrass himself at his own social by taking her to the dance floor before all of the other ranked females.", "Lady Georgianna was a good hostess at the Bisclavret Social. People say she was warm, welcoming, that she chatted with guests, and was generally a pleasure to be around.", "How rude to interrupt two Ladies engaged in conversation. Reports say Lady Georgianna and Lady Aria were discussing the recent flurry of socials at the Bisclavret event, and mister Clover just jumped right in with a topic change. Surely he could have waited until the conversation was concluded.", "Baron Edmond was forced to introduce himself to Willem the Falconer while speaking to Lord Adrien, Lady Georgianna and himself collectively. How rude is that? Nobles should know the rules of courtesy and make introductions accordingly.", "People understood Zaria wanting to shaer her love of the arts at the Bisclavret social, but reciting a poem and expecting folks to be quiet and listen when they were already engaged in other discussions was just too much, especially after Zaria was already told to wait for people to conclude their business. It was rude and inappropriate on the whole.", "Participated in the treasure hunt, and despite having difficulty with a problem, she refused to give up. Stubbornness, at times, can be something to admire.", "That treasure hunt Doctor Hush put on sure sounded like fun! All of it led to a party for charity too, so she was entertaining people and helping out the less fortunate. What a nice woman!", "Rumor has it that Paladin Noire stood silently by when Carolyn returned from the dead and was being taken away from public company by not only a heretic, but someone under suspicion for killing her. Isn't it the Church's job to watch over the faithful and the heretical both?", "When learning of mister Virendra's suspicion of killing miss Carolyn, she didn't hesitate to take up charge concerning the two going off alone.", "Miss Lotis took time out of her own schedule to clearn up the mess left on Market Street by people seeing to mister Ilo. Though such cleaning is the job of slaves, she was quite generous in volunteering and following through.", "Mister Auron was overheard talking about being exposed to the girl he's courting in the middle of the commons! How scandalous, even for Docktown. Keep some of your conversations for private, please.", "It's very Noble of Lia, slave or not, to hold true to her promise to miss Temperance and mister Zeiss, that even after Temperance's death, she continues to make sure Yulien, her child, is still taken care of.", "Captain Kaine assuaged mister Geradan by offering to talk to the Bisclavret Nobles about mister Kafka, who refused Geradan's challenge to duel via scroll. Smart thing that, since it would bring dishonor to the whole House if Geradan had to challenge Kafka more publicly.", "Polgara had a few people go with her to help find something she had lost. Even though they weren't able to find it, she paid the people for helping anyway. Now that's a good woman!", "Lady Aria is ever polite to those in her House, both in greeting them and in ensuring they are kept up to date with what's going on in the embassy.", "Despite past grievances with Sir Matteo, Lord Marcus was kind enough to welcome him back with open arms and a smile. If only everyone was party to such warm reunions.", "For once, mister Geradan took the lawful approach. In dealing with mister Kafka, when constantly goaded and called a heretic, he challenged the guard to a duel and laid out the terms clearly, as written by Mercutio di Rinaldi on the public boards. Handling things appropriately really pays off.", "Mister Kafka not only refused a duel with Geradan, but also accused the paladin of heresy, and sent him a soiled scroll as a finishing touch. Even for a Bisclavret guard, that's hardly appropriate or acceptable behavior.", "Miss Carolyn is apparently very kind. I hear she'll buy and donate things for and to the needy, even going so far as to deliver them into nasty places like the jailhouse just to make sure they are received by the proper party.", "Miss Madaline returned again to the city, and all she could do was shout orders at people to leave her presence. She even snapped at the Rinaldi Reeve, and ordered Guardsman Breeze to arrest mister Ilo for no apparent reason. Who does that woman think she is anyway? The Dona?", "Mister Virendra went into the commons making it a point to announce that he was wearing nothing but a comforter. While skimpy garb is regularly worn in Docktown, turning yourself into a spectacle in a public area to garner attention due to lack of clothing is hardly appropriate.", "When mister Virendra came out into the commons wearing nothing but a comforter, Gentleman Clover started making ribald jokes about Virendra's private bits, and even insinuated that people would want to see them. Aren't ranked members of society supposed to be good examples of behavior?", "Miss Bekka might like to claim her guild is different, but people believe she's just another in a chain of leaders who tries to recruit every single person the moment they step through the city gates rather than give them time to figure out the best direction to take. It might work for some, but others find bad fits and just end up leaving entirely.", "Upon entering the commons, Sir Althalus didn't even bother to acknowledge Lady Aria as protocol dictates. Instead, he simply turned heel and walked the other way! What a rude, curt gentleman.", "When miss Dahlia was desperately in need of kohl for her pagan social costume, mister Brenner didn't hesitate to send it to her in her hour of need. I guess if you need makeup, you know who to beg now.", "Miss Noe is most shrewd when it comes to business dealings. Not only does she have excessive skills with garments and hair, but she is able to skillfully negotiate favors and trade in exchange for said skills. Clearly she's a credit to her household.", "I hear at the pagan social Baron Edmond proclaimed his love for Lady Aria when she was too drunk to comprehend what he was saying. He even took vows with her of some sort while she was in that state. What sort of Noble takes advantage of another in that sort of situation? Shame on him!", "That mister Velasco has absolutely no manners whatsoever! He reportedly harrassed Guardswoman Breeze by placing his hand on her backsside despite her constant protests! He's just lucky it happened in Docktown instead of Newtown, or people would -really- have made an issue out of it. Clearly his lack of respect for women is already being acknowledged.", "For a Squire, she really is representing her Knight disfavorably by hanging around wit hthe excommunicated Harken Zeiss and joking about being killed by his hand in the commons.", "Squire Donatella's name continues to float around the gossip circle as she tries to find excuses to go up to mister Zeiss' rooms. Any girl going up there deserves whatever she gets after all his escapades, but for a Bisclavret Squire to pursue that course of action? Definitely bad form.", "Miss Donatella associates with an excommunicated man, mister Zeiss, and refuses to see how that might reflect on her person and house in a negative way. While the church does approve of people wanting to reach out and help him, she didn't make any mention of how her association with him accomplishes that. Her only justification at all was that, as a merchant, he has wares nobody else does. Sell your soul for a trinket anyone?", "When informed that people were publicly speaking about her relationship with mister Zeiss, miss Omen was quite rude and insisted that she be called Captain even though she possesses no rank whatsoever. She further threatened to take a Constable to task for warning her that her name was being bandied about in association with his.", "Miss Dahlia was wise enough to heed the words of the Constables when saving the life of Doctor Hush. They told everyone who weren't strong swimmers to stay on shore, and she stuck back and kept mister Fips from suffering the same fate as the Doctor.", "Girl fight! I hear miss Aradhyl was flirting inappropriately with mister Fyros in the commons, and in the presence of his suitor, Zaria. She was commenting on the subject of men always trying to get her out of her skirts due to mister Fyros requesting she not wear one while undergoing combat training with him. Did she cross the ilne by being disrespectful or were her words misconstrued out of touchiness? Either way, such jokes aren't for everyone - remember that.", "Despite knowing miss Emma was blind, and despite seeing her dressed only in her undergarments in public, he didn't say a word to her out of care of concern. You'd think such a long-standing member of the Bisclavret would be more of a gentleman and not visually take advantage of the situation.", "Sheriff Biggs rarely replies to scrolls in an acceptable amount of time and claims to do the paperwork that others in the Constabulary do themselves. There were cases that reportedly hadn't been closed for over a year, so those with pending punishments had to deal with them well past the time they should have. Not to mention there are several recruits of over a month waiting to be brought into the guard itself because the Sheriff has just been too lazy to get to it. All in all, he makes for a terrible person for that particular position, or so they're saying. Step it up, man, show them what you can do!", "When Doctor Hush took ill with poison, Dylan used his limited skills to the best of his ability to identify the problem and help deal with it.", "Now folk in Docktown like a good a good brawl and don't really mind Constables getting a little taste of their own medicine, but if you're going to draw weapons, you should at least have some excuse more than boredom.", "Volunteering to second Ilo in a duel and teach him the rules of it so he could handle it honorably. Apparently she has her own moments of honor as well.", "Ilo always seems to be in the midst of trouble, usually involving weapons, and then complains about it later. What did he expect when Jarek was already attacking Fyros and he accused Fyros of an attack in the sewers with no evidence by a vague memory of a dagger. He refused to press charges. He refused to stop, and when he was challenged to a duel over it, he complained about that too.", "After a long day of duels, brawls, fights and other nonsense, Doctor Hush tended the assorted injuries without complaint and without seeking coin. She spent hours at her labors. Healers can be so underappreciated.", "You never know what to expect from those new to town, but Aster did well helping out a bunch of wounded in the infirmary and having a gentle touch with Zaria. She made sure everyone was okay until a more experienced healer showed up.", "Let her employee draw blade and pick a fight for no real reason in the commons without trying to stop him, even drawing blade to defend him if it came to it. That's taking responsibility for your employees' actions.", "Apparently a lot of people noticed Jarek's unsolicited violence against the wounded Zaria and then to her defender when Fyros stepped in. If you're going to attack people out of the blue, at least try and do it in an alley or the Docks. That's almost what they're for.", "Xena, the fine Rinaldi aristocrat dueled Ilo on behalf of Fyros's honor with the terms that Ilo would recant his accusations about Fyros' attack. Fighting on behalf of another's honor can be honorable in it own right and suited to someone of station, or she must really feel something for Fyros to protect him so. You be the judge.", "She did her job well and worked to save a number of people while keeping good cheer the night of the Daemon constellation.", "Best be careful of that Fyros, he'll act like your friend but he'll still turn on you and even try to kill you in an instant. Watch your back, specially in the dark.", "Doctor Hush really put a lot of work into her Treasure Hunt in order to make fun for the participants.", "Captain Kaine realizes that a leader worries about every single person under his command. He regularly visited the infirmary to check on wounded guards and troops, including Tork.", "Breeze is a good and fair constable, appreciated for her thoughtfulnes and investigating accusations rather than just rushing ahead blindly with each one.", "Lady Georgianna was very considerate during the Bisclavret social to provide non alcoholic drinks for those of gentler disposition or sensibilities.", "Lord Adrien's speech at the Bisclavret social reinforced the sentiment which is often forgotten, the importance of the Houses working and coming together.", "Zaria was thoughtful enough to bring some Bisclavret poetry to their cultural social and recite it.", "Lady Georgianna's complaints that her husband doesn't hire chefs and cooks, but rather requests to only eat gruel and porridge would have been a minor comment, if only she hadn't said it to others of station who took note and raised eyebrows.", "Did you see the clothing Gemma was wearing at the Bisclavret banquet? Sharing your culture is one thing, but dressing like a Maison worker is another.", "Lord Edmond took the time to give Paladin Noire a dancing lesson during a social so that she might be more prepared for such events in the future.", "Captain Kaine escorted Lady Aria and Xena safely back to their rooms when no others were present to do so. It was especially thoughtful considering Xena was inebriated and could have easily fallen to harm without a guard nearby.", "It was quite thoughtful of Xena to suggest that the leftover food  from the Bisclavret social be donated to the poor.  We should always be thinking of those less  fortunate than ourselves.", "Yes, we get it you want people to know you're in looooove, but Auron really should have a little discretion. All the cuddling and touching right out in the commons is too much, but kissing Olena while folk are passing by is a bit much.", "Olena should really stop letting Auron snuggle, grope and kiss her right out in the commons in front of everyone all the time. Its not the place.", "Sang played incredibly well with a multitude of instruments for the Bisclavret social, From Bagpipes to a harpsichord, he can play it all with perfection.", "Fyros helped Doctor Hush with her treasure hunt, giving an especially interesting math problem for people to solve.", "For giving her money free to someone she knew very little about! The youngest daughter of thirteen never had much for herself, so Brie was very generous to treat Nasrin like so.", "Fyros is ever respectful and courteous.  While his position is that of personal body guard to the Lady Grazia, he always looks out not only for the members of his House, but for everyone in the town as well.  His brusque demeanor hides a deep loyalty to those around him. He even sacrificed his entire savings to help finance part of the expedition against the bandits.", "What a fool, goin to the jail peacefully woulda earned him some good words for his benefit, but instead he turns and attacks Zaria. The Bisclavret must be ashamed.", "Licking on Carolyn's ear in public, and inviting himself up to her room when she mentioned she was going to go upstairs and work on clothing for someone. Rude, and oh so naughty!", "Sir Matteo approached Xena about some rumors he heard regarding her, and was seemingly genuine in his concern about her happiness with the Household. It was a different Matteo than the one from years past who blabbed everyone's business to anyone who would listen.", "At risk to his own life, Fyros swam out into the riptide to save Doctor Hush from drowning a death on the bottom of the ocean.", "Despite being teased and flirted with by Fyros and Zaria together, she didnt get angry and throw a fit. She just asked to leave respectfully. She was challenged to act up and passed, she really is handling herself well lately.", "Kaine escorted Xena all the way back to her room because of her inebriation at Fyros' request. What a gentleman. Now the Rinaldi reeve being so drunk she repeatedly needs an escort to her rooms is another matter.", "Whispers say that Lady Aria and Baron Edmond have been going into one another's rooms without proper chaperones. While they have largely been successful in avoiding rumors altogether through discretion, this time they were caught by a sneaky Paladin who brought up the inappropriateness of the situation right in the middle of the commons, and in front of another Noble no less! Rule of thumb: If you're of station and don't want scandal surrounding you, don't enter a private room with someone of the opposite gender unless there's a third party available to attend.", "Seems people don't care too awful much about Nobles sneaking off together, but they do care if said Nobles get caught while doing it! Some lessons in subtlety seem to be in order for the Rinaldi's Lady Aria and the Avoirdupois' Baron Edmond.", "I hear miss Drewe made inappropriate commends during an impromptu meeting with the Interim Sheriff, Biggs, speaking on sharing her uniform with Recruit Kegan, despite the idea of uniforms for recruits being unallowed.", "Miss Omen stayed by Deputy Zaria's bedside the whole time she was on temporary stay in the infirmary, ensuring she was happy and cared for despite not having to. What a nice lass that one is.", "Miss Dahlia stayed by Deputy Zaria's bedside the whole time she was on temporary stay in the infirmary, ensuring she was happy and cared for despite not having to. What a nice lass that one is.", "I hear Kafka threw a temper tantrum in the commons over a couple tumblers of whiskey that were drunk. Was there really any need to lift Ilo by the scruff of his neck and threaten to burn off his face? Probably not .. Was there a need to afterward assault a Constable? Definitely not. The man just seems to be insane.", "Surprise, surprise. When it came to a promise Chinco made to Kafka, he refused to keep it and refrained from joining in on the assault of Deputy Zaria at the request of his boss, Clover LePlow. That's some sway the so-called Docktown Boss holds over Chinco.", "That Drewe sure is a lazy one, mocking other Constables for doing their jobs like she should be doing hers. In particular, I was told she made an inappropriate joke about Zaria's skull being broken and how hilarious it was, then proceeded to comment that she wouldn't ever involve herself in a scene or situation if she was off-duty. Doesn't she know Constables don't get time off?", "People are saying Rosaline isn't friendly at all, especially to other females! Word is that she gets angry if mister Niven talks to anybody else, even men like Clover LePlow, when she's around. Must be some sort of sickness expecting the world to revolve around oneself..", "They say Ford is a man worthy of trust. When a certain weasel was stabbed nearly to death, Ford was there guarding him even after he woke up.", "Mister Clover claims to be generous and helpful to everyone, especially newcomers. He's known for handing out coins to those newly arrived in the city. I hear he gave mister Eiryk 12 denarii so that he could manage his expenses until finding a job. Eiryk was offered one later in the day by miss Bekka who said he could work for her until he found another place. When Clover heard that Eiryk had agreed, he gave Eiryk a chiding and demanded the coins he had given earlier back. They say he never even suggested or asked mister Eiryk to join his guild or do anything in return for the coins to begin with. Why would you give coin to help people out until they find a job only to take it back if a job becomes available and they accept it? Is it possible there are strings attached to these monetary gifts?", "People aren't very happy that Clover is trying to intimidate Bekka by saying he's going to blacklist her guild in Docktown when they claim that all she's doing is trying to help people get settled in the city.", "I hear miss Aradhyl got involved in a conversation between two guildleaders, Bekka and Clover, about their business, even implying that Clover might send thugs after Bekka if she didn't listen or agree with what he was saying. That isn't the most courteous behavior for a member of a House.", "I hear mister Thukal got involved in a conversation between two guildleaders, Bekka and Clover, about their business, and implied the other guilds in town would be too scared of Clover's muscle to do anything, which might have just been an invitation for trouble.", "Bekka, in spite of appearances, is said to offer a wonderful service to those new in the city. For people who feel overwhelmed or a bit lost, she offers a sense of belonging as they find their place. For others, she offers a steady income and teachers along with introductions as they seek a permanent guild or House. While she might receive some benefits from doing these things, she never personally asks for anything from her members and cheers them on whether they wish to leave or stay. That seems a good and noble thing to do, aye?", "Sir Matteo is said to be spreading misinformation about the Rinaldi embassy, including that they never pay him. Further, instead of bringing his concerns about members of the embassy to the embassy itself, he insists on speaking to and in front of outsiders, airing his displeasure publicly. This kind of behavior is hardly befitting the manner a Rinaldi Lord should affect.", "Though Eiryk might be the last straw that caused Clover to be upset with Bekka's guild, he's unlike most new arrivals with no history or interest in about why Clover isn't happy. He actually listened and thought about what was said. A lad that listens and thinks? In this town? Craaazy!", "When hearing of mister Sang's lack of providing proper service to University customers, Doctor Hush offered to handle everything for only half the price of the work. Sang lacked doing a statue for someone for over a year while taking similar projects on before completing that order! Hush is doing well looking after such a difficult case.", "Despite the obvious urge to color the commons with mister Sinjaa's blood and bowels, mister Ford did resist and obey the Constabulary as well as advice from a Housemate to walk away and let the argument drop. What a good show for the Rinaldi House and its Guard!", "Deputy Breeze rescued a less experienced guard from having to try and stop a fight between two large tigers. The poor new recruit was trying to be brave, but it was pretty obvious the relief on her face when Breeze showed up and settled the matter peacefully.", "People seem to truly believe that miss Bekka's guild is made for newcomers to the city as a place for them to earn income and settle in before finding a final guild or house with which to end up. The fact that Clover is said to have blacklisted her for that is causing a mass of raised eyebrows and headshakes from those believing he's gone too far this time. What's he afraid of anyway, that Bekka might gain some power in Docktown?", "Despite being an obviously inexperienced guard  in the Constabulary, miss Aster did her best when ordering Ford and Sinjaa to stop their arguing and take it to the training yard. She kept her cool, but the relief on her face when Guardsman Breeze showed up and took over was pretty apparent. Whispers suggest there might be a good future in store for this one.", "Guardsman Breeze is apparently doing a great job in the Constabulary, and isn't afraid to put her own health and life on the line for her duty. She's said to be very experienced and knows the law and how it works inside and out.", "Mister Ford was heard implying that the Bisclavret didn't do their job correctly in regards to mister Kafka. Others seem to think they did themselves wonders as mister Kafka would have undoubtedly brought shame on the embassy due to his misdeeds.", "Miss Noe stepped up and stepped into the leadership position in House Avoirdupois unofficially. With Sir Bayard not having been around or being inattentive, she kept the House together and helped ensure it didn't become stagnate by encouraging the recruitment of new members, paying incomes out of her own pocket, and arranging for teachers for House members.", "Really?! Standing around in the commons clad in only a bra and pair of very short shorts while being kissed on various parts of her body by a servant boy? Certainly she can't be surprised when she brings all sorts of poor attention onto herself. Maybe the poor girl never had a mother to teach her properly ... awww, that's sad.", "Mister Eiryk volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "Miss Stacy volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "Miss Thaisa volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "Mister Syrith volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "Mister Tark volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "Miss Donatella volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "I heard Guardsman Breeze was urging people to not go look for injured survivors after the initial earthquake, and to only take care of themselves. That doesn't seem very civic minded, does it?", "That Lieutenant Tonozzi! When the earth started shaking, she took it upon herself to go search for injured survivors in need of help, putting their safety before her own! The Bisclavret should be glad to be represented by someone so responsible and selfless!", "Mister Tark was kind enough to make iron shields for everyone during the earthquakes to protect them from falling debris! I'm sure he lost out on some profits, but it was good of him to put the safety of the city before his own business.", "I hear Clover stepped up and organized a rescue operation after the earthquake. Cheers for someone taking the reigns and leading.", "Apparently Mathias was really curt to his housemate Thaisa without even offering explanation as to why he forbade her to ever go help hunt spiders. He never even bothered to ask why she was going or what had happened! That's certainly not the way to build authority within an embassy.", "I hear that mister Fyros went out and searched for people in Docktown after the earthquake hit. How heroic!", "Mister Tarquin stepped up and aided Clover in doing a search for miss Thaisa and Gentleman Mathias who were reported missing after the earthquake hit.", "Miss Stacy stepped up and aided Clover in doing a search for miss Thaisa and Gentleman Mathias who were reported missing after the earthquake hit.", "Apparently miss Thaisa argued with two gentry who came in to help Gentleman Mathias after he was abandoned indoors while napping just after an earthquake. Valuable time was wasted because of this and teh chances everyone might have gotten hurt or killed increased too! People need to know when to shut their yaps!", "That miss Thaisa, I can't believe her! When a member of her House was injured, she lost her temper and told everyone else to leave, saying she'd look after him. When folk got mad about being ordered around by some unknown, rude commoner, she started talking about how he was 'her Protector' and how she 'couldn't leave him' and was 'just trying to help'. Then she up and left the Cathedral in a huff! So much for not being able to leave, eh?", "Deputy Zaria stuck by Dunwasser Fieldway, keeping peace and assisting with the wounded all night and day amidst the ongoing earthquakes. What a fantastic Constable, and how relieving to know there are some good ones working hard for the city!", "Apparently the Church took to gathering the poor and others of Docktown and escorting them to a camp outside the city where they could take care of them. Paladin Iare even let those in Dunwasser Fieldway know in case they needed to move somewhere safe too. Egads, the Church is doing good deeds. Ximen must be horrified!", "Virendra was heard talking about having sex with Carolyn in the refugee camp. He pretended he was just trying to lift people's spirits, but really he was just tarnishing her name and being very, very inappropriate.", "Choices sometimes come back to haunt you, and taking up with the self-destructive heretic Virendra to head off in the middle of an emergency for sex and games looks to be one of those decisions. His talking about it in public before Knights and commoners is probably what she deserves for being so inappropriate.", "Walking around naked during an earthquake tragedy is one thing, but having sex in Docktown and precarious buildings is quite another. What's she thinking making the love at a time like that? One has to wonder why she's Lady Aria's companion at all.", "I hear Virendra announced in a crowded Dunwasser Fieldway that he and miss Carolyn were heading off to the cathouse, tra-la-la. How improper! And also against the advice of staying in the safe zone during the earthquakes.", "Mister Thukal was said to have shown a complete lack of regard for both the state of the city, and the fact that there were murderers on the loose. He preferred to linger in Docktown over going somewhere safe, and showed a distinct lack of care for the safety of his house nobles.", "Guardswoman Breeze very dutifully risked her own safety to make sure that Docktown was evacuated during the earthquakes, keeping calm and level-headed. She proved to be a good leader during the crisis.", "Mister Jayland instantly obeyed the orders of the Constabulary to evacuate Docktown during the earthquakes, and even brought lumber to the camp in the field for use in creating shelter and protection.", "The new recruit to the Constabulary has acted professionally in every situation. He went so far as to travel down into Docktown at its most dangerous to assess the safety of the Bay and help evacuate people during the earthquakes. It's not too long before a man like that will be promoted!", "Mister Eiryk reportedly sent a scroll to Guardswoman Breeze sharing the latest news about evacuating the city due to the earthquakes and disclosing any scouting that had been done. It was good of him to make sure she was kept up to date on developments when she wasn't able to see and hear them for herself.", "Without thought for himself, Suavis is constantly serving in his capacity as a healer. He found vials and collected blood from donors for people during the earthquake without complaint or hesitation. He's said to always be ready and available to help those in need.", "Always willing to serve, Suavis entered Docktown, despite danger to himself, to retrieve vials for the collection of blood in payment to the sylphs. Despite it not being enough to withhold their elemental wrath, he sure did his part to attempt to save the city!", "Miss Senora generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Miss Stacy generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Zev generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Kegan generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Miss Zaria generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Thukal generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Jayland generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Eiryk generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Miss Adora generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Ford generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Ilo generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Cullan generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Kheldon generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Miss Polgara generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Fyros generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Tark generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Oushi generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Miss Dahlia generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Dylan generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Paladin Iare generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Rumor has it that Ilo ran to fetch the sword that was to be offered up to the air elementals, making quite an effort to be helpful during the event.", "Deputy Zaria was one of the only Constables willing to do her duty, staying behind to help people evacuate the city, even after knowing that a tidal wave was imminent.", "Word has it that miss Chen actually sacrificed herself to save Guardswoman Breeze during the tidal wave. What a trooper, and how surprising!", "Even after most others had left, Deputy Zaria returned to the city to help those still inside escape from the massive tidal wave that struck. Talk about being dutiful!", "Even after most others had left, Guardswoman Breeze returned to the city to help those still inside escape from the massive tidal wave that struck. Talk about being dutiful!", "Did you know that miss Izzy died trying to help save Dazrene from drowning? It's true! She even remained useful in death, serving as a floaty to keep Dazrene above water.", "Father Ramses, fearing for his own life and praying to the great S'allumer, reached for the people who were being pulled back by the water regardless of it compromising his own safety. If that's not a representative of the Light then don't know what is!", "Begrudingly someone told me that Guardswoman Breeze tried to save them from the tsunami. Something was mumbled about it being ridiculous how unselfish people are, but gratitude was shown nonetheless. Yay for heroes!", "Despite being severely weakened herself from the flood waters, Deputy Zaria went back for miss Elgin, stating she couldn't leave her behind. Idiotic heroics or a genuine care for preserving life? Who knows!", "Despite physical exhaustion making the task at hand difficult, miss Elgin took charge over Deputy Zaria and determinedly pulled her to safety ensuring she didn't succumb to the flood waters.", "The nerve of that Bekka! I hear she accused those involved in trying to save the city from the sylphs and water elementals heretical! What's heretical about wanting to work things out and possibly prevent a tidal wave? Grr .. grr ..", "Despite claiming that everyone who tried to appease the sylphs were heretical, miss Bekka wrote down a list of to-dos for the next few steps of the journey; how to aid the city, and how to keep everyone safe. Even if she doesn't know what she's talking about, she does try to be helpful.", "I hear miss Achlys risked her own life and health to fetch the corpse of Baron Edmond from within the flooded city walls of Triskellian. How brave!", "The Lady Theressa put on a huge display at the sight of Baron Edmond's corpse, blubbering and carrying on like nothing you've ever seen. While one can understand her grief, her overt behavior wasn't at all appropriate for a woman of her standing.", "Mister Eiryk has been helping to take care of refugees and is going above and beyond his duty as a worker for miss Bekka (though we don't really know what duties he actually has). I heard he even trained and was trying to get more capable people to assist with things more.", "Miss Stacy has been helping to heal people hurt by the tidal wave, learned more about healing, has taken care of refugees, and generally is undertaking more than her job and duty entails. They say she's a really nice minky ..", "Miss Una took it upon herself to find out who was doing what jobs at the farmhouse after the tidal wave and she appointed leaders in various areas in order to make things go more smoothly and effectively.", "I heard Chinco was bickering at the farmhouse with people, being completely unresponsive to anyone but Fyros when it came to helping out with what needed to be done. Why the loyalty to Fyros anyway?", "Diligent and stubborn, mister Kegan refuses to let even weariness hinder what he needs to do. In the absence of his superiors he took up responsibility of ensuring the safety and keeping law and order at the farm, despite being only a recruit in the Constabulary.", "Bekka worked tirelessly to assist the injured and newcomers at the farmhouse camp. She took care to provide food, water, and even a place to worship. Above and beyond that, she thought to make a list on which to write the names of missing and found people. What a wonderful birman!", "Bekka really took charge seeing that everyone was as comfortable as possible after the tidal wave. She made sure people had enough food, water, and even volunteered to act as a courier if needed. She also took initiative making up a list of survivors that showed up at the farmhouse so people could check for their loved ones.", "Word has it that when someone at the farm was grieving due to personal loss, miss Lidia scented herself with an alluring perfume and attempted to be flirtatious with the man despite the fact he was just hoping for a comforting presence. How inappropriate!", "When the city was at its worst, and people were being killed in quakes and floods, the Doloreaux promised to help the sylphs in order to attempt to stop the disasters. Not only did they not fulfill their promises, but they abandoned the task requested of them, and quit the city at Lord Samstag's orders without word of apology or any hint of the aid promised. Talk about poor leadership and great disappointment.", "Miss Bekka did amazing work during the crisis that hit the city, organizing people and making sure the evacuation of the town was as efficient as possible. Good for her!", "People are boggling over the nerve of Doctor Hush who reportedly stormed out of the barracks at the farmhouse and abandoned the Rinaldi Lieutenant Sunta who was dying of a fever right in front of everyone. What happened to that caring and kind healer we've heard so much about?", "Didja hear? Donatella knocked out some of Virendra's teeth for trying to ruin a wedding! Good for her setting him straight and giving him what he deserved for interfering with a happy day of matrimony. It might not have been the most polite way to handle it, but people seem to agree it was what needed to be done.", "I hear Lieutenant Sunta killed the leader of the drays at the farm and kept standing strong despite how badly she was hurt from the event.", "Mister Josef apparently approached Clover LePlow, getting grabby with his stuff, while he was trying to talk with a Noble about the refugees and city status. That's not just poor manners, it's asking to be hurt!", "Mister Clover may be unpolished, but when it comes to knowing his place under Rinaldi authority, he is more than willing to bow to direction. He's glad to lend his man to help check out the city, and agrees to do it under Rinaldi orders.", "Miss Achlys helped with the scouting of Triskellian to see if and when it would be safe to return to the city. Without people like her, it would be a guessing game!", "Despite the fact that mister Tark prefers cremation over burial, it wasn't the appropriate comment to make while transferring coffins into a wagon while the people hadn't had a chance to be revived.", "Miss Sable did a good job during the tidal wave crisis keeping track of people and things, and even arranging for dray meat to be jerked so it would last the refugees longer than it otherwise would.", "Mister Eiryk really knows how to use common sense. When the sylph gave a warning about an elemental creature that the city needed to deal with, he thought on options and how it might negatively effect the town by angering yet another magical being. Foresight in times of crisis is rather proper and welcome.", "Clover brought reports from his scouts to Lady Aria out of respect, deferred to her on the scouting by miss Achlys, brought additional information about the gates provided by one of his men and was actively supporting the city, but she consistently was intent on offering neither thanks nor respect for what had been done. Gratitude goes a long way!", "Where was Lord Twyrch when survivors were stuck and injured and unable to get away from the city, or when bandits started preying on small groups? Who knows, but suddenly he's ready to lead the way into the city when it seems safe to re-enter after the tidal wave. Talk about glory hunting..", "Instead of banding together with the rest of the city to help kill the beast that encroached upon their homes, Clover decided to utilize his time attempting to force the Rinaldi into supporting the return of mister Chinco's arms. Hardly a noble or honorable thing as would be expected of a gentryman; in fact, it's much more similar to the behavior of a Docktown thug.", "With much difficulty, mister Sang willingly lent out his bracelet to assist people with entering town through the waterway so that the gate could be opened within. Without it people might still be stuck out at that camp..", "During the siege of Triskellian to return to the city, Biggs was the only one who sought orders rather than causing mayhem by constantly shooting down anything anyone said.", "Mister Fyros really stayed in the middle of things during the octopus fight, seemingly putting his spear into the beast more than most others.", "Miss Zarie did a good job bandaging up Clover in the middle of the octopus fight. Her efforts should be commended.", "Whatever else you might say about Lady Aria, she isn't a coward. She was willing to put herself right into the thick of things to fight for the city, which isn't what you'd expect from a highborn lady.", "It was nice of Omen to give the head of the big dray that people were fighting to Sunta. Sunta did most of the damage and nearly died because of it, but Omen got in the last shot. She was generous to gift it as a show of respect.", "People seem to be noticing that Chinco's working on changing his ways. Apparently he's even being thoughtful, checking up on wounded House guards like Sunta (shock of shocks) to see if they need anything. If this keeps up he might even smile at a Constable someday. Yeah .. prolly not.", "It came as a surprise when Chinco popped in and asked a wounded Rinaldi guard if the needed anything. Certainly looks like his behavior is changing for the better!", "Guardswoman Breeze lets witnesses know they're meant to testify, but she doesn't let the suspects know that they also need to deliver a testimony. Intentional or not? I don't know, but the people seem to think it's the job of a Constable to make sure everyone knows everything.", "Despite Deputy Zaria requesting an increase in income several times to fit the job she was doing for the Constabulary, Sheriff Biggs ignored all her scrolls and inquiries and didn't even acknowledge that she wished to speak with him!", "Miss Achlys took to the sky and scouted the city, discovering a dangerous beast lurking within! She followed orders without hesitation and, despite her small stature, did a very big job. Nicely done!", "Lieutenant Sunta took on the dray pack leader with skill and bravery, protecting several others present from its vicious attacks. She was terrible wounded during the fighting and dealt great blows to the rampaging creature. Skill, grace, and ferocity -- that's Sunta!", "Miss Omen kept watch at the farm for stampeding drays, and even managed to kill a few during the first hunt of them. She's a lot tougher than she looks, they say, and is reportedly a sweetiepie to boot .. if you know how treat her right.", "Omen gave the trophy of the dray pack leader to Sunta, even though she landed the killing blow herself. She could have tried to selfishly keep it, but being the honorable type, she gave it up without any fuss at all. I say, good show!", "Physician Suavis saved Sunta's life! With mister Fyros as his assistant, he leapt into action rescuing the Lieutenant from the certain death that was surely awaiting her due to the beating she took from the dray pack leader.", "Sang was reportedly standing around in the commons calling the Don foolish, calling Lord Twyrch foolish, and indicating that both of their military knowledge is lesser than his own. What kind of a man calls the Don foolish, honestly?", "Despite a past of taking insult at the slightest comment an attacking others out of boredom, Chinco educated a newcomer of the city on who they could turn to for training in combative arts outside of himself.", "While some details are vague, confessing that she sometimes lets men see her breasts the first time they meet her is at the very least inappropriate.  Lets hope she meant in the bath house.", "Risking life and limb for the sake of a house member shows true dedication and loyalty. Aria went on the bandit expedition to haggle and came home a hero.", "That lioness is smooth and smart.  She stepped in when Aradhyl started publicly slandering another guild that would have hurt the Rinaldi.  Maybe she knows that cookies solve all disputes.", "Xena looked high and low for some friends. It's good to have her in your corner.", "Not even earthquakes can stop the generosity and heroics of Clover. He spent his own resources for the refugees in Dunwasser field and even initiated the search for missing people.", "Even though it was in the best of intentions Anne left the safety of newtown to check on house members. She took a long time and made people worry over her absence because she couldn't be bothered to send word of her safety.", "Used his bronze and his  brains to help with the reinforcements of the sewers after the earthquakes.  He personally helped rebuild a bridge and sent the carpenters to other locations.", "Elgin faced dangerous flood waters to try and save Caitriona.  Maybe Avoirdupois aren't afraid of scary water.", "She put her life on the line when she courageously came back to the flooded town to help people escape the water.", "For being a cat Zaria sure didn't mind jumping right in to try and save Caitriona from the perils of the flood water. Maybe her fur is water proof.", "With  the last of her strength and the help of some others Zaria  tried to rescue Elgin from the rushing flood water. Some call that bravery, others call it stupidity, either way lets hope they all made it out alive.", "Was a real trooper and heroic man when he made sure that his house members made it out of town after the flood waters became dangerous.", "Caitriona tried to save the last group of people leaving from the city when the flood waters were coming! When they hit and Izzy went under for a moment, she reached for her without hesitation! Thats a brave, Bisclavret raised wolfette for you!", "What's with the nurse, always asking people to run letters for her?", "During a tea party hosted by Doctor Hush and mister Fips, Virendra inquired if there was a tea around that could induce arousal. Hardly the most desirable topic of conversation for a polite and public event.", "People are raving about what a great hostess Doctor Hush is. They say she's the perfect picture of social etiquette, ensuring everyone is comfortable, engaged, and providing anybody who attends her events with refreshments.", "Can anyone ever say enough about Doctor Hush? Some people believe that she saved their lives, and note that she's given over expensive healing jars to keep death at bay while conducting surgery. There are your average healers, and then there are devoted healers like her.", "Though Doctor Hush was supposed to give a public speech, Fips stood up and took over, despite nerves, to cater to the waiting people.", "Pompous, arrogant, and rude are three of the words recently used to describe mister Edwardo. I heard that he demanded to be invited along on a dinner date between two courting people, and then insisted the gentleman he and the woman were with had to pay because he was their escort, even though his company was never wanted to begin with. Talk about unbecoming behavior for someone who claims to serve a Noble house.", "Doctor Hush generously co-hosted the Summer Garden Party with mister Fips, and held a talk on the medicinal uses of a variety of herbs. We should all be grateful that she shared her knowledge.", "Miss Rosaline helped mister Fips set up and run the Summer Garden Party, and also lent her prized plum tree for people to see and touch amidst the many other plants on show. How generous of her!", "Want to hear all about mister Fred and miss Natalie's sex life? Apparently you just have to mill about in the west commons and the information will be shared freely by the two, or so witnesses say.", "Miss Valora was kind enough to assist in clearing the rubble from the crack in the wall near the beach at Turret's End. Diligence and hard work are a good way to earn favor from your peers!", "Mister Sang was kind enough to assist in clearing the rubble from the crack in the wall near the beach at Turret's End. Diligence and hard work are a good way to earn favor from your peers!", "Miss Gemma was kind enough to assist in clearing the rubble from the crack in the wall near the beach at Turret's End. Diligence and hard work are a good way to earn favor from your peers!", "Miss Sable was kind enough to assist in clearing the rubble from the crack in the wall near the beach at Turret's End. Diligence and hard work are a good way to earn favor from your peers!", "Mister Virendra was kind enough to assist in clearing the rubble from the crack in the wall near the beach at Turret's End. Diligence and hard work are a good way to earn favor from your peers!", "The Constables are all excited that Deputy Zaria has caught up on the paperwork, sorted through all the old crime records, and has begun closing cases and getting everything in order. What a relief to finally have some organization.", "Even though she was just kidding around, Deputy Zaria asked Virendra to kneel down and be 'her chair'. After he did as she asked, she actually sat on his back! The people around who witnessed it found it be a very embarrassing situation, especially considering she represents the Constabulary.", "I hear Virendra paraded around the commons naked and was clearly heard making inappropriate suggestions to the women present. I know it's Docktown, but some behavior isn't even appropriate for the slums.", "It's said that miss Althea is playful to the point of displaying childish behavior, regardless of whom she's around. Most recently, she was seen acting this way in the presence of Constabulary members and Nobles of her own house in a public area. *tisk tisk*", "I heard that mister Kesari ran away and hid in his room when he was about to be arrested. Talk about cowardly and dishonorable behavior!", "Miss Aluine encouraged mister Seeley to give her a hug upon meeting him for the very first time. While consensual hugs in general are fine amongst friends, that kind of close and familiar behavior between strangers is inappropriate.", "Need a lesson in soldiering? You should look up miss Sable, who is currently training members of the Constabulary in the field. I don't know whether it's free or not, but it's good to know the education is out there.", "When the Constabulary confronted mister Kesari and stated he was to be arrested for his newest crimes, he had the sense to consent and go along without any resistance. Now there's a good chap.", "Mister Damien sure is a smart fellow. He himself sought out the Constabulary to deal with the fines he was charged to pay for disturbing the peace in his defense of a Noble. That's a good way to keep everyone happy and impressed!", "Out of all the registered militia, Captain Kaine was the only one to reply and be willing to aid with the capture of the serial killer Luciano.", "Intent on solving the labyrinth on Doctor Hush's blouse, Deputy Krell didn't realize that he was in fact staring at her bosom, which made a few people in the commons uncomfortable. Besides that, he's a Constable, and he should be setting the right example.", "Two months since Chesh turned himself into the Constabulary and Sheriff Biggs, as per his bond terms, and the Sheriff still hasn't arranged to give Clover back the coin he put up for Chesh's bond. That's a long time to wait for reimbursement.", "Though it was all in a bit of fun, it wasn't the most appropriate thing for miss Izzy to push herself beneath Nix's clothing and pretendingly manipulate his limbs in the commons.", "Acted quickly and decisively when Fyros was hurt and needed a doctor.  She also stuck by him afterwards to help take care of him. What are friends for I ask you?", "Allowing a woman to touch you is one thing. Letting a woman lift your shirt and caresses you intimately is another thing.  Nix should know better being a guard for the Avoirdupois.", "Whips are scary.  When someone is afraid of the whip you shouldn't purposefully scare them by cracking it near them.  Besides, wielding your weapon is a no no dontcha know.", "Lia went above and beyond the call of duty by not only educating a new healer but giving her own supplies to the new person.  Makes you wonder where the slave gets her supplies from that she can give them away so easily.", "Knew he would likely not be able to take down a mass murderer but he tried anyways. It's the thought that counts right?", "Did his duty and tried his best to take down a mass murderer. There is a proper man of the militia.", "Threatening a constable.  Tisk tisk. They are peace keepers you should know better than to vent to them even if you do have to take care of things yourself.", "Aided the constabulary guarding Ilo when he as threatened and by listening to rumours for info.  What a good citizen.", "Showing an inapproperiate picture of Virendra to the east commons, while funny, is just no something to codone.", "Trying to start a fight in the infirmary is not a thing you should do no matter who you are wanting to fight with.  You should not invoke violence when doctors are trying to heal people in a place of peace.  What's next fighting in the church?", "Worked hard to help the doctors while healing the deputies.  He dabbed blood and was eager to aid any way he was able.   He does know how to listen once in a while, go figure.", "Mister Ilo reportedly was ready and prompt when Doctor Hush needed an extra pair of hands with a patient. He is said to have dabbed away blood, and helped to cauterize a wound while remaining calm throughout the ordeal.", "That Virendra tried to start a fight in the infirmary where hurt people were trying to recuperate! Talk about the wrong place to spread chaos; the Doctors were very unappreciative.", "Eager to do her job, Doctor Hush worked tirelessly to cauterize, stitch, bandage, and medicate the Deputies and others in need during the chaotic capture of the mass murderer Luciano. If there's need of healing, she's the woman to turn to for sure!", "Despite having many opportunities and chances given to him by miss Bekka, Ilo is going around being excessively drunk and ungrateful to all of his friends and distantly related cousins. He should learn to show some appreciation.", "Mister Niven isn't perfect, but he's good enough to acknowledge and try to fix his mistakes. I hear when he messed up on miss Achlys' order, he sent her a free pestle as an apology to ensure she didn't have a negative view of his business.", "Miss Achlys has taken it upon herself to show Deputy Kegan some of the criminal hide-outs in Triskellian. If you're shady and were friends with her before, you might reconsider your relationship.", "Miss Zaria is being recognized around town for having a presence with the Constabulary while they're catching lots of flack from residents. People sincerely believe she's trying to better and more honest, both on a personal level and a professional level.", "Sir Matteo reportedly promised to donate a gun to Doctor Hush's charity auction, which was set up to make money for expanding the infirmary. He not only broke his promise to her, but he gave the gun away to someone else, and never even apologized!

It wouldn't be a big problem, but then she started arguing with Deacon Ximen and Pastor Savryn about whether it was appropriate or not. It's a give-in that harlots aren't smart, but to argue with the church?!", "Did you see Pastor Savryn help Deacon Ximen explain the Light to miss Yvara? She was being thick, frankly, but Savryn kept a cool head on his shoulders thanks to proper holy training.", "Miss Yvara was doomed from the start reportedly. First she tried to defend miss Rae's nearly nude outfit to the church clergy, and then she started to criticize Deacon Ximen in public! She even went so far as to try and cast doubt on the wisdom of the Holy See and their authorities.", "The Light will fall warmly upon Deacon Ximen's shoulders after he set a near harlot straight in the commons. Miss Rae, dressed like a whore, and defending her outfit as appropriate attire, seemed misled and destined for a dark and troubled life. Fortunately, the Deacon's counsel convinced her to accept his charity and dress in more modestly cut wool garments. It's easy to understand why the Deacon has risen so much in the Church hierarchy.", "That Chinco wolf threw a half-eaten apple core into the chapel! When one of the clergy came out to ask who threw it, Chinco was rude and disrespectful, claiming they should thank him for the gift. Further, he refused to give his name to the Church despite several prompts.", "That Chinco wolf threw a half-eaten apple core into the Chapel! When one of the clergy came out to ask who threw it, Chinco was rude and disrespectful claiming they should thank him for the gift. After he refused to give his name to Church members, despite several prompts, Esquire Meepers of House Rinaldi was asked to identify the rabble-rouser, and she refused. It certainly seemed like she knew exactly who did it by the way she and Chinco were smirking betwixt each other.", "A new citizen to town, Fee, is singing the praises of Virendra, saying that they would have been unable to start upon their archery path for a whole month if it wasn't for Vir providing the bow, arrows, quiver, and archer gloves to assist in getting started. How strangely generous!", "One of Sheriff Zaria's own militia harassed and attacked an old man, right in the middle of the commons, and she just stood there, watching and looking bored. After the fact, she goes and throws a cup of water in the poor man's face .. in the dead of winter, no less! It seems like she's less in control of herself than her own subordinates, and what poor behavior for someone in a position of power.", "People are still babbling about Sheriff Zaria doing nothing to aid old mister Samuel while he was being attacked in the commons by mister Jardskjalfti. She merely sat there before proceeding to dump a mug of water on the victim. What a disgrace!", "While one of mister Hanneman's fellow house comrades verbally and physically attacked an old goat, Hanneman idled around and just watched, saying nothing. This seems to be a growing trend in the discipline of the Avoirdupois guard.", "Mister Virendra bravely guarded Pastor Savryn during a recent expedition to Paludestris. The Church is starting to believe he'd make a fine Paladin.", "What's this?! I hear Esquire Dasha was inappropriately whispering to Doctor Hush about sexual antics in front of Fips, the good Doctor's husband, while he was unawares of their private conversation. And when the subject was made audible to the public, propositions such as group sex between the Esquire and three other men were suggested! Not at all appropriate for someone of her rank! What would the Rinaldi think?", "Valdus can't be trusted all, sources say. When was feeling down and alone, Virendra tried taking him aside and encouraging him to try to be a better person, even pointing Valdus in the right direction to start. How does Val pay him back? Why, by trying to cozy up to the woman Virendra is suiting, of course.", "Mister Virendra put the entire group in danger during an investigation in Lord Dubane's manor when he decided to wantonly strangle the butler for some stupid reason. Well, at least Lord Dubane shot only him for it.", "Well, after the way Virendra carried on in Dubane's manor, being as subtle as a brick and strangling the Lord's butler on a whim, he's lucky he only got himself shot in the face and not all the other people who were actually trying to get their jobs done.", "As expected from a Captain of the Avoirdupois (even if they take the shop of a fox), mister Hanneman attended the prayers of Father Ramses on the day of devotionals.", "Who does mister Virendra think he is .. talking about eating .. private parts in the commons? It definitely wasn't innocent! But I suppose that's the nastiness you get in Docktown. Ugh!", "Who does mister Chinco think he is .. talking about eating .. private parts in the commons? It definitely wasn't innocent! But I suppose that's the nastiness you get in Docktown. Ugh!", "Lady Georgianna arrived about the time Esquire Meepers was taking care of miss Carolyn and miss Carolyn was making an order where she was going to use some of the only crushed velvet left in the city. The Lady asked if there would be plenty left for her to place an order, and Carolyn offered to let the Lady order first, but Georgianna told her to go ahead instead. How nice of her, someone of her station .. she didn't owe any favors to Carolyn, but she stepped aside anyway and parted with the rare material.", "Right, so I know healers have to earn money for doing their job and all, but charging one hundred and fifty denarii to save a man's life? Now that's a bit steep. That bat Achlys isn't so nice now, is she?", "Lady Antonia isn't particularly grateful, is she? I hear she had to be reminded to thank the Deacon for saving Dame Xena, but did remember to fuss about what was traded to find her cure.", "The heretic Virendra cannot stop causing problems, and is continuously looking for reasons to fight people. He managed to turn the whole commons against him recently when he accused a master medic and an Avoirdupois captain of misconduct. As if he has a foot to stand on regarding misconduct .. heh.", "Even though it's not his job, Jardskjalfti took a personal interest in the murders Razeer and Samuel were accused of, and, despite not being literate, found someone to translate and came up with several solutions and answers to the conundrum.", "Chinco hasn't changed at all! Deputy Carrot asked him over to the gaol to discuss his crime against the church and he declined saying he would draw his sword against the Constable if he tried. It makes a Constable's job very hard. The Guild Council might want to look into reinstating his ban on carrying weapons!", "Generally speaking, making a deal with a member of the Constabulary where they gut themselves in some form of ritualistic suicide in order to speak without drawing a weapon about numerous convictions and law-breaking is frowned upon. But -- to then also stand there taunting shows very little class. For shame! Even he's better than that .. or so people thought.", "Despite his often questionable choices, Virendra was more than willing to aid the Constabulary in bringing in two very dangerous criminals and seeing justice served. He jumped into the fray and had the presence of mind to disarm Luciano when he was put out of action, and while the Sheriff and a Constable's attention was on Chinco. Well done.", "Mister Chesh instantly and unquestioningly sided with the Constabulary when it looked like they might need an extra hand tackling Chinco and Luciano. Maybe he has turned into a good guy?", "Together with Chesh, Virendra, and Deputy Carrot, the Sheriff stood up to Chinco and Luciano, who refused to answer for their crimes quietly. She lead from the front, and was engaged in combat until both yielded. Once they were defeated and disarmed, she had them both moved to the gaol where they were brought to justice for their crimes. Excellent work, Sheriff, the streets are a lot safer!", "Valiant Valdus jumped in front of a helpless girl during a terrible explosion! He took on all the flames for her -- ahh, what a gentleman.", "It's one thing to defend yourself when being attacked, but to go so far as to just outright kill those attacking you, especially when they don't have any martial experience, is just stooping too low. What happened to letting the law deal with matters? Who does Valdus think he is, being both judge and executioner?", "Father Antos stood up for the values of the church, questioning Deacon Ximen's need to hunt skinks and use their blood, despite the Deacon appearing very snappy, and his known reputation. He also was brave enough to speak up about Virendra being a Paladin Initiate in spite of his H-branded forehead. It takes guts to confront the daily leader of the Church -- especially someone like Ximen.", "Despite being told by the Sheriff not to pick the shadow crawler plant in the arena, Virendra went behind her back and very nearly manipulated Sang into retrieving it for him. When the Sheriff walked in on Sang trying to get the plant for Virendra, with no knowledge on what the plant actually did, Virendra stepped right into Zaria's face and blatantly mocked her by saying she used her title as Sheriff as armor, said he could do anything he wanted, and told her he had no respect for her anyway. Paladin Initiate? Not for long.", "Constable Drosnan doesn't do his job very well. When he brought in a criminal, he allowed the alleged party to remain fully suited in armor for the duration of his stay in the gaol. Smaaaart.", "Hunting skinks in the commons, and smearing the blood all over his face in the name of some church ritual? What has Deacon Ximen fallen to? He's even becoming agitated and upset over not being able to catch a skink. I think Ximen has forgotten his dignity and how to behave properly.", "Did you hear what Zaria did in West Triskellian? It was amazing! She chased down, mounted, and captured a frickin' armored higg'n dray! These things are huuge, easily big enough to bowl over a group of people, and she was all like 'Grrrr .. yous mine now.' Oh yeah, she also returned some items to a crazy old man, and lead troops into battle with mister Hanneman.", "I hear Presbyter Ximen is always looking for information pertaining to the church or heretics. The more useful the information is, the more handsomely he pays. It might not be such a bad idea to sell that one person out, hm?", "Mister Hanneman took over command of the troops from the wildly inexperienced miss Zanthia who was tasked with heading the trip as Reeve of the Rinaldi. His tactics and management made the fight a breeze and ultimately meant that fewer people got injured.", "I'm not quite sure Virendra is right in the head. In what world does a sane person conceive of the idea that setting his hands on fire with whiskey in order to fight a spider is smart?! The spider caught fire, sure, but then the Sheriff and others were put in unnecessary danger. It's not exactly what you need from people that are supposed to be looking out for you.", "Mister Hanneman was invaluable during the siege on West Triskellian and the invading Jadelanders. He helped solve the puzzles at the old tiger's crooked house, scouted out much-needed information, and directed troops efficiently against the magic and numbers of the foreign enemies so that losses were minimal despite the lack of healers. Fantastic!", "Despite having little knowledge on war, miss Zanthia showed courage in representing the Rinaldi on the battlefield, and even pretended to be a Rinaldi prisoner so that the faux 'mercenary' company could enter West Triskellian initially. It didn't work, but her bravery was noted nonetheless.", "During the trip to West Triskellian, and before the army could annihilate the enemy Jadelanders, Virendra's gobby mouth and reckless moves got him killed. Did he really think setting his hands alight to fight a spider was useful? He nearly killed the Sheriff.", "As useful, and possibly funny, as it was at the time, Jasper really shouldn't have disrespected a corpse by throwing it at the oncoming Jadelanders to defend blows. At least he came out unharmed from that particular maneuver.", "He might be a gender-confused hyena, but it's not really something everyone needs to know, particularly before an impending siege upon the Jadelanders invading West Triskellian. At least Logan entertained the wolf Virendra before he died. Keeping his attention away from petty bickering was handy.", "Sir Twyrch was kind enough to lend Lord Valentinus one of his blades, having learned that he was without one until it arrives via courier.", "When the fisherwife wanted to hunt down her husband for spending all the wages he earned on whiskey, mister Jardskjalfti didn't give up the drunkard husband, but paid from his own pockets to ensure the wife and the five kids had enough money to live off.", "Even though the memorial service for Tamara was short notice, Lady Antonia still made a point to show. She had never even met the Baroness, so it was especially touching that she would go out of her way to show her support.", "Rufius met Tomoe and Valdus, asking for their aid in recovering the stolen silverware from the palace. Valdus was quite rude -- he couldn't show basic courtesy and just nuzzled against Tomoe and acted very uncaring. When Tomoe said she would keep an eye out, Valdus directly said he would not and used an excuse of being tired as to why. The man really need to learn proper manners and basic courtesy, and at the very least, be polite and apologize for poor behavior.", "Sir Bayard is rather presumptuous, thinking he knows the reasons why the Rinaldi are supporting Dame Xena overseeing the Sailors Guild. Not only this, which is a mistake all people can make, he threatens to take the law into his own hands if his delusions become true, ignoring the Constabulary, the law, and Rinaldi rule. To conclude the matter, he even questions Dame Xena's honor, a well-loved and well-respected Knight of the Rinaldi. Someone really needs to learn diplomacy if they're going to toss around insults and threats.", "Sir Bayard wrote a rather abrasive letter to Xena threatening the life of Alessa should she cross him, stating clearly that he wouldn't involve the law -- only his blade. He was also presumptuous in Xena's association making unsubtle assumptions that Xena's intentions were dishonorable. He should show more respect for Rinaldi law and Rinaldi Knights.", "Miss Soto aided Silver Butler Rufius greatly when she searched and found no less than ten missing silverware pieces and promptly returned them. Her name is praised amongst the Palace staff as a dedicated and trustworthy person in Docktown.", "Mister Adon aided Silver Butler Rufius more than could be expected when he searched and found six of the missive silverware pieces. He spent days trying to locate the silver, and several times sent in what he had found. His name is praised amongst the Palace staff as a dedicated and trustworthy servant to the Rinaldi.", "As a completely new citizen in Triskellian, mister Castle showed extraordinary loyalty to his new home by aiding Silver Butler Rufius in retrieving the lost silverware. Without much knowledge of the city, he took the time to search and found five of the missing items. As the law abiding person he is, he promptly returned his findings. Mister Castle's name is praised among the palace staff as a dedicated and trustworthy servant to the Rinaldi.", "In spite of his nature, mister Ilo decided to send in the silverware he found -- 8 pieces in all, worth quite a fortune. He is to be commended for going against his nature and following the path of honesty.", " Dame Xena showed exceptional bravery when she spoke up as the first person in the trail against Presbyter Ximen, thereby risking standing alone and unsupported in the accusations against the Inquisition and  risking becoming a target for them herself. A true knight with a brave heart, the Rinaldi can be proud of her.", " All right, all right, never mind that Dame Xena was eating skinks but her table manners when she was doing so! Disgusting!", "Despite personal disagreements and Dame Xena petitioning to get him  demoted within the Church, Deacon Ximen willingly volunteered to go on an  expedition to Paludestris to retrieve some enchanted scissors with which Dame Xena  could be freed from my curse of silence. He could have easily turned her away due to their history, but instead he showed mercy and kindness in a  time when she  most desperately needed it. I'm starting to believe there's much more humanity in him than people give him credit for.", "Good of Dame Xena to have the sense to give up her weapons when she knows her soul is in the clutches of an evil Necromancer.", "After Xena was cleansed of black magic, she was openly angry at Marcus for his desire to keep those tainted with black magic contained so they would not pose a threat to the city or be accused for murders that they may or may not have been involved in. Where's the love???", "Dame Xena aided in Lord Marcus's search for his wife Tamara and recovering her remains, and was a source of comfort for him. She's so loyal.", "Lord Marcus continued the search for his wife, even years after her disappearance so that he, his daughter, and the House could get some.", "Lady Antonia kept the house organized and as safe as possible when Dame Xena and Adon were taken by black magic curse and she had to real way of helping. She delegated takss, kept up on correspondences, consistently visited them in the infirmary to ensure they were being well taken care of, and continued to ensure the day to day business ran smoothly. Despite feeling she had failed in some way, she truly had more success during that trying time than she realizes.", "Sir Twyrch took it upon himself to lead a small group of Rinaldi to the arena and school them in various combat topics free of charge. He was good-natured about the entire ordeal, even lending a weapon to Lord Valentinus with which to spar.", " While sparring with a mixed group of people in the Docktown arena, he continuously made inappropriate remarks to Reeve Zanthia about how she could/should kiss him, how he enjoyed her touch when she was attempting to bandage him, etc. A new Noble to town should be more careful about what he says in public places and who he says it in front of, lest he reflect poorly upon his House and seem less than virtuous.", "After hearing about the black magic curse that afflicted her house members, she automatically took to finding a scholar-mage who could further investigate the true meaning behind what occurred to ensure the safety and reputation of the Rinaldi and their royalty. Truly, her mind is an astounding machine that looks at every angle of a situation and can easily come up with appropriate solutions. She is an undeniable asset to the embassy.", "Lord Matteo asked for a dusky lesson right in the middle of the commons. I know it's not that rare of a language to know anymore, but it's reserved typically for criminal sorts. You don't, as a noble, request that sort of information in the middle of a crowded place.", "Lord Matteo made a scene in the tea house because the Ambassador of the Rinaldi didn't permit him to suit Lady Grazia. He insulted his fellow Knight, Dame Xena, by stating she lacked discretion and that it was partially her fault he couldn't be with Grazia because she supposedly is accepting suitors, and then followingly insulted the Rinaldi Reeve, stating he was a snitch who would repeat any private conversations to his superior -- which he very well should, as it follows protocol. His demeanor is unbecoming his station, and his words are dangerously.", "Dame Xena did show extra-ordinary dedication when Silver Butler Rufius announced the missing silverware. Not only did the Dame spend her own personal time looking for lost items, she also utilized her resources to discover where the missing items were hidden, discovering that a citizen of Triskellian had kept several pieces for himself.", "Mister Fyros put himself in harm's way to lead a group into the sewers to deal with the spider infestation -- nearly losing his life in the process.", "Mister Rylen traveled along with the group heading into the sewers, unarmed no less, to assist in flooding out the mutant spiders into the bay. Brave or stupid .. I don't know, but someone apparently was impressed.", "Did you see that message the Sheriff wrote about the spiders? The one where the Sergeant was asking people not to go down into the sewers? Looks like she rather undermined him there -- I hope that people still get the message.", "Now while it may be all well and good Xena going down to the sewers, it's still a bit reckless of her, isn't it? That place was crawling with spiders and she took civilians. Not to mention possibly blundering through the work that other people had been doing down there.", "Biggs chided Xena for assisting a party of citizens down in the sewers to remove the spiders. He accused her of being the leader and initiator, which she wasn't, and then informed her he was disappointed in her for not writing to him first and letting him know what she was doing. Since when does a Noble have to report their activities to the Constabulary when the matter at hand isn't a legal one? And, furthermore, why is it now an insult to try and make the city a safer place and keep people (who might be too inexperienced for the task they're undertaking) out of harm's way? Someone needs to get their head out of their hiney.", "Dame Xena bravely took control of the sewers and helped arrange for them to be flooded to wash away the dangerous spiders. Just like a knight, to watch out for the common people, the defenseless and the weak.  Its what a Knight -should- be.", "Xena had the balls to not only speak the launguage of the street rats in the commons but also took it upon herself to teach others the bad habit too. Why would a knight show off such a skill?", " Asking for a slumhoodery lesson from another Noble in the middle of the commons. Really? At least Lady Anelie could have done it in private so as not to be somewhat insulting.", "Imagine a perfectly pleasant, lovely field. Flowers growing, bees a'buzzing, tranquil, and idyllic. Now imagine it ruined by that bat girl Achlys brawling all over it! Grrr .. there are arenas for just that sort of thing!", "Imagine a perfectly pleasant, lovely field. Flowers growing, bees a'buzzing, tranquil, and idyllic. Now imagine it ruined by that shrew Alfio brawling all over it! Grrr .. there are arenas for just that sort of thing!", "For a smart fellah, people are sayin' mister Iain is rather dumb. He was said to be standin' right in the commons insultin' every workin' man's way of life, as well as the tactics the Constables use to control criminals. He was heard sayin' we have a lamentable lack of specialization apart from boorish force. I'm not sure what that all means, but it sounds like he's callin' us all stupid. What's stupid is standin' in the middle of Docktown and sayin' so! He's liable to find some boorish force comin' at his nose if he ain't careful!", "As a director it's considered very bad practice to cut actors from a play and then not tell them. That's what Nan did, and left the poor chap to only find out when the show went up. Poor form!", "Even though Braxton is the son of both Lord Twyrch and Baroness Kenina, he has been seen entering the tailor shop filching on the clothing in the racks reserved for the poor and new. You'd think he was well provided for!", "The arrogance of some people! That Sang, especially. I hear he decided it was his right to break up a picnic and ruin several people's afternoons simply because they decided to have a friendly sparring match while enjoying their time in the meadow. He just walked right in like he owned the place, throwing objects and insults, demanding that everyone stop and concede to his always delusional whims. Just because he's some University so-and-so doesn't mean he's better than anyone else. Someone should tell him that! Oh wait .. I'm telling him that.", "It seems Lord Twyrch has done a wonderful job raising his son, Braxton, and that the boy is eager to follow in his father's diplomatic footsteps. Prelate Theressa called upon young Braxton to discuss concerns over the behavior of some of the Bisclavret craftsmen. She was very pleased with his handling of the situation, calling him prompt, efficient, diplomatic, and graceful.", "That boar Knight Sir Erwin doesn't know much about gratitude. A fellow boar tried to get him to go along to help out a failing village and he simply turned it down.", "Miss Aneira did a wonderful job in hosting the dinner party, and she made the Bisclavret house very proud.", "Whilst in the commons, mister Cullan was overheard forcing his opinion on a reluctant mister Giles on what is and isn't appropriate in terms of service to the Constabulary. He was speaking as a member of the militia, whose sole purpose is to take up arms against criminals, but that's not entirely what the Constabulary is about. As Giles was sticking up for himself, Cullan also decided to chide miss Odessa on waving about a naked blade despite that he was hypocritically carrying an exposed rapier himself. Get your facts straight, wolfie!", "I heard that Cullan was repeatedly insulting during a conversation he was having with mister Giles about the Constabulary, and when he was informed of this and requested to apologize, he proceeded instead to repeat the insult twice more, and threaten him! Either he's too stupid to follow a simple conversation, too arrogant to admit his mistakes, or he's an abusive brute.", "Lady Georgianna ran a small social and did so with grace, despite that someone faceplanted into a pie.", "Lady Georgianna wasted no time arranging a social upon her return to town. The turn out was great and the company enjoyable for such little planning.", "Mister Chinco kindly offered fresh, hand-picked strawberries to everyone in the commons. What a breath of fresh air!", "Fyros was rumored to be busily running in and out of the commons, rudely throwing scrolls at the poor, overworked courier, all while blatantly ignoring everyone else present even though he was greeted several times. Apparently busy mercenaries have no time to return pleasantries, and likely they're trained in poor manners. What a horrible trade skill.", "That bat, Achlys, sure can keep a cool head. She even managed to patch up Deacon Ximen -while- he was burning a heretic! Talk about skill .. woh.", "Don't make any arrangements with Doctor Hush. She takes loyal friends and discards them when they are no longer useful to her. She'll make vows and arrangements for instruction and payments, for willing service, and totally pretend they never happened and threaten to blacklist them for inquiring about the status of said arrangements. Next, she might send them a scroll, saying she doesn't even want any correspondence to discuss the situation like civilized people would, but will instead make threats via the courier that one simple query is cause for a blacklisting. Can a person become more hostile or arrogant and totally dismiss all discussion and arrangements previously agreed upon?", "That arrogant young Braxton started a scene with a loyal Bisclavret guardsman about nothing. Seems mister Viktor and young Pepper have known each other for years, and are basically siblings, but that didn't stop Braxton from berating him and insulting his honor, accusing him of gross misconduct and bringing shame to the House. He drummed Viktor right out of a job, right then and there! Little Pepper was only sitting on his shoulders, like she always does! I don't know if being the son of a Noble gives that entitled twerp authority over all of House Bisclavret, but he sure seems to think it does.", "People might not generally care, but Hush was in public, in the west commons, referring to people as twats in the crowd. Even though it's amusing, it's not very appropriate for a gentry member, is it?", "Did you hear that? Apparently Fyros lied straight to Achlys' face saying Hush said he was allowed to learn medic from her despite being outside the University guild. When Lys checked up with her boss this was in fact not true at all. Then he cussed Hush in the middle of the commons for calling him out! What a twat!", "Mister Fyros openly spoke out against Doctor Hush, a woman of rank that is held in high regard by most, if not all, of the city, and in the commons! He called her all sorts of horrid names and it was really mean and hateful. For shame, mister Fulke, for shame!", "Miss Nan took the time to not only write and direct a wonderful play for the city, but she included a valuable lesson in the script itself -- that every action has a consequence. In this case, we learned the valuable lesson that taking grains impairs one's judgement - sometimes fatally.", "Miss Nan wrote and organized a play which turned out to be a big success. You have to admire the dedication and hard work such an endeavor requires.", "When telling newcomers about his guild, mister Chesh freely advertises that he doesn't care whether the jobs he gets hired to do are legal or not, he's just happy to do them. For an indentured servant, he isn't very smart, is he?", "Lady Georgianna held a social get-together which everyone was invited to. There were fresh strawberries, drinks, chocolate, pie, and good company. She went out of her way to arrange for something to happen during a time when hardly anything has been happening at all. Even the room was decked out in pretty streamers, with everything in its place and a place for everything! She should be commended for attempting to provide regular socials that anyone can come and enjoy.", "Good on Nan for writing her own play, and what dedication too for finally managing to present it in the theatre form after three whole years of trying, waiting, and disappointment. She paid for all of the equipment, including furniture, clothing, and stage props. Congratulations for all your hard work paying off.", "Alfio volunteered to take part in Nan's play as the creepy, feminine spider. Despite his difficult and apparent inability to portray a female effectively, it all worked out to give the play a humorous edge. Well done!", "As one accustomed to being proper at all times, mister Kaine managed to let loose a little and dress up as a crate slash dewdrop slash Constable for Nan's play. He may have accidentally turned toward the exit whilst blinded beneath the box, but it all added to the light-heartedness of the theatre. Good work!", "Alma managed to conquer her stutter so that she could play a lead role in Nan's play, which shows just how much work she was willing to put towards a good and fun cause!", "Usually shy, Rylen did fantastic playing a feminine flower in Nan's play, Pink! He was a good sport wearing a dress which couldn't have been more fluttery and girlish if it tried.. Personally, I don't think I could have let loose as many tears on the stage in front of so many people if I tried! Good going, skunk boy.", "Looks like the Bisclavret Lady is slumming it in the commons yet again. Not only that, but with LePlow of all people. They've been spending quite a bit of time behind closed doors together.", "Kaine has served the Bisclavret with every breath in his body. Even when Lord Twyrch and his posse of fools came along and forced Kaine to take the position of Reeve, he handled it with nothing but grace and respect.", "Ambassador Kaine has handled the current change in power within the Bisclavret very well and has continued to represent his House with honor and integrity while those around squander their chance at making the House better. Good on him for being such a good sport and allowing those less capable a chance to try their hand at running things.", "Mister Adon got Baron Marcus' sister out of a foreign house before it blew up and to safety. He followed orders intelligently and without delay and did a good job. He's a handy fellow to have as your friend!", "Mister Adon silenced the man calling for Xena's death below deck when her ship was in a violent storm and he believed it was bad luck due to her being a woman. Adon opened his throat as a warning to other mutinous crew, and it worked beautifully. Murder isn't always the best option, especially without the Captain's permission, but treason and mutiny only have one sentence, and Adon wasn't shy in carrying it out.", "Without any provocation, Chesh instigated an argument between himself and Una, with Chinco supporting him in an attempt to gang up by bringing up the case against Sir Bayard for requesting someone bow to him in Newtown. Chesh called Una an 'ass kisser of Nobles' for siding with Sir Bayard on what is and isn't expected in Newtown, picking on her while she was conveniently present. When it came to apologizing to her as a serf, Chesh accused her of ass kissing again, only without the use of curse words, which didn't retract the insult whatsoever. Shame, shame.", "The good Doctor Rose was quite insistent about talking with Lady Georgianna about a private medical procedure in the middle of the Docktown commons, despite the Lady's request to discuss it at a later time. The Doctor even attempted to pressure her into getting the aforementioned procedure done, amidst the many inquisitive glances of the people loitering nearby. She should know better than to speak about such private matters so openly, especially when they concern the Nobility of the city.", "Rumor has it that Prelate Theressa wishes to promote Clover. Is she completely oblivious to the fact that he is a Lutaran?", "Gabrielle is hinting at using her newspaper as a weapon against the entire Great House of Bisclavret, after she was insulted by the Captain of the Guard, mister Cullan. Why not follow the socially acceptable course of action and request an honorable duel to defend the honor of the Avoirdupois? Where is her fiance in this to defend her personal honor? Or do the Horses no longer have any, and resort to media gossip to showcase their 'virtues'? If I were them, I would be utterly ashamed.", "Miss Olive took it upon herself to implore an individual to try and force a newcomer to eat his used food. Perhaps pointing the newly arrived to the fresh fruit by the docks which is free might have been a better idea?", "Mister Prezzle was said to have tried to force a half-eaten pancake into the mouth of a newcomer against her will.

Apparently the Doloreaux asked Brooks to clear up whether Rhea was asking people to blacklist the Doloreaux on behalf of the Avoirdupois or not.

Helpful, polite, answering proper questions and sticking to the protocol while doing so.  Such a good chap.", "That Geradan, always putting his personal feelings first.

It's a wonder she returned safely!", "Rumor says during the Avoirdupois mission to safe Lady Theressa, he was more interested in fishing up treasures from the see and wreck, than actually on the work he was tasked with.

How chivalrous and romantic, sailing off to rescue your true love! It's a rarity in men these days to act with such bravery when unknowing of what the result will be, or the state of their companion. It's nice to see that some values are maintained by Nobility, and that some still strive to set an example for those of lower station.  He's sooo dreamy!", "Have you heard about a chap by the name of Virendra?  Apparently he enjoys tricking people into eating and drinking food items he keeps in his codpiece.

The shame of it all.", "I heard a group of gentry talking about the Doloreaux and their servant Senora.

For all his behavioral problems, he didn't punch or stab anyone.  I was as surprised as you!", "Depending on who you ask, Miss Aysun did the majority of the organizing of the singles social and was a most gracious, organized hostess.  Also depending on who you ask, she wanted to throttle half the guests, but you didn't hear that from me.", "You know that singles social?  Well guess what?  A few people found her demeaning the social expectations in public and before commoners a bad example.  Apparently Sheriff Joshua was an instigator.  But who cares?  She's an aristocrat, she should know better!", "Despite instigating Esquire Lilandra to behave badly at the singles social, he at least hinted that perhaps being introduced by a third party would be more appropriate instead of just walking up to a stranger to talk.  Maybe he isn't such a worthless pile as many people think.", "Apparently the slave Ryan's fingers are made of steel.  He played his fiddle for so long... any other person's fingers would've fell off!  How very spirited of him.", "You know who Cork is?  Yeah.  You know who Sunta is?  Yeah.  Apparently he asked her to dance and she refused him!  Not that -I- blame her.  Probably crushed his poor little heart in the process.", "Like I've said before, Sunta didn't want to dance with Cork at the ball.  He's not a catch, but she could at least have been sociable enough to indulge him.  He might not have groped her in the process.", "Cork made a real effort to invite people to dance at the ball.  Even the ugly girls I'm told.  For being a bit on the... not-so-pleasant looking side himself, that's a winner in my book!", "Sang made a real effort to dance with everyone at the ball!  Especially the wallflowers.  He was charming and graceful and... almost womanly, come to think of it.  He's still aces to me though!", "Who invited Cork to that ball anyway?  I heard some gals chattering on about how he was leering at them in a most inappropriate fashion.  You'd think the organizers would have known better.", "Loki. A paragon of masculinity and military inclinations. He still danced at the ball! Who'd have thought he was capable? I was soooo surprised!", "That Rinaldi maid, Wynter, she's a real go getter!  Pulled the decorations for the ball together at the last minute!  And all by herself no less!  What a fantastic helper.", "Even if she did help with the last minute decorations at the social, Wynter also bailed out on getting the main foyer properly decorated once the tables were there.  For shame!  FOR!  SHAME!", "When you think of chivalrous gentlemen, you should think of Esquire Brooks.  He must have nearly worn his hooves off dancing with almost every woman who attended the recent ball.  I wonder where all of his stamina comes from, he's kind of scrawny.", "Did you hear that Viscountess Aedina played at the singles social?  How gracious of her.  And what's more, Xena made sure that everyone shut their pie holes so that she could be heard.  Now that's class!", "I heard some infirmary workers gossiping.  Doctor Jahren's a good chap, always helpful and in the infirmary.  Though that doesn't really excuse his showing up to a social without formal clothes, then blathering about how his assets were directed to better things.  What better things are there?  Cake?", "So apparently Jahren crashed a party, walking in with armloads of junk that he should have left somewhere else!  I guess someone though he was going to stab them with his scalpel.", "You heard?  I sure did.  Oh, what did I hear you ask?  Well... apparently Jahren crashed a party he wasn't formally invited to, not wearing something appropriate for the occasion and hauling around, what is rumored to be, all of his worldly possessions.  Invest in a trunk or something man!", "Lots of talk around town about Jahren.  He made quite the fuss at a recent social, coming uninvited, poorly dress and, and, and, bringing a guest who wasn't invited either!  And she was married!  And without her husband at her side!  FOR SHAME I tell you!", "Upstanding doctor, charitable man and apparently a party crasher too!  Oh Doctor Jahren, when will you learn?", "Despite her being demure and ladylike, I wouldn't want to ruin one of Esquire Aysun's parties.  Apparently she almost had some people kicked out of her last one!  Seriously, very scary.", "While she might not take kindly to people trying to ruin her social, at least she has the sense to not grab them by their collars and drag them out!  Aysun that is.  She did the right thing by hinting that the crashers weren't welcome instead.", "So Cork went to that fancy to do singles social, don't ask me why or how.  Apparently while dancing, he was rude to Esquire Brooks by not permitting him to cut in and dance with Cork's partner!  The gall of that man!  String him up by his neck I say!  I can't stand rudeness!", "Do you have any idea how much work goes into planning a social?  I was asking my brother's wife's sister's uncle's grandfather's third cousin about it.  And apparently that Aysun deserves a lot of respect for pulling it all together.", "Viscountess Aedina played for everyone at the ball, did you hear?  And her haunting voice accompanied her playing.  I talked to Lord So-and-So and he said he was one of the most enchanting performances he'd ever seen.", "I went to that ball the other night and I saw the slave Ryan.  He was well behaved, very surprisingly.  Whatever Hush is doing to keep him in line, it must be working.  Maybe she found something besides whips to beat him with.", "I'm almost sick of hearing about Aysun, that Bisclavret gentry.  But I'll tell you anyway, that she was most polite and not too generically nice to all the guests at the social.  If you ask those who attended.  Personally, I find her cold and aloof.  But my opinion doesn't count for much.", "Ever stopped to chat with that Cork guy?  Me either.  But if what I'm hearing about him is true, every last bit of his income goes to the church and the less fortunate!  Surely he'll be blessed by the Great Light for his charity.", "So I heard the other day, from some sailors who were passing by, that Doctor Jahren has been trying to boss around people he has no authority over.  Trying to make them do what he wants, even demeaning them in public!  Jealousy does not become you, my friend, you're a healer.  First do no harm!", "You probably don't need to hear about Clover's generosity, but just in case you do, he keeps flinging money at people to help them get started.  You gotta wonder... when is he going to run out of denarii?", "Faile went to a social, dressed up like a real woman and danced with some poor, unsuspecting fellow.  I snickered when I heard it too.  But at least she made an effort to fit into proper society.", "So Xena dressed Faile up for the recent social.  Fighting through the slaver's defenses must've been like trying to capture Chalon single-handed!  That Xena is so persuasive, though, I wonder how she gets everyone to do what she wants...", "I know she's a commoner.  And I know she's not that smart.  And I know about her reputation.  But still, what is Vajhira thinking, running through Docktown in nothing but her undergarments?  Even if she was swimming, in the middle of winter mind you... yeah, I laughed too, she still should have dressed herself again before wandering into the Severed Tail.", "Hahahahaha!  Listen to this!  Cork claimed that the lands of the Bisclavret, while impressive, are lacking in proper odor due to too many wolves being there.  Now I wonder what his homeland smells like, though I'm able to imagine seeing as he's a skunk and all.", "That Vajhira, she's just rude.  Doesn't bother to talk to anyone if she doesn't think she can take them up to... well, nevermind.  Still rude.", "I heard there was a lot of food left after the social, those nobles fill their bellies with more liquor than actual food, am I right?  Anyway, Esquire Aysun is apparently handing out the leftovers to anyone who wants some.  Generosity is to be smiled upon!", "Come here, let me tell you a story.  Sir Brumble sponsored Cork as a guest at the singles ball.  So what does Cork do?  He hassles the staff and servants for every bit of food he can get his hands on.  And not only does he not eat it, he stuffs it into his pouches and his shirt!  Maybe in the future, Sir Brumble will be more careful about who he invites next time.", "Noe is one of those Avoirdupois horses.  I hear she's so kind, she'll touch anyone's hair for free.  You wouldn't catch me touching most of the heads in Triskellian, that's for sure.", "So that Virendra, I think he's with the Sailor's guild, he's all about giving out free lessons in handling pain after he whacks people good in a spar.  Or elsewhere, depending who you ask.  I wonder how he goes about it... probably involves some things that are better left in private.", "Brooks'll tell ya, if you're at an event with peers, knights and gentry... even if you're a commoner, you don't dance cheek to cheek!  Nevernevernever!", "So I've been talking about being charitable a lot, haven't I?  Well Sir Althalus is downright charitable.  But it comes with a price.  Yon poor beggars in the streets and alleys might get a bit of coin off of him, sure, but you gotta listen to him go on and on and on about the Light and being concerned about the souls of other.  Crikey mate, they just need a hot meal, not a lecture.  But I'll admit, he's a good sort for bothering to give at all.", "The recent Single's Ball, lots of chatter about that.  I hear tell that it was originally the idea of Lord Marcus and Viscountess Kenina.  But they were just too lazy to figure everything out.  So they got Aysun to do it!  Good thing to, because she did a bang up job and is so modest about her role in the whole thing.  Gentry, who'd a thunk it?", "Senora is, I hear, one of the most senior Doloreaux commoners.  Served since forever and really loyal too.  And it's no wonder, she goes around hugging the boars like they're her best gal pals!  I don't know about you, but that's not something I'd expect to see out of a serious reeve-clerk-high up- position thingy like her.", "That Lucinda!  You haven't heard?  Apparently she's walk right up and lay one on whoever is standing around in the commons.  Depending on who you ask.  I know a few blokes who wouldn't mind meeting a gal like her.", "That Cork!  You haven't heard?  Apparently he'll walk right up and lay one on whoever is standing around in the commons.  Depending on who you ask.  I know a few gals who wouldn't mind meeting a bloke like him.", "Cork's a dirty, mongrel, yuck yuck yucky sort of guy.  But he carries S'allumer in his heart and wishes people the Light's blessing.  So I guess that counts for something.", "Geradan's really trying to get himself right in the eyes of the church.  But he still swore at service!  Right there in front of the Light and everyone!", "So I was talking to one of my chums the other day, and he was telling me about this gal Polgara.  I don't know if she's married to this bloke or anything, but she went right into a room of the boarding house with a man fitting Khagra's description!  And to top it all off, she was dressed like she was going to whip him!  Leather head-to-toe, hand to the Light!  Of course if he is her husband, ignore whatever I'm saying.", "You know Red?  Or Rhea?  Yeah, that's the one.  I done heard that she was jawing in the commons about finding a pretty girl for some fella.  Right there in front of everybody!  If you ask me, she should stick to keeping her thoughts to herself.", "Jarek's a downright fool if you ask me!  He's too open about his trying to woo women, never you mind the fact that he inspects them in a closer than proper way.  And I'm not just talking about their faces and personalities!", "That Chinco.  What a hoot.  Apparently he got sprayed by a skunk named Cork, completely by accident!  But that didn't stop Chinco by gum, he turned right around broke that bloke's nose.  It's the most I'd seen him say or do in... well, since the last time he hurt someone!", "Heard about Kolgrim?  Didn't think so.  I thought that he was a right respectable sort of scholar type.  But turns out, he's nothing but a scoundrel.  Drunkenly staggering around town, he openly told his current love interest, in public no less, that he cheats on her.  For shame!  How low can a man be to treat a poor woman like that?", "Bishop Basanti always gives the most lovely sermons.  But at her last one she mentioned to a crowd of nobles, gentry and commoners that she spends her days laying around in her pajamas eating cake!  That's not what you'd expect from someone preaching the Light's lessons, is it?  For shame!", "There's this gal who comes around every now and again by the name of Celia.  According to my best friend's doctor's barber's midwife's carpenter, she went ahead and slapped Virendra when he touched her behind!  That girl has spunk!", "Oh the antics of Docktown!  Listen to this here: Virendra went ahead and touched Celia's derriere, so she slapped him right across the face!  The catch?  He slapped her right back!  The nerve!  One of the constables was going to file charges against them both for minor assault until Sir Althalus stepped in.  He demanded that Virendra apologize, which he did.  A happy ending all around, wouldn't you say?  That Althalus has a good head on his shoulders.", "Lianaar's a kind and generous soul... depending on who you ask.  A new gentry woman had arrived in Triskellian and Lianaar offered to pay for clothing for the gentry out of her own pocket.  In a very discreet way as to not make the new miss seem embarrassed.  It's the sort of thing to make you think there's still hope that the Light's lessons are being taking ot heart.", "I heard some girls gossiping over at the Turret today, and they say that if you ask anyone, Sir Bayard is a true gentleman who carries himself just as a knight should. Polite, generous and helpful, he is an exemplar of chivalry and good decorum.", "That Senora certainly knows how to welcome new members of her House to Triskellian.  That is how you make a House grow.", "Bruno's a busy sort of guy, no doubt, and everyone is clambering for his attention.  I guess scrolls are too hard to write these days.  Anyway, he was talking to a client in the commons the other day and someone just kept interrupting him.  Wouldn't shut their mouth for love nor money.  But old Bruno, he suggested a new conversation should be continued only after his current discussion was complete.  Put them in their place, Bruno.", "I'm sure everyone knows just how big Virendra's mouth is.  It's no secret.  But when you go around interrupting the conversations of simple craftsmen, and I mean simple, it's bound to confuse the poor guy.  While the enthusiasm is flattering it's still rude.  Where have manners gone?  Out the window, that's where!", "I hear that Jahren, good man that he is or appears to be, has a tendency of first making sure he lands safely in a good place, before jumping from his current position.  But he always fails to ask about release from oaths.  It's no wonder bridges are burnt and some people consider him unreliable.  Oath breakers are not to be trusted.", "Not only did Jahren come uninvited to the single's social, but he brought the wife of someone else with him as company.  What a scandal!  Who brings a married woman to an event for singles?!  Seriously?!  I have no idea!", "You want to hear a dirty little secret?  I knew you did, come closer.  Apparently Jahren engages in blasphemous romantic adventures.  The biggest scandal being word getting around about it.  I always say, if you can't trust them, don't lay with them.  But that's just me.", "Instead of being understanding and explaining the right and wrongs of behavior in Triskellian, I heard that Hush snapped quite viciously at a newcomer who did not yet understand the rules of a big city.  Honestly?  Where is the understanding?", "I know I've said lots of bad things about that slave, Ryan.  Yeah he probably needs to be shot, stabbed or hung.  But when it comes to newcomers, he's pretty understanding.  Especially when commoners aren't.  Have the commoners' minds rotted with a feeling of superiority?  Don't they remember that we all started somewhere?  For shame, commoners, for shame.", "My mammy always told me, if there's a preacher preaching, you'd better look like you ain't sleeping.  Or else your soul will be condemned to the fiery pits of wherever.  But Edd, bless his heart, he doesn't mind taking a nap in the pews.  I hope Ximen doesn't catch him next time.", "I've got another funny about Eddy.  Apparently he was at service in the chapel, and he made some lewd comments.  Boy what I would give to be able to see the look on the ladies' faces.", "Not only does Eddy make lewd comments during sermons, but they're just raunchy enough to make women blush.  Outrageous!  Or stupendous, depending on your point of view.", "I feel for the Sheriff, I do.  It's hard to find good men to serve him.  But it doesn't excuse his man Loki from ignoring all forms of social etiquette and insulting men of good birth everywhere.  I have it on good authority that the dog in question said, \\"I won't bow down to you due to your good breeding, nor give in to your petty demands.\\"  Tisk tisk.  Not something someone should be saying to a member of the gentry.", "Aeryn is someone who is sensitive to decorum and privacy.  Why I hear tell that she led a group of people away from another group of people, so they could speak privately on a sensitive issue.  How polite and helpful.", "That Meepers!  Another helpful seamstress of the city!  Giving free garments to those who are in need.  Her heart overflows with kindness!", "Sergeant Danae is a longstanding member of the Constabulary.  But y'know... there's something about a constable who has been charged for assault that makes me think she might not be the right person for the job.  But you didn't hear that from me, I don't want her knocking down my door and beating me too.", "That Rhea.  She's a hotheaded woman.  Apparently she doesn't care what she says to who, insulting higher ranking people than herself right to their faces!  Oh the shame of it all.", "Apparently Noire's a stand up kind of girl.  Defending Cerridwyn when she was in need.  Don't ask me how or why, I just repeat what I'm told.  Maybe she'll smarten up enough to get rid of that purple fur.  Eyuck!", "I like Hush, I really do.  She gave my uncle some nasty syrup to clear up his sinuses.  But honestly.  Gossiping about nobles and Cerridwyn with the likes of Rhea?  She should really know better than that.", "That Rhea, always spouting off when she shouldn't.  I hear tell she was insulting Cerridwyn in the commons, making fun of her by saying she's a \\"lord of a bunch of commoners\\" and generally taunting her in a nasty tone, all because the gentry might have suggested that maybe her clothes weren't exactly proper.", "What is there to say about Cullan?  Well he's a high-ranking commoner with the Bisclavret.  But that won't stop him from ignoring all propriety and leaping to the defense of a vulgar fox like Rhea!  And not only that, but he didn't try to quell her tongue, he egged her on!  Encouraging her to harass a member of the gentry even more!  Not what one would expect from a squire.  Not at all.", "All I see Jahren do is run off to private rooms with women. Specifically, Vajhira, and as far as I know she's courting another man. He seems to be doing that a lot lately, and I think it's a little soon after getting out of a relationship, not to mention his antics at the social.", "I heard that Tomoe was going to join the church when she came to Triskellian.  Instead she laid with a random man not seven days after she'd arrived.  Maybe it's better that she isn't tending to S'allumer's flock.", "Danae.  What is there to say?  I should hope that not all constables has such thin skin that they would fly into a rage and bea- their friends over a simple misunderstanding and hurt feelings. The mere idea that an individual like that would be allowed within the Constabulary is absolutely disgusting and.", "Apparently Cullan likes to suggest to women that she aught chase off the other 'horses'.  Which strikes me as odd and silly.  You'd think that an established commoner and a squire wouldn't make that kind of suggestion.  Or something.  For shame!", "That slave Ryan.  I know a lot of people don't have anything good to say about him, but I hear that he risked his life and nearly died to defend his owner, who was being attacked over an argument.  Now if that is not a good slave, I don't know what is.", "So apparently a man named Dodger actually tried to pickpocket Sir Althalus.  It was even after the knight asked him for a favor and gave him two denarii to do it!  Or so they tell me.", "A man named Chesh apparently spit in three faces that we know of, including Katrina's!  And he punched a girl in the stomach!  Oh Light!  What will we do?!", "So this gal named Fergie was seen just wandering around wearing wings!  In public!  Can you believe that?  The last person with wings was Dio, and we all know how that ended.", "Apparently Tomoe has a strong will and lots of forgiveness.  Huzzah and such.", "That Ryan!  Apparently Noe was sick with something awful and he went above and beyond while taking care of her.  That's a good slave, someone get him a treat.", "Apparently Thukal's a good guy for helping Noe while she was sick.  Yay for good guys!", "Virendra!  Will it never end?!  He was soooooo disrespectful to a ranking member of the Avoirdupois House.  Just like always!  Someone should hurt him badly to teach him a lesson.", "So apparently, if what my brother said is true, Virendra insulted Noe by implying that she was a lazy good-for-nothing with a sore arse from sitting around.  Maybe there's a little nugget of truth in there, but shock and horror that he would actually say so to her!", "I heard that Ayra walked into the lounge of the boarding house with naught a scrap of cloth covering her body.  Some people are very oblivious.", "I heard through the grapevine that Izzy is shacking up with Jahren.  And they aren't even married!  You'd think she would have learned her lesson, since last time he slept with her he left her for another woman.", "So my mate was standing in the commons the other day listening to people chattering.  He tells me that Rhea and Jarek were up to no good.  She goaded him onto stabbing a newcomer with the promise of showing Jarek her 'num-nums', whatever those are.  And he did it.  Can you believe that?", "That Jarek's turning into wild beast!  Apparently he ran right up to someone and stabbed him for no reason whatsoever!", "Apparently Rhea has taken to defending the Avoirdupois for some reason.  Defend them from what?  I don't know.  But it sure seemed important when people were gossiping around the putrid well.", "Mufasa's a dirty boy!  Apparently he was seen entering the PRIVATE quarters of a MARRIED woman wearing a scandalously skimpy loincloth.  Is there no such thing as propriety in this day and age?", "In other scandalous gossip, Lidia was seen leading a scantily-clad man into her private chambers.  To \\"fit an armband.\\"  I'm sure that's not the only thing they were fitting.", "People have been boasting about how Sir Edmond sets a fine example for all of his subordinates through his courtship mannerisms, his values, and his behavior.", "The Sheriff is such a wonderful man, and he provides a great service to this city - namely protection. Rumor has it he has tightened his grip on his guards and is beginning to ensure they treat everyone with the respect and courtesy they deserve.", "I hear Sattar isn't shy about sharing the details of mating with his wife, as well as claiming publicly that he lays with two women at a time.", "Did you hear that Sir Althalus is incapable of following dueling protocol? He has the audacity to speak to those he challenges before the situation is appropriately handled, even mocking them where witnesses are available.", "You hear Sattar got arrested?  Yeah, and get this, he said to the arresting constable, \\"Tell me what the most expedient option is so that I might return to making love to my wife.\\"  How uncouth for a gentleman.", "Deputy Loki displayed some kindness and took care of the slave Ryan while Gentleman Brooks was out of town. Ain't that a sweet way to try and make ammends with someone?", "Apparently, depending on who you ask, Hush is a great aid to the Doloreaux.  Don't ask me what that means.", "Big surprise .. word on the street is that Brenner doesn't trust his own housemates, or his betters.", "Apparently Joshua's in the habit of insulting the companions of criminals.  Who'd have thunk it?", "That Brenner! Hes been going around insulting Squires again. Oh, the shame!", "Unsurprisingly, Gentleman Brooks is being a gentleman, and escorting his peers and those of a genteel nature out of less than savory situations. Hooray for decency!", "Sattar being rude.  Who would've guessed?  Apparently Joshua politely remind him to submit his testimony to the magistrate and he was rude.  And his companions growled at Joshua!  And he didn't correct them!  And he didn't bow when he left!  Will those durn foreigners ever learn?", "The absolute outrage! Former Capitaine Brenner is reported to have asked a Knight for a public apology after being called a coward.", "If you need to spill the beans to someone who's tight-lipped, Chesh is your man!", "If you wanna get paid well, go talk to that Leplow fellow. Oh, and while you're at it, ask him for some tips on wooing the ladies -- it's his specialty!", "Slam! That's the noise you'll hear if you try to follow Rhea up to he room when she's busy with another man. Then you're picking up your bruised ego and prying splinters from your face just for trying to be helpful.", "Some men just can't control their women - case in point, Jarek. He even allowed Rhea to slam the door in the face of a ranked Avoirdupois member.", "It seems Brenner takes offense at everything his now ex-love, Noe, has to say. Breaking up is so very hard to do.", "I'll tell you who's said to be a fine gentleman - Captain Carlon. He doesn't have any problem telling people to shut their inappropriate traps in front of women, and he's stoic to boot!", "In need of licks and tuggings? Find Mistress Meepers in any public location and collect your share today! For being an armigerous gentry, she sure is awful friendly. It must be that whole cat thing.", "You know what Rosabelle said about you?  You're stupid.  Keep that in mind, stupid.", "Newcomers are boasting about Noe's generosity! Need some free garments? You know who to ask now!", "I heard that after a moment of impulse where Aeryn spoke candidly in argument against Theressa, she realized her wrong and apologized earnestly and heartfeltly for the transgression.", "I hear Chesh wants to be a murderer! He cursed at and threatened to kill people in a public area. Well, if you want to be a killer, the first thing you should do is not advertise it. Now everyone is watching him.", "I hear tell that Theressa doesn't control her slave, regardless of whose company he's in or how rude he's being.  For shame.  You'd think a noble would want a slave that behaves well.", "Marcel's a baaad slave.  He likes to fiddle with scissors and do his hair in a food place (very unsanitary), in front of nobles.  And then he snaps at any other slave who tries to correct his behavior!  And -then- his mistress blames the other slave!  Say what?", "Marcel's a super baaad slave.  He likes to fiddle with scissors and do his hair in a food place (very unsanitary), in front of nobles.  Who does that when nobles are eating?  Honestly!", "Someone had a busy few hours! Want to see what a Chesh schedule looks like? O dark hundred: verbally abuse a woman. O dark fifteen: Flare the anger and cause a public scene which turns chaotic and invites a whipping and sword injuries to oneself. O dark thirty: Spit on a ranked woman. O dark fourty five: Hit a woman new to town, just to get the point across! And O Light Nine Hundred and Eleven: Disrespect a Knight, to end the day on a high note!", "Sattar's a man who sports a title and he can't be bothered to bow to a lord.  Unbelievable!", "Rhea gives free booty to any man who's willing to fight for her. Spread the word! .. Or don't.", "Doctor Hush may be strict when it comes to stealing, but she has no problem giving out her services and goods for free to anyone who looks poor.", "Not only was Sattar disrespectful enough to not bow to Lord Edmond, he made a verbal threat that Edmond would regret taking any legal action against him.", "It seems Squire Cerridwyn needs to pay attention to conversations around her, and properly acknowledge people with their titles if she wants to flaunt her Sun Duke courtesy.", "I hear tell that Sattar never bows to Avoirdupois nobility.  Because his mother died.  That's a good reason.", "Oh, the scandal! The Avo Handmaid Nan was banging chimney brushes with the chimney sweep Eddy in the commons. I heard they even wielded shoes! Who uses shoes, honestly?", "Unbelievable! A chimney sweep reducing a Handmaid to banging chimney brushes with him in the commons. Where has all the good influence in the world gone?", "People think Eddy is annoying, and he doesn't know who they are. Neener neener.", "So I hear that Sattar was being disrespectful to Lord Edmond and even while they were discussing how rude he was last time.  And lo, Shaharazad, Sattar's wife, stepped closer to him, clearly backing him up and not even trying to remind him to be polite.  Some women, huh?  Can't live with them, can't trample them with a destrier.", "They say that Sattar has long had problems with the Avoirdupois, go so far as to threaten Aeryn's fiance, Mathias, when he first arrived.", "It seems that Sir Bayard didn't learn how to be inclusive in Knight School. He recently sent away a slave from a house meeting when the slave was there on behalf of a ranked house member. These sort of reasonless dismissals merely show he is capable of nothing more than repetitious solecisms.", "Who likse to spit?! Chesh does, Chesh does! The Doloreaux don't find it nearly as exciting though, especially not their gentry.", "Some people, and by that I mean Cersei, like to imagine Bayard humping balconies. I, for one, am not appreciative of the visual.", "Nobody likes an intoxicated horse! Captain Brenner recently became privvy to this knowledge, and hopefully will be thinking twice about lushing in public and in Noble presences again.", "Doesn't Sattar show common courtesy to anyone?!  His waist doesn't appear to work!", "What can this poor horse do right? I'm exhausted just reciting his list of transgressions! To summarize, people are spreading the word that Brenner is generally disobedient, an on-the-job alcoholic, and a bad representation of equines everywhere. I'd be a lush too if people talked about me like that.", "Not only doesn't Sattar bow to nobles, he can't be bothered to use the correct form of address.  Just ask Edmond and the other Avoirdupois!", "Need math lessons? Find Nan! Need good clothes at a price that doesnt make the seamstress any money? Find Nan! No .. seriously, she's gaining a reputation of being a businesswoman.", "If you ask around, you'll hear that Ayra is patient with absent-mindedness.  Pretty great, huh?  Yeah, I thought so too.", "Apparently Sir Bayard doesn't trust his own house's gentry members, tossing out Esquire Brooks' slave from a meeting for having a supposed 'loose' tongue. It's absolutely outrageous that the Knight be so excluding and so incapable of comprehending a servant attend in the stead of a master when it is necessary. Really! The nerve of some of these Nobles!", "He hasn't been back in Triskellian long and Sattar is already -demanding- that he get paid by the Bisclavret.  And what's worse, he couldn't even bother to properly address his scroll to Viscountess Aedina and kindly request it.  No, all he has are demands.  Perhaps he should return to Peres.  Perhaps then all his demands will be met.  Or perhaps he should demand his way to the bottom of Auvrich Bay.", "Need some lessons in courtly love? Esquire Cerridwyn is your girl! She can teach you everything you need to know about wooing the perfect woman. Satisfaction guaranteed.", "A true gentleman never leaves a woman in an unsavory situation. Esquire Brooks is such a gentleman.", "Mari, Mari, havent you heard? Fooker is a naughty word!", "We've got a groper on .. in .. around our hands! That's right! I heard mister Styre insists on taking whatever liberties he likes with miss Elizabeth, and he don't give a hoot or patoot who it's in front of either. A gentleman was talking to him just the other day about this very thig, but he was occupied, he didn't even notice. Too bad everyone else noticed. Maybe they're just jealous .. or maybe it's not too late to learn the lesson of keeping your hands to yourself. Wait! Don't misconstrue those words.", "Word on the street is Elizabeth isn't married. If she isn't married, she shouldn't be letting men grope her in the commons. If she wasn't letting men grope her in the commons, I wouldn't be gossiping to you right now. Naughty girl!", "Sattar's got a history of being not-so-nice if you ask the Bisclavret.  Disrespecting and threatening a ranking member of the Avoirdupois is recent, but he has always disrespected his own House with his revolting actions.  For supposed gentry, he is completely lacking in the department of manners, discipline and proper education.  But you didn't hear that from me.  Seriously.  I don't need him coming after me next.", "I hear Handmaiden Aysun presented herself most capably at the recent Noble meeting. Yay for blending in with snoots and suits!", "How could someone as thoughtful as Sir Brumble forget to mention the Light, or anything religious whatsoever, in his toast to the city? They say it made him come across as a self-serving Noble, only interested in trade and wealth, not of spiritual purity and holiness. Let us bow our heads and say a few words for him, that he might remember who and what blessed him with his station to begin with.", "They say Lady Grazia is just brimming with faith, and that she warmly shares that faith with any who are in need. Ain't that just sweet?", "Sir Althalus was being praised in the streets for his recent meeting of Nobles to discuss the comet threat. Ain't it great to be a go-getter?", "Apparently Esquire Brooks is more interested in running away from celestial threats than staying to fight them. Can't say I blame him, really. What are you gonna do if a comet comes crashing down on you?", "Praise those who are strong in faith; Esquire Cerridwyn be one of them!", "Apparently it's bad to be afraid in Church anymore. If a comet is coming, don't go to the church and share your fear there, do it on the streets instead. Oh, and definitely don't share your fears with women. They always overdramatize situations.", "It is truly unfortunate when a gentrywoman like Mistress Meepers cannot recall the order of rank in a ceremony. She helped herself to trailing Lady Grazia during a church meeting, ousting Dame Valara from her rightful place in line. When informed of her error, she simply continued on, ignoring the impropriety in entirety.", "As a member of the religious community, Presbyter Ximen renewed the community's faith in himself by offering support to the city during the meteor shower. It's so nice to have someone to learn on in hard times.", "How wonderful it is to have a Bishop like Basanti around in troubling times to open the doors of the church and provide sermons and support for the community.", "Sir Althalus is a sharp one! He has no problem recognizing opportunities for his house to increse their power, and doesn't think twice about informing anyone on how to take the appropriate steps. Now that's a Noble!", "That Esquire Cerridwyn sure can be mean! I heard she went into the commons and just began insulting random people without having any knowledge about their ranks or positions! What's worse, she continued after being told not everyone in the room was a commoner. It just goes to show you that even ranked people can be daft at times.", "No big surprise here. Word is spreading that Chinco likes to mock the houses, and believes them all to be useless. If you didn't already know that about him, then you really need to get out more.", "I heard that Hush and Marcel had a run in at some point.  Even with Theressa, Marcel's owner, standing right there.  The slave was rude to say the least, but Hush, she kept her cool, despite the fact that the noblewoman accepted her slave's behavior.", "Tomoe doesn't seem to know the difference between a gentleman, a slave, and a commoner. Even when it was explained to her, she decided to use the term gentleman freely, calling everyone by that title whether they were worthy or not. Giving slaves such esteem is not in the least bit appropriate, and demeaning the title for those who are true gentleman is even worse.", "Marcel's not a good slave.  That's nothing new.  But that doesn't mean that he had to glare at Hush when she was speaking politely to him.  Doesn't anybody know how to whip a slave anymore?  I'd do it for free if anybody asked me to.", "I hear Alexander prefers to prance about in near nakedness. Loincloths might be fashionable in other parts of the world, but in Triskellian clothes are appreciated, if not necessary. Hang up that rag and get yourself some britches, boy!", "Brie's just so engergetic and helpful to everyone!  And she's never afraid to lick things.  Just ask her to, she'll do it!  Honest!", "Chesh nods so much his head is bound to fall off in the near future. Mix it up, will you? Especially when different ranking people walk through the room. Nodding is just so primitive and rude.", "My ears are buzzing lately with talk of this Chesh fellow. Not only is he rude in general, but when given a chance to remedy his mistakes he responds with remarks like 'Whatever', and then simply exits the area. Here's a hint: If someone gives you the opportunity to apologize, take it.", "Brenner likes to drink on the job nowadays and then he has the gall to insult everyone around him to make himself look bad.  Maybe that flogging is overdue.  Or maybe the bartender needs to know when to stop sliding the ale over the counter.", "The small things apparently don't go unnoticed these days. Noe carries around a handy dandy umbrella, did you know? Well, now you do! Next time a comet comes plummeting toward the earth, she might share it with you also. She's generous like that.", "Depend on who you ask, Cullan's handsome and considerate.  Oh, and he deserves to marry more than just a carpenter for a wife.  I wonder which Cullan they're talking about.  Not the one I know, that's for sure.  Ask him about his sword collection.", "Oh dear, I heard some people weren't appreciative of Nan's verbal rodent abilities and her public display of them. Try to keep them more private, huh? We don't want crotchety people getting the wrong idea.", "Did you know Nan's a handmaiden?  Did you know that she helped Grazia as if she were a handmaiden?  Well now you do.  Come back again and I'll spout more useless information.", "Shame on mister Zeiss, back to his old habits. I hear this time he was trying to kiss on a bunny in the commons, and when she called him a dirty old man, he retorted that she said something altogether different the night before. That kind of talk is just far too nauseating for the general public. I know, because I have to hear about it, and hearing it second-hand isn't any better.", "Polgara's a quick learner.  And a good apprentice.  Listen to the words that are coming out of my mouth.", "I hear Izzy slapped Zeiss a good one across the face for being rude, but then started blathering about who she was sleeping with right in the commons like nobody else was listening. Really, there's a time and a place for that, even in Docktown.", "So rich, so pretty, best set of hooves in the whole darn city.  That's not the best set of things she's got, either.", "Flynn's going around saying Noe of the Avoirdupois is plagued with disease. I heard he was especially cruel to her in the commons. Give the lasses a break, Admiral! They can't all be sailors.", "You know that Khagra fellow? He's with Polgara, aye? Well, I heard he's cooking up a scheme with another lass to cheat on Polgara, impregnate the new girl and get her lactacting so she can feed his adopted son. If that's not someone with big issues, I don't know what is.", "Lots of people like Nan, but lots of people don't like that she leaves important conversations without permission from the Nobles in attendance. She needs to remember to do that.", "Apparently Cullan needs his eyes checked.  Or all bats look alike.  Either way, he mistook some bat for another bat and wouldn't apologize or something.  Then he spoke rudely and stormed off.  Adult-like behavior to be sure.", "Nan wasn't very nice, and I hear she talked really poorly about someone with a drinking problem, shaming him to the point of embarrassment. Remember that compassion and understanding are part of the Great Light's teachings. Kumbaya and stuff.", "That Squire Cullan sure has some brass balls. I hear he slandered the Marquise Alessandro -and- the Don himself about their handling of Constabulary issues. Can you imagine belonging to another house in a Rinaldi city and talking down about their royalty? Witnesses say he was eager for the parties to hear of his displeasure, and so the word is spreading. I'd be peeing my pants right now if I was him.", "Cullan's prone to arguing.  He's also prone to be wrong.  A lot.  But that won't stop him from rolling his eyes and offering a false apology.  I guess if you're wrong enough, you get used to it.", "I heard Dazrene allowed a slave to kiss her hand, even though he did it without asking her first. She's married, and she didn't even make a fuss. I wonder where slave lips have been..", "The smith Tark was seen entering the bedroom of miss Star, and without a chaperone. They aren't even married!", "I heard miss Star let mister Tark into her bedroom with no chaperone, and they aren't even married!", "Rhea was going on and on about how Madalina's pregnant and she's going to go crazy.  She says Virendra should run far away from her and leave her in the care of the church.  That fox might not be wrong.  Once my wife became the size of a dray, I prayed for lightning to strike me down daily.", "The slave Ryan went to offer chaperone to miss Star, who had mister Tark in her bedroom, and she turned him away saying she wanted sex with the smith, and didn't care about her virtue. It's a good thing she doesn't care, because now everybody knows!", "They say Althalus can fight, by the Light!  But can he dance?  Can he stand on one foot?  Can he rub his stomach and pat his head at the same time?  Can he touch his nose with his tongue?  Can he lick his elbow?  These are the important questions.", "Nan is cheer and chipper!  And more importantly, she's giving away free stuff!  Quick!  Quick!  Get it while you can!", "I hear the slave Ryan went and knocked on miss Star's bedroom door, where mister Tark was, and offered to chaperone, trying to explain the implications of two single people of the opposite sex being in a room together, and the smith actually threatened the slave and tried to shoo him off in an effort to deflower the girl before she understood what she was doing. Alas, we can be pretty sure those petals have been plucked.", "Sang's a helpful sort.  Advising newcomers on what would best help further their careers and passions... now if only he'd do something about the tongue.", "They say Cullan likes to get chatty and intrusive when you try to work with hot metal on a man's arm. If you're a master jeweler, I'd stay clear of that one.", "Sattar better start learning to bow to his bettes rather than nodding, or they're going to start plotting about that pretty little neck of his hanging on their walls.", "Wynter's a good, charitable sort.  She does hair for free.  Very generous.  Pass it on.", "Everyone likes a paying customer! If you want to make things for people who actually have money, go look for Doctor Hush. She has good taste and knows how to handle her bills in a timely fashion.", "Mari's the best miner in Triskellian.  Nobody better.  Nevermind that she's not allowed to carry weapons, wear armor, or learn from her guild's instructors.  Yep.  Upstanding, best miner.", "Dazrene needs to be careful who she slights.  Like that has ever stopped her before.", "Some people are just plain old crazy. Virendra was reported to have rubbed grease all over his body before sliding across the cafe and into the wall where he proceeded to write something akin to 'Virendra was here and did dirty naughty things in this cafe'. Isn't it just a teensy bit frightening that this is a guild council member?", "Clover's a generous businessman.  He takes good care of those really loyal to him.  Don't ask about the disloyal ones.  I SAID DON'T ASK!", "Izzy, darling, sugar, pudding pie! Don't be such a hussy in public with the men who have your attention! It's unbecoming, lady or not.", "Jahren, doctor, bunny, fluffnuts! Don't be so detailed in public conversation with the women who have your attention, especially if you aren't married! It's unbecoming of a supposed professional.", "They say that Eldro is the perfect slave if you're into manners, politeness, and obedience. Are you in the market for a slave? He might be the one for you!", "As a medical professional, you'd think Doctor Jahren would check in on the people he promises to look after. He didn't do that with some of them. It's a wonder they got better on their own at all!", "I hear Lidia sometimes gives out free clothes to new people. Swarm!", "I heard Zev likes to bounce around with only his loins covered. That might work in Phelan territories, but here in Triskellian people prefer fashion and bulk. No, not that kind of bulk.", "Althalus is into romantic ideals.  He said if he wore his iron plate to a combat, he'd win a boon from a Rinaldi lady.  Swoon much.", "Virendra sure is getting a reputation for being mean! They say just reently he started an argument with a newcomer and potential customer for no good reason. I guess the Sailor's Guild isn't having such smooth sailing anymore.", "Grazia was going to marry Matteo for the good of her House.  That's gotta take some guts.  It could've been worse, I guess.  She could've been stuck with Eberhard.", "While Marcel is said to have been bred as a slave, he sure didnt have the arrogance or callousness bred out of him. Most everyone agrees that he is just about the most unhelpful, snooty, and self-serving servant ever to scrub the Triskellian trash cans.", "Sang's a good fellow, usually.  But a Doloreaux knight asked him to do something and he got caught up in his own self-center wishes.  Didn't do what was requested.  Typical artsy type.", "Brenner needs to really take a look at his interactions with women. You don't yell at them, man! They always get revenge, and it's always worse than you can possibly expect.", "Sang's not prone to paying attention to people who offer him help.  Apparently.  Slap him for me next time you see him.", "Sang swears in public sometimes.  And in front of faithful Penitents of S'allumer.  Tisk tisk, Sang.  You should know better than that.", "Sattar may carry the title gentleman, but a true gentleman would never threaten a Noble. With all the trash talk I hear about him, I wonder how he hasn't yet fallen prey to the dagger of an assassin, or the bullet of a sniper. One thing's for sure, he needs to start treading more carefully.", "Apparently Sir Edmond is anal-retentive about proper acknowledgement. How dare a Knight expect people to bow to him! Such incredulousness!", "Some people are just too sensitive.  Rosabelle is one of those people.  Bugger is not a four letter word.", "Shouting and scream in the commons like a child is pretty common fare.  Especially for Mari.  But telling people to leave her alone and stop making fun of her because they were trying to help understand what she was saying?  Maybe if you took the mush out of your mouth, Mari, you wouldn't have these problems.", "Regrettably, I heard tale that Brenner preyed upon one of his former female guards, treating her as an insubordinate when he had already been relieved of his Captaincy. Despite having plenty of opportunity to inform her that he no longer retained his position, he continued with the farce until the rest of the house confronted him about it. How shameful and depressing that a once great soldier of the Avoirdupois would stoop to such things.", "Oh no!  Basanti isn't in the habit of answering important scrolls in a timely manner!  And she's one of the higher ranking members of the Church!  We're doomed I tell you!  The end times are upon us!  REPENT SINNERS!  REPENT!", "Once again, Gentleman Sattar proves to be incapable of bowing to his betters, and furthermore he verbally invites fire upon another house when he was cordially wished that the light bless him. Is there no end to his disrespect?", "Sir Althalus certainly is taking initiative lately! I heard he has a plot in the works to hold a tournament for the guards of every embassy. Maybe even the commoners will get to compete, wouldn't that be exciting? Woo!", "Sir Althalus will be holding a tournament, but it hasnt happened yet.", "Some people find Sir Edmond irritating. Others do not. Do you like green eggs and ham?", "Sir Edmond has flexed his political muscles and made an agreement with Viscountess Aedina regarding promotions. Did you know that he's fabulous at sucking up as well? Yep. Not all Nobles were promoted for their skill with a sword.", "Sattar's supposed to be a gentleman and Bisclavret gentry, right?  Then how come he spends all of his time in the commons being rude and slandering people?  In fact, just the other day, I overheard him using coarse language in front of a group of ladies.  Words like, \\"patootie\\" and \\"rubbish\\" and \\"balderdash\\".", "So you know Bayard, right?  Do I need to say much more about him?  Apparently I do.  My brother-in-law's foot fungal expert told me he likes to dress up in masks, pretend to be a commoner again, and doesn't properly bow to nobles.  Even peers.  What's with that?", "Virendra should really be more careful about how he does his politicking and conspiring.  Apparently he'll talk to anonymous people just about anywhere.  And when some poor, unfortunate soul comes along, he'll tell them to go forth and multiply.  Tisk tisk.", "Sang's got this annoying way of slurring his speech.  You've heard it I'm sure.  Sounds like he's drunk or addled in the head.  But that doesn't stop him from blathering on and on and on about nonsense that doesn't need to be said.  Plus he's cocky.  I wonder if all artsy types are like that.", "That Anabella is pretty disagreeable slave.  But apparently she has a soft spot for cubs.  Maybe she shouldn't be strung up by her neck.", "That Sattar.  He's been gone a while and probably forgot how Triskellian works.  Now he's back and insulting nobility at his leisure.  And he was arrested for it.  Who made him what he is, I wonder?", "It's not news, but Chesh is in the habit of drinking, cursing, and spitting.  Not necessarily in that order.  Commoners are bad, mmmkay?", "That Marcel.  And his owner, Theressa.  He has a mouth on him and she doesn't care.  You'd think a noble of any sort would want a slave that's better behaved.  Or at least attempt to correct his behavior.", "You want irony?  I got irony.  Chinco went ahead and threatened people to attend lectures on courtesy.  Some mook didn't go.  So Chinco was courteous enough to punch him in the face.  Yeah, I thought the irony was delicious too.", "News!  News!  I've got new!  Commoners go around insulting each other pointlessly!  Like Naomi!  I bet you're surprised.", "Thieves aren't all that uncommon in Docktown.  Depending on who you ask.  But that Dodger, he, she, it, is the worst.  Incredibly rude, even in apologies.  One of these days, a rough and tumble guard is going to teach them a lesson.", "Hush, Hush, Hush!  No don't be quiet, silly, Hush!  The doctor!  She's a person you want on your team and isn't afraid to use her University's resources to help!", "If you're giving out advice, Hush wants to hear it.  She might not apply it, but she'll be polite and gracious in the process.  Now if only my sister was the same way when I talk about her husband being a lazy good for nothing.", "Minerva makes good impressions, even when dealing with someone who gives me the willies.  Responding reasonably, she doesn't simper or become aggressive.  Balance in all things.  One body.  One mind.  Harmony within.  Harmony without.  Sunshine and rainbows and flowers.", "Not only is she a doctor, Hush is a great teacher!  Just go ask her for a lesson!  The best cure for anything is a grasshopper leg and eye of newt.", "Flynn's an admiral I hear.  But he's not above serving drinks when the slavers gather.  Kind of makes you wonder if they're emperors and queens.", "If you're a doctor and you need to bandage Sunta, don't worry!  She has all the bandages you need!", "Generous doctor!  She provides her services free of charge!  How wonderful is that?!  Charity is too uncommon for those who truly need it.... like guards of the Great Houses.  They need all the charity they can get.  Seriously.", "They say that Cerridwyn has a great many suitors since she has come to Triskellian.  And she's doing the right and proper thing by considering each and every one of them.  Not rushing in like any commoner would.  Adhering to her father's wishes and propriety.  That's good stuff.", "Chinco's got a habit of offering to break peoples' necks for them.  Even when there are other options.  He's kind of a one-trick jenner, huh?", "Not only does he offer to break peoples' necks, Chinco encourages slaves to break slavers' necks.  Just because the slaver treated a slave like a slave.  Power to the people?", "Hush is in the habit of bringing people gifts.  Especially valueless ones.  Like carrots.  How nice of her!  It's the thought that counts, really.", "Anabella's a pretty lousy slave most times.  But she's not afraid to tell people to shut their mouths when they start encouraging a slave revolt.", "Slaves are generally bad in Triskellian.  But Anabella's turning into a good slave now that she's owned by Swan!  Helpful, respectful, and uncaring for her own safety sometimes!  Yay for slaves.", "If you need a slave trained, go find Swan.  He's got a steady hand and can turn a malicious, disrespectful piece of property into a model slave.", "Brenner's in the habit of giving stuff to people he doesn't like.  Maybe a whipping is just what he needed.", "Slaves shouldn't swear at commoners.  Seriously.", "No really, slaves shouldn't swear at commoners.  Especially when being asked to do a favor.", "Brenner's in the habit of looking after his House's interests.  This includes disciplining unruly slaves so that the slave's owner and the House as a whole saves face.", "Brenner's starting to practice his drawing.  Not only that, he's drawing religious imagery.  That's a good horsey.", "Brenner's trying to mend his ways after getting smacked around by his superiors in the Avoirdupois.  He's polite and proper to just about everyone.", "Marcus has always been a good guy.  Like a hero out of legend, he comes into town, fixes everything and then rides off into the sunset.", "He's an attentive slave, let me tell you.  Always making a point of sending tea to people who like tea.  I like tea.  He gave me some.  See?  Proof.", "That Grazia isn't your regular woman.  She takes an interest in politics as well as dresses, tea, and dancing.", "Lianaar's a sharp cookie!  So used to dealing with nobles and higher ups!  Introductions between strangers is important for these people.", "Leading by example and trying to educate the unwashed masses, Katrina is deserving of respect and all that garbage.", "Phineas is charitable, giving clothes to people new to town!  Kind of live every other seamstress or tailor... hmmm.  Do we see a trend?", "Sattar has a history of terrible behavior, having threatened and punched a member of the gentry!  He dishonors all gentry everywhere with his behavior.", "Althalus is a most honorable knight, coming to the defense of fair ladies at all times!  He's credible and so forth!  Wee!", "Instead of automatically hiring a man who has a reputation for being unreliable, Marcus checks around with previous employers to make sure he isn't blacklisted before taking him on.  That's good thinking.", "Leave it to Chinco to go around grabbing on women in public.  And not in a good way, I'm told.", "Cullan has a way of speaking up when it's not welcome.  Like when a flogging is almost over.  But his two bits need to be added about how the thing is being conducted.", "Sattar can't seem to be polite to anyone.  Even people he's requesting things from.  They're just demands.  And woe to a craftsman who doesn't know how to make something!  It gets worse!", "Cullan knows how to bow to nobility.  Good boy.", "Hush stands up boldly for people!  The Doloreaux in particular.  Don't ask me why or how, I'm just repeating what I hear.", "Chinco's bad.  Even to pretty ladies.  Is that so surprising?  I didn't think so either.", "Sattar can't be bothered to bow to anyone!  Anyone I tell you!  Makes you wonder why he bothers to leave his room.", "Sattar happens to enjoy acting lewdly with his wife in front of people.  That's what women are for, I guess.  Though he could keep it behind closed doors.", "Francis is a silly commoner.  He'll go running up to any noble all willy nilly if given the opportunity.  That's just impolite.", "Ryan's a good healer.  Always willing to help.  He even helped Brenner after the horse was flogged.  Go Ryan!", "Marcel has better things to do with his time.  Better things than what?  I don't know.  I guess he needed to go be rude to someone.", "Commoners that don't offer proper deference to their betters?  Perish the thought!", "Rankin's a smelly old sea rat.  Doesn't mean he shouldn't be respectful to cultured ladies.", "Apparently Chinco's a coward these days.  He won't do much to anyone who can't defend themselves.  But he'll encourage others to shoot people.  What's that all about Chinco?", "Leif's a mushy guy at heart.  He'll show compassion to just about anyone.  Go cry on his shoulder, I encourage it.", "That Katrina is productive and willing to spread knowledge with zest!  Knowledge of what?  I'm not sure.  Maybe she could show me a few things in her private library, if you know what I mean.", "Katrina's very proactive for her House.  Yay Katrina, she does lots.", "Katrina is determined to make Triskellian a better place!  If only more people were like her.  This is a skink's den that needs fixing.  But don't tell the Don I said that.", "In case you haven't heard, Brie hands out free clothes to people who have just arrived in Triskellian.  Just in case you didn't know.  Need me to repeat it?", "You hear?  Sattar isn't above yelling at jewelers or badmouthing lePlow.  I wonder if anyone has a problem with that...", "Asima's one of Sattar's girls, I hear.  Don't ask what they do for him.  But I hear tell she ordered some kind of slinky, black leather number if that's any indication.", "Marcel's a lazy good for nothing slave.  All he does is yell at the other slaves like he's better than them and he can't be bothered to clean the trash.", "Seriously, Marcel won't clean the trash.  How many times do I have to tell people that?", "Free pie!  Need I clarify?", "Ryan's self-righteous and high-and-mighty.  Yeah, I giggled too.", "You know Cullan?  I thought you might.  Yeah, he was giving orders to people above him on the food chain.  Not smart, if you know what I mean.", "Did you know that lighting slaves on fire is a popular past time in Sattar's homeland?", "Zaria's a mighty brave gal!  When a knight needed help in combat, she risked her life to aid him!  Insert witty statement here.", "Zaria's got a mouth on her!  Talking about fornication, ew, and pregnancy, yuck, in mixed company with gentry nearby!  Light help me!", "They say Noe broke Brenner's heart.  At least she's political enough to know when it's time to cut dead weight loose.", "Rhea's a good, professional flogger.  She'll do her job regardless of how many people frown up on it.", "When it comes to politics, Aedina's a sharp cookie.  She went around and lobbied other nobles for their opinions on how to punish a misbehaving House member.  That's good in my book.", "Guy's supportive toward Aine.  He understands her goals to better herself.  She might even learn something new!  How's that for snazzy?", "Did you hear that Sir Bayard dressed down to try and blend in as a commoner? That's not so bad, but using a disguise to be rude to fellow Nobles while in Newtown? Unsurprisingly unappreciated. It's a shame that those who are blessed with titles aren't more grateful, and don't set a better example.", "Hooray for a Noble who makes it a personal crusade to promote respect for Nobility. I hear many are unappreciative, but there are those who secretly applaud his endeavors.", "I hear Esquire Brooks does just what a Squire should do - support his Noble. Finally, someone gets the idea.", "Apparently someone's mother didn't teach them about carrying sharp items around young'ns. Polgara was out and about toting her babe through layers of ash while dual wielding a carving knife. It's nice to see that children are still given only to responsible individuals.", "Apparently mister Khagra supports knife-wielding mothers who tow their children through thick ash without a care in the world. For shame!", "Baron Edmond might be strict with punishment, but he sure doesn't seem to care much about the sort of healing those punished received. A severely lashed squire and no doctor in sight? Say it isn't so!", "More and more people speak of Sir Bayard's attempted disguise and his absolute disrespect for a Viscountess and Baron. If he wants to be a commoner again, these sort of acts are the way to ensure it happens! Lets just hope he learns from the whole ordeal.", "Rhea seems to have had some problems handling pirate negotiations when Lady Theressa was kidnapped. They say she didn't assert herself at all, and let the criminals walk all over everyone. Regardless of the fact the Lady is alive, she still got hurt, and fingers are pointing in one direction to place the blame.", "Talk about a bad listener! When warned about Gentleman Sattar, Star still wanted to work for him. She seems absolutely certain there are no underlying intentions behind her employment, but everyone knows the truth. When someone tried to be nice and point out she could be making a mistake, she attacked them! Perhaps being unfriendly is a better way to gain her favor ..", "They say Star likes to hit slaves who try to give her advice. Amazing that a freeman would lower themselves to public assault over simple words, yah? To top it all off she's associating with that Sattar fellow, and she already has a reputation of being a tart. Some people just never learn..", "Pru is so nice! She sends some of her best items to people just to make sure they're used and not lying about.", "Everyone loves fruit, and Shaharazad is happy to give it as an apology. Her family customs might be different, but everyone's on the same page when it comes to food!", "What a good wife Shaharazad is, giving out free fruits to atone for her husband's nasty behavior. Maybe if Sattar would take a few hints from her he wouldn't be so annoying.", "The criminals sure do like a girl who's willing to keep them company behind bars.", "Nobody likes a Noble who plays favorites and then disrespects the rest of her peers. While she might outrank many, Viscountess Aedina still has a responsibility to properly acknowledge those she passes, especially since she is so quick to point it out when others don't do it.", "There aren't many people nowadays who keep true to their word, but Lady Valara is one of them. It's so nice to see a Noble who still has good morals and values.", "Acting a gentleman, Veritas was kind enough to gift out his coat during a rainstorm to an accompanying woman. How sweet.", "Due to some crazy weather, Marea decided to lift her shirt and flash the marketplace, without a single thought to her own reputation. They say she was doing it to save the city. What a martyr she is!", "Flashing isn't necessarily good, regardless of the reasons.", "People have the wrong idea about Shaharazad. She really is a kind, helpful, and real fine woman.", "For a married man trying to find the Light, Geradan sure does know how to take advantage of women. During a big storm recently, he told some woman to lift her shirt and flash the wind in defiance, and she actually did it! It's just low he would even suggest that kind of behavior, and disappointing.", "Meepers decided to accuse a Baronet of being daft in the way of elementals. Hah. As if she is some sort of authority on magical beings.", "A gentry woman should know the proper procedure for duels, but alas, Meepers does not. She started spouting off conditions to Baronet Althalus before he even accepted! Still, at least she has enough of an idea of honor to not stand for being called a fool.", "It isn't nice to call people idiots, especially gentryfolk. Mari apparently didn't know that.", "This lass is capable of calling people out without being direct or rude; what a gift! I hear she was very polite when she corrected gentry woman Meepers for insulting Baronet Althalus.", "Acting a gentleman, mister Cullan was kind enough to escort a gentrywoman back to her room. He's also very good support during arguments, in case you ever need someone.", "Nobles shouldn't disrespect gentryfolk, and they especially shouldn't call them stupid. Baronet Althalus supposedly has some issues with people trying to aid him with situations outside of his realm of understanding.", "What a delightful girl Katrina is, and always such a pleasure to be around!", "Public declarations of people's stupidity are not generally well-received, but Mari makes them anyway. Even if people are idiots, or worse, are ranked idiots, it isn't her place to say so, lest she look like an idiot herself.", "Sattar really needs to stop snapping at his wife when there are witnesses around, especially when she's only trying to make sure he's alright. Nobody likes it, everyone hates it, and they want him to go eat mud.", "Finally a gentlewoman who understands propriety and tradition! Rumor has it that Cerridwyn is planning on debuting herself to any eligible bachelors interested in pressing suit. Grab some new outfits men, and get in line!", "What a misunderstood soul Sattar is. It's unfortunate that people don't look deep enough to see his heart, as he really is a kind and family-oriented man.", "A pox on Meepers for having a bad past! It's no wonder commoners are so very disrespectful to those of rank, with her being the only example of gentry around for so long. Having previous occupations as a slave and a woman of the night certainly don't help her case, nor does the fact that she rummages around in trash bins for dead vermin. Where does all that money she makes from clothing go? I wonder ..", "Despite being able to have any man she might want, including a Baron, miss Brooks conceded to her father's choice for marriage and continues to honorably defend that choice. It sets such a good example, her being so obedient and loyal to her family.", "Did you hear Lord Marcus sponsored someone in the Bisclavret for promotion? He did! And all in the name of strengthening house ties. What a good Noble.", "Lord Marcus and the Rinaldi are singing Xena's praises for all the hard work shes done, despite having been in the house for only a short period of time.", "*tisk tisk* Nobles are starting to become aware that Esquire Katrina values the opinions of slaves. Why would you ever listen to the thoughts of anyone so beneath you?", "Just because Sattar is foreign, doesn't mean he has to behave so badly. He's sullying the name of gentry everywhere, and that just isn't right.", "Rude, crass, and violent, Sattar is now making claims that the sylph visitors are demons, and even had the audacity to charge at one! If they are such bad creatures, how is it that he still successfully acts worse than them, and what does that make him?", "No respect, no respect, not even for the Nobility. Word has it that guilds and houses won't even take a second glance at Chinco anymore. Who's the joke now?", "They slay Hush does a really good job of training slaves, and she keeps one who's capable of making special teas. If you're thirsty for something unique, hint around to her.", "People are starting to call Chinco 'the public mule', due to his rude and distasteful behavior.", "Shaharazad was gifted a rose from a slave, but her husband threw a tantrum, and so she tossed the precious flower right onto the ground and didn't give it another look. Even if she didn't want it she shouldn't have been so tactless, and if she did, she shouldn't have been so cowardly. With her and her husband being gentry, they should have better manners.", "When a fellow member of the gentry invited her to tea through a missive, she refused to reply at all. Apparently declining someone is acceptable, but not answering scrolls is not.", "The gentleman sure is getting violent these days! He attempted to attack the visiting Sylph Rhoswen at least once and then continued to intimidate and threaten her in a public area. I sure hope those creatures aren't judging all of us by his actions.", "The Rinaldi appreciate the efforts of Esquire Katrina, who escorted one of her house members to their sitting area to ensure he apologized for rushing past without acknowledgement.", "The Rinaldi appreciate the efforts of Sir Erwin, who insisted one of his house members apologize to the Nobility for rushing past without acknowledgement.", "It takes a man to apologize when he has erred. Though he rushed past two Rinaldi Nobles without so much as an upward glance, he did return to apologize and make amends. That's worth a lot in some people's books.", "Veritas really needs to stop questioning the natural order of things. While it's good to be inquisitive, some people are simply born to rank and honor, and they don't need to explain themselves to the rabble beneath them. Get it? Got it? Good.", "Not everyone can earn Chinco's respect personally, and people are starting to get sore that they have to prove themselves on a continuous basis to such rabble.", "The commoners sing the praises of Shaharazad for giving out free food reasonlessly.", "The populace appreciates Dame Theressa's efforts in getting her slave, Marcel, to collect and bring dew for the visiting sylphs.", "Ryan shouldn't expect to be sided with over spouses, and it's not very nice for himi to jump to conclusions about people, no matter how often they have to placate their husbands.", "Some bash him, some love his sweet heart and generous nature. Ain't it crazy how that works?", "Ryan's really good about apologizing, even if not in the most timely fashion. It's actually a smart tactic .. waiting until people have forgotten what you did wrong before saying how terrible you feel. I bet he finds a lot of forgiveness that way.", "It's so unlike a gentrywoman to throw a tantrum and storm off when she can't explain everything she wants to - unlike every gentrywoman except Katrina, that is. Watch out if you touch on one of the subjects she has 'expertise' in, or you'll get a taste of her bad temper and swift exit.", "Lance Corporal Cullan was kind enough to ask one of the visiting sylphs to heal Brenner. Who even knew the Bisclavret cared about the welfare of the Avoirdupois?", "While well versed in some things, Cullan still can't manage to properly address people. Using first names to chat with gentry isn't the most formal way to go about it, eh?", "Thank the Light there's a jeweler around willing to explain things to people, and encourage their own choices and unique tastes. I hear Lidia even knows all of the inventories of Clover's other jewelers. Want to take a peek? Go and ask!", "Even though he's a merchant and gardener by trade, Ramsford was more than willing to help out the Sheriff in organizing a promotion party. I wonder just how much party organizing experience he has .. or what sort of parties he's used to organizing. Here's looking forward to a sloshed Constabulary!", "The Doloreaux sing the praises of their skilled seamstress, Inalla, and boast about the fine quality of her parasols. If you need something to protect you from the elements, seek this one out!", "People acknowledge and respect the Esquire's attempts to curb the errant behavior of her house's gentryman, Sattar. It's such a relief to know that the Bisclavret don't stand for disgraceful behavior, even amongst their own.", "An Esquire should never have the audacity to challenge a Noble to a duel. Despite the huge rank difference, which is obvious, it's generally disrespectful. To top it off, Meepers even started citing terms and demands before the challenge was even accepted. Seriously ... what is wrong with her?", "Sometimes I just can't believe my ears! Madalina walked into a public area to announce that Chinco had bedded her. When nobody acted interested she rushed off sulking. What did she expect people to do?", "Want to hear all about Chinco's prowess with the ladies? Just ask Madalina, who is all too familiar. Apparently she's a jilted lover, seeking revenge against him for his loss of interest. To make it even more interesting, she's offered the Doloreaux a gang of thugs willing to beat him up on their behalf.", "The business types of the city are claiming to be smarter than the nobles, I hear. They are certainly better at making money, but are they better at running the city? At least they're smart enough not to say anything to the nobles faces.", "I hear that Xena, she rewards those that do good work for her. Sometimes more than was necessary. I wish the innkeeper was like that. I cleaned the entire stables, and all I got was one mug of ale. In a dirty glass.", "Shaharazad should be commended for her duty and attention to her wifely obligations, especially considering who she's married to.", "Admiral Flynn disrespected the seamstress Brie by implying that she was a useless member of society! Doesn't he know Rainbow Rags is a guild on the guild council? Guilds don't get that sort of position by being useless.", "Zeiss not only murdered Doctor Hush, but when he finally decided to compensate her, he arranged a deal which she agreed with, and then he postponed payments for months! Don't ever listen to the promises of a weasel.", "That Ryan sure does take good care of the city plant life. People haven't ever seen a slave do the kind of work he does, even though they're supposed to. Those enforcers need to get the rest of the slaves in line!", "Even though she was getting ready to leave and take care of her own stuff, Doctor Hush stopped and offered to teach a slave about healing if they wanted to learn. That someone goes out of their way to educate city slaves is a great service to the city.", "That Marea is a real find when it comes to organization and taking charge! When LePlow was out of town, she ran everything in his absence.", "Lady Grazia attended and supported Baronet Althalus while fighting the pirate lord Quentin McGabe, despite fears that she might be kidnapped and made a captive. Can't really say how smart she was for doing so, but she also gave a token to the defeated Captain when he lost. Talk about taking risks!", "Baronet Althalus not only defeated the pirate Captain, Quentin McGabe, he also won honor for his house and ended a pirate threat. Who knows what benefits the services of the captain may lead to in the future? Ah, the suspense.", "Baronet Althalus won the hand-to-hand duel between himself and pirate Captain Quentin McGabe, showing his battle prowess and dedication to freeing his lands of a pirate threat. Hooray!", "That Dahlia offered Baronet Althalus a luck charm just before his duel with pirate Captain Quentin McGabe. It takes guts for a commoner to just proffer something to a Noble like that, and it seems like the charm worked, too, as the Baronet claimed victory!", "For shame! Gentleman Sattar has proven he is incapable of paying his debts even after three months! Is there any mis-step this man hasn't made as of yet?", "I hear that Eddy's a fan of taking coin from people, especially those who say they don't have any work for him. Don't bother to tell him to ask instead of steal either, as he's prone to saying if he wanted to hear lectures he'd stay awake in church. I wonder what the clergy think about that statement?", "It's a shame what atrocious manners Ms. Donatella has. I heard she went in the commons and immediately starting barking questions out about her Lord and where he was, completely disregarding the presence of her betters in the area.", "Does anyone else realize how much time Doctor Jahren puts into his patients and bettering himself? People say he has spent most of his time and money on his guild and ensuring there's enough free training for all his employees who want to learn.", "Elizabeth pointed out to gentleman Sattar that it's improper to insult a Noble's slave to someone else. She said that instead he should just take his complaints directly to Baronet Althalus. Witnesses enjoyed her lecturing the gentleman, but there's something to be said too about the impropriety of a commoner speaking like that to a member of gentry.", "Gentleman Sattar dubbed Lia an 'absolutely insufferable creature', and right in front of her husband no less. It's one thing to ridicule a slave for their behavior, if it's pertinent, but quite another to ridicule someone's wife and disrespect the husband simultaneously. That Sattar is just lucky he isn't dealing with the old pirate Geradan, or who knows what body parts he might be missing.", "With his public apology on the forums, people are seeing Gentleman Sattar is at least beginning to repair his tarnished honor. Moreover, they're hoping that this isa new for him since it seems like he's running out of chances to fix his reputation.", "In full view of her husband, Marcel professed to Lia how much he missed her. Ordinarily not a problem, right? Well, it wouldn't be, except that Marcel has a history of trying to kiss and romance Lia when her husband isn't around. Ahhhh, the dramas of slavery.", "When asked about making a new and better statue to represent former Reeve Leah, mister Dune was exceedingly helpful in suggesting variations of stone or marble that would work best, and also offered to travel outside of town to seek something more suitable than what was in his own inventory. When compensation was offered for his time and effort, he declined, saying he was merely happy to serve the Rinaldi. His willingess to help and go above and beyond the call of duty is something to appreciate and respect.", "Doctor Hush was chatting with a woman in the commons today and questioning her about the last time she bled naturally. Good grief, talk about inappropriate, not to mention the lack of confidentiality people expect from Doctors.", "A lunatic threatened miss Elizabeth, and calm as can be she told him to apologize and leave. It's amazing how polite and proper she is, even under the worst of circumstances.", "Tibbs threatened a Noble's propety and assaulted a free woman, with her own parasol no less! Sounds like one for the Constables, eh? Hope the people involved were smart enough to take up the problem with the slavers and the law.", "Everyone loves a free spirit, but a loincloth in the middle of the commons? Talk about inappropriate.", "Mistress Meepers has a really come a long way since first arriving in Triskellian, and done a good job of applying herself to the studies of genteel society. I wish I could say the same for some of the other gentry.", "Talk about a spunky raccoon! That Lianaar built herself up to the running the Bisclavret embassy purely on her own wits, and even managed to part from the house on good terms. Then, instead of sponging off her fiance's guild, she strikes off on her own again to find her own path.", "People still talk about what the Presbyter did to Adriana. Debts might not always come due quick in Docktown, but they always come due.", "Avoirdupois chivalry at its finest! Thukal not only helped carry heavy barrels, but when offered payment, he refused and said he was just happy to help!", "Eldro's all the chatter lately, but somehow people didn't notice he's a he and not a she. People are raving about how innocuous she is, sitting in the background not bothering anyone. Scary that if you sit back far enough your gender gets swapped.", "After her last incident with Gentleman Sattar, slave Lia has learned it's best to keep a low profile and not instigate any problems with him. It's a shame so many of the other slaves are gluttons for punishment when they obviously know how he is.", "Even after Gentleman Sattar argued with Ryan about him giving his wife gifts, Ryan continued to send more gifts behind the gentryman's back, and then got angry when the gifts were returned to him! Could Ryan be suffering from a mental ailment or a medical condition?", "Sergeant Danae loitered around the jailhouse blabbing judgmentally about Gentleman Sattar while he was trying to deal with his charges. Then, she had the audacity to turn around and try to barter her OWN punishments with the Sheriff at the very same time! So very rude, and unbecoming of a Constabulary member.", "What a mongrel! I hear Asima has been sleeping around with dirty, rude men, and hiding it from her owners and employers! Even worse, she's proud of what she's doing, and that's just plain ole' trashy.", "Aww, how sweet, Gentleman Sattar is finally apologizing to his wife for his inappropriate public scenes. She educated me about how it takes a decent man to set aside his pride and admit when he's wrong. It's just strange how much she loves him.", "Squire Tonozzi was kind enough to lend Shaharazad money to help pay Gentleman Sattar's fines. How charitable and kind!", "Oh my!  Fighting within the Church's ranks!  It turns out just recently Yarwoodle accused Pastor Savryn of stealing from the Church!  From what I heard, he did not even approach Savryn or ask him about what happened before making his high accusations!  Who is Yarwoodle you ask?  He's that crazy hermit priest who can't quite get his sentences straight.", "That Esquire Aysun works tirelessly and diligently for the betterment of the Bisclavret. Every single time Gentleman Sattar is rude and impolite, she is right there to apologize for him and smooth things over, limiting any damage done to her embassy.", "Star has a genuine appreciation for music that most people lack. When Sang was playing his violin in the commons, nobody paid any attention whatsoever, and seeing that his attempt to lighten the mood had no effect, he stopped. Star encouraged him to carry on playing and listened when no others would. A crush, perhaps, or just enjoyment of fine melodies? Who knows, but her efforts to include people and support their good attempts are something to be grateful for.", "Sattar was in jail and practically begged Sheriff Joshua to talk to the magistrate on his behalf to get his punishments changed. The Sheriff agreed to do the favor for him on several conditions, one being that the Gentleman start showing respect to the Constabulary and the Sheriff himself. After the terms were agreed upon, and the Sheriff confirmed he would visit the magistrate as soon as possible, Shaharazad arrived with money to pay the gentryman's fines, at which point he automatically turned back on his deal with the Sheriff. Can you imagine striking a deal with the law and breaking it? I hope for his sake Sattar doesn't end up back in jail, or his negotiations will probably be short and not in his favor.", "Sattar made a deal with Sheriff Joshua to talk to the magistrate on his behalf so his punishments could get changed and he wouldn't have to remain imprisoned. Just after the deal was struck, Shaharazad arrived with coin to pay the fines, at which point the gentleman began prattling off about how he didn't need any favors, and then demanded the payment for the favors back! He doesn't want favors? I doubt he'll find any with the Sheriff again.", "The good Squire Cullan offered to act as a guard and escort for gentlewoman Aysun, only to stand in the background guzzling down spirits! What started out as a kindness turned into unprofessionalism very fast.", "That Luciano has a mouth on him! I heard he told mister Fyros publicly to shut his mouth, and then started accusing other people in the area of violent crimes without having any proof! Here's a hint, Lucky; if you know of a violent crime, you report it to the Constabulary.", "After a public spat between two of his 'girls', Sattar dragged them both off. Moments later they returned, one of them having a cigar burn in her ear! It looks like Sattar thinks he's above the law with his eccentric forms of 'discipline'.", "Mister Veritas is being very generous with his time and company resources in helping to get people established in the city. They all seem to be appreciative of his kindness.", "No wonder Sattar doesn't have any respect for Geradan and Lia's marriage, he doesn't have any respect for his own! He was going around hugging other women that aren't his wife, and all clingy-like too, in full public view! Someone saw him snuggling up cozy to that Shirin woman, and whispering in her ear right in the commons. For shame!", "Esquire Katrina always gives excellent political advice, and isn't afraid to do investigative work to make sure it's the best. She's always looking for opportunities to expand the Doloreaux's influence, and she maintains contact with all the embassy's allies. It's no wonder she's being made the Doloreaux's official political advisor!", "A nobleman asked mister Ambrose whether or not he was ready to swear fealty to a house, and instead of giving a straight answer, he responded with a theoretical treatise about loyalty. Perhaps some thought should be put into guilds for this one, especially if he's going to offend Nobility.", "Ammy was hugging all over her slave in the middle of the commons, and when someone mentioned it made them uncomfortable and wasn't really proper, she continued to do it saying she can do what she wants, when she wants, and she doesn't care what other people think. While hugging in and of itself isn't inappropriate, hugging a slave in public? Not the best idea in the world.", "While Ammy might be a lovely person, she shouldn't be hugging on her slave in the common area, telling people that he's 'more than a friend'.", "I hear Donatella was peeping at mister Brenner over the screen in the infirmary when he had clearly wanted privacy as Doctor Hush worked on him. How inappropriate, especially for someone honored with the title of Squire.", "Admiral Flynn attended one of Xena's courtesy classes to try to learn how to act better. He even let her make him the girl in one of her examples! What a good sport.", "That slave Lia came out of the church holding a man's hand ... and .. surprise! It wasn't her husband's! She was lifted nonchalantly by her partner-in-crime in hopes that nobody would see him gift her with a shiny new bracelet. Oooo. I think people need to be more sneaky, because somebody saw.", "Esquire Mathias was holding the slave Lia's hand coming out of the church. He lifted her from the ground and laughed at her before slipping a bracelet into her hand, telling her to be quiet. His fiance was next to him the whole time, and she didn't utter a word. Interesting how slaves and gentry interact these days, no?", "It doesn't pay to get too familiar with your slave. Doctor Hush had her arm around Ryan's shoulders as if they were lovers! How improper!", "It doesn't pay to get too familiar with your owner! Doctor Hush had her arms around Ryan's shoulders as if they were lovers! How entirely improper!", "Brenner has been making a real effort to be respectful and polite all the time. He's a good example of proper behavior, and it's so great to see that he learned from his punishment and turned over a new leaf.", "Apparently Lia doesn't see the need in bowing or acknowledging people anymore. Have you seen how she just bobs her head and then mostly does nothing? Terrible manners.", "Lia seems to think it's appropriate to act as though she's equal with members of a different house! She was whispering to Gentleman Mathias even in front of Lady Theressa, which is incredibly rude to begin with, and then later she was all over Mathias' arm, while his own fiance was on the other arm! She seriously needs to learn that her place isn't even equal to that of a freeman, let alone a gentlewoman.", "Can you believe that alley cat and his ego? The size of Calabria I tell you. If anyone in the Avoirdupois acted as he did, they would find themselves without a House. That Gentleman Sattar should certainly learn some respect for his peers and his betters after the way he jaunted through the commons, glaring at Esquire Aeryn. The gall he has after she deigned curtsy to her inferiors. No acknowledgment to those of his House or even to Gentleman Mathias.", "I hear that Lady Theressa is finally punishing her slave, Marcel, even having him whipped for having coins in his room!", "That tactless mutt, Virendra, had the nerve to stand around sharing his 'opinion' with the members of his guild about how he so strongly dislikes Gentleman Sattar, speaking at length to his employee to discern his own opinion before dragging him off to conspire further. It is shameful behavior to openly trash talk a man right in the presence of his wife! He should be ashamed of himself!", "I hear Brenner is really good about promptly paying crafters for services rendered, and what's more, he didn't take advantage of Specialist Lulu's offer for a cheaper deal in exchange for a kiss on the cheek. What a pillar of courtesy!", "Gentleman Sattar asked a jeweler for metals to use for his meteor rock, and then started being rude to her right after doing so! If you want to do business with someone, you surely don't treat them like they're an idiot or flick them a bunch of attitude.", "Someone's fairly upset about mister Brenner asking for Squire Donatella's permission to leave rather than their own. Captain, house superior, ranking member? No, lets get dismissal from someone in the Bisclavret instead.", "First Brenner couldn't be bothered to attend a lecture on courtesy even after he was advised to go by a member of his House's gentry, and then the next thing you know, he's yelling across the commons, informally greeting a Bisclavret Knight. I think he needed that lesson after all..", "Talk about obedient slaves! Apparently Caliste is so well trained that she'll thank the enforcers for keeping her in line. Gives a new meaning to the phrase \\"whipped\\"! But, hey, she's one of the better behaved slaves in the city.", "The constabulary and Bisclavret have always had a somewhat rocky relationship. Now, it looks like Viscountess Kenina is trying to smooth out the relationship... with gifts of alcohol. I can't fault her intentions, but only a Bisclavret would offer Moonshine to anyone other than a commoner!", "Remember the chapel? The one in Docktown? Remember how it was haunted, there were creepy ghostly groans and moans that were coming from under the stairs? The priests are talking about how the moans have returned. Some are calling for exorcists, others are eyeing Cullan and Tomoe suspiciously. I have no idea what's going on!", "Do you know Shirin? I hear she comes from some distant land where men stroke women's hair in public. Simply scandelous! But Shirin knows better, and tells Akomish men not to act inappropriately while here. Akomish? Is that even a word? Does it matter? I hear they are all savages! At least Shirin is civilized! Maybe there is hope for those people.", "Did you know that Xena is a burgher? Maybe that's why she's giving up whiskey. She's not going to rise much higher unless she starts drinking it from a cup instead of a bottle.", "Threats? From Geradan-the-pirate? Business as usual. Except when it chases away business for the seamstresses. Then the pirate is really in trouble, I hear those women are scarier than any navy!", "I overheard that pirates were upsetting seamstresses by making threats in the seamstress shop. And guess which slave was there. The slavers may as well just sell her as a cabin girl and be done with it!", "Tisk. Either get your clothes fitted, Mr Tibbs. Or make threats in back alleys. Being efficient is nice and all, but don't try to do them simultaneously.", "Have you heard about the new woman in town? Perpetua just arrived, but already knows how to speak properly to higher ranks, and remembers to excuse herself before leaving. Personally, I think she's a suck up - but that's what nobles look for, isn't it?", "Geradan? Attending and helping out at courtesy classes? Maybe he really is trying to turn over a new leaf.", "Flynn? Attending and helping out at courtesy classes? It's true, then. Whatever Geradan does, Flynn copies.", "You know Gemma? That rabbit has whatever the opposite of manners are. She even attended a courtesy meeting just to say she doesn't want to listen to it. What would the neighbors think?", "I'm hearing good things about Miss Xena. Either because she's been running courtesy lessons for the commoners. Or because she made Admiral Flynn pretend to be a girl during those lessons. I'm not sure which, but I think I'll start attending.", "Miss Xena spent all morning teaching manners. Do we need these lessons? I ain't had no schooling, but I still know to spit on your hand before shaking.", "Mister Veritas is certainly popular with the lay-dees. Even while attending a courtesy lecture he managed to schmooze with a gentlewoman. At least he was at the courtesy lecture...", "Miss Xena. Teaches courtesy. Every loves her. I'm so bored of hearing about how great she is. Why doesn't anyone ever talk about me and my earwax collection instead?", "You know the city is in a sorry state of affairs when a slave is teaching courtesy to free people. Maybe the slavers need to start whipping the rest of docktown into shape too?", "Word on the street - Fyros was helping answer questions at the courtesy meeting. I might have to find him, and ask which side of my mouth I should belch from. Har ha!", "I hear Kirill is on to a good strategy. He attends courtesy class, then hangs around afterwards to catch up on house affairs. Makes him look well mannered and educated.", "Sir Erwin! He was in the lounge when a courtesy meeting started, and helpfully walked out of the room without even saying a word. What a great way to give the participants an example to discuss how to leave a room properly. What a jape!", "Chesh was asked what he wanted to do, and decided to 'go pick on a few nobles and cause trouble' - commoners, stirring up trouble with nobles? Say it ain't so!", "The seamstresses tell me that Ofello pays his bills promptly, and tips well. And he's so handsome! Wait, the seamstresses think he's handsome, not me.", "Hear about Squire Cullan talking about how his kilt helps him pretend to be a girl? What a whoopsy! For shame, man. A kilt is a very manly garment. What do the other Bisclavret think about you implying they wear skirts?", "Aysun was also at the courtesy lecture. You'd think that the only thing people have to talk about is that darn courtesy meeting! Next time the constabulary report a mugging, I'm sure they'll be talking about how *polite* the mugger was!", "Everyone knows about Sattar, right? But did you know about Donatella? Curling her tail around people? Inviting them to go \\"somewhere private\\"? They're as subtle as each other, a perfect match!", "Shhh, have you heard? Gentleman Mathias has been treating that Doloreaux slave as if she was someone of status. Even holding her elbow while they walked. A gentleman! And a slave! A slave from a rival house! This is perfect fodder for the romantic comedy I'm writing, think Nan might run it as a humerous play?", "Why would a gentlewoman, her fiance, and a Doloreaux slave be walking back and forth through docktown, not even stopping to greet anyone? How strange!", "Why would a Doloreaux slave be wandering around with two betrothed Avoirdupois gentry? And not even trailing behind at a respectful distance, walking with them as if they were all equals. What if children had seen?", "They say that slave, Ryan, is pushy. But I hear he was just trying to get people to help while trying to save Sir Bayard's life. I might not like the knight, but really, that seems reasonable to me. What sort of a person wouldn't help a dying knight?", "The slave Caliste remembered to thank people for their help during the recent medical emergency. That's something which can easily slip your mind, but she remembered. Maybe the rumors that she used to be gentry are true?", "Did you hear that Sir Bayard's heart gave out? And when Veritas was told to help he had a tantrum and said he \\"should have walked on past\\"? I don't think he'll be getting a gift hamper from the ponies this year.", "I hear that horse slave Caliste ended up on her knees and getting dirty while trying to help Sir Bayard. I wouldn't mind her on her knees getting dirty with me, if you know what I mean? What? She's only a slave, lighten up!", "Ha! Funniest thing I heard all day! Veritas got wine splashed in his face. He should know not to insult gentry, they keep drinks ready just in case.", "That slave Ryan gets away with causing so much trouble! I suppose he can do that, after saving the lives of his mistress and a knight.", "Laughing in the face of a gentlewoman? Oh my! I hope Madalina didn't have bad breath.", "Virendra's wife doesn't mind her manners around gentry. But Mister Virendra does correct her behavior. That's what I like to see, a man taking control of his household.", "I know Mister Virendra cheats on his wife. Really, what man doesn't? But you know what's unacceptable? He lets his wife find out, and fight with him about it in public. Make your wife keep it behind closed doors, Vir.", "Ha! So Virendra has a huge public argument with his wife about his mistress. Shocking enough alone. But the next day Shade is cozying up to him. I guess she knows he's easy. But should a woman really be looking for easy men?", " I hear Squire Cullan helped out an old Bisclavret soldier, giving him a cloak and regailing him with honor. Whether or not that honor was owed is up for debate, but still, way to make old men feel useful.", "That Faile sure can give some good examples of how to deal with unruly slaves! Put a hot coal in their mouths so they can't speak for awhile if you have a chatterbox issue. Woo, every day I find more reasons to appreciate my freedom.", "Virendra's always running off to be alone with women other than his wife. At least if he's gonna do that he could practice a little discretion, huh? Pfuh, and they say this man possesses leadership qualities.", "You should see how Senora acts when someone flirts with the Knight Sir Erwin, narrowing her eyes, flattening her ears, and snorting. If you have feelings for a Noble, you should use more discretion and hide it, especially when they're out of your league.", "The other clergy have begun to complain about Bishop Yarwoodle leaving town for extended periods of time. Apparently when he returned this time, he accused Pastor Savryn of stealing from the church. Even more outrageous, they imply he didn't even bother to found out about the Pastor's donations, which more than covered whatever he might have taken out. Or so they say ...", "Baron Althalus really needs to learn to keep his slave in line. I heard she was trying to drag Rankin out of the commons by force, and was bossing everyone around, even demanding that the Sheriff 'go to her office' to see people regarding a crime. What kind of slave has an office and tries to tell free people and Nobles what to do?! Worse, what kind of owner would let her?", "I don't know who that Lia thinks she is. Apparently Rankin was hurt and she demanded to know 'what the hell happened'. After he told her he was attacked in the Turret Tavern by a Noble, she grabbed his arm and attempted to forcibly drag him back to that very same location! Why? Because she claims that's where her office is! I don't know about that, but I certainly wouldn't be trusting the slave of the Noble who tried to hurt me.", "Honestly, how daft can you be? Who in their right mind brashly tells a Countess that they're going to throw her house members out of a wedding?! Esquire Mathias does, and you know .. even if he had a perfectly good reason for it, there are better ways to make your intentions known. Tact, my friends, learn it, practice it, use it.", "I hear Sir Erwin attacked Rankin in response to his assaulting Esquire Lilandra, a Doloreaux gentlewoman. Despite the pirate having a reputation of being a fighter, the Knight allowed him to wake up from a drunken stupor and arm himself before any attacking commenced. While very chivalrous, I have to say .. there are times in a Knight's life and certain people to whom such courtesy shouldn't or doesn't need to be extended.", "During a House meeting, it was suggested that everyone pray for Sir Bayard, as he was most recently ill. Lady Theressa would not allow the request, saying praying needed to only occur during mass. No offense, Lady, but S'allumer listens to you no matter the time or place.", "That Squire Tonozzi is a good friend to have if you're a criminal. I hear she won't rat you out for nothin'!", "Apparently Mister Brenner took a recent Avoirdupois house meeting as an opportunity to attempt to humiliate one of his Knights. He was said to be snorting rudely, making pointed comments about relationships that had nothing to do with matters at hand, and which were private, and then continued to be generally obnoxious. I guess that flogging didn't teach him much after all. Tisk, tisk.", "Someone's still bitter about being removed from his former position, and hes taken a liking to mocking and patronizing Sir Brooks for it. Now, now Brenner, you had your turn. Be a nice horse and share.", "It's not a common occurence for a gentrywoman to try and heft a large man, but miss Brooks did it. After Sir Bayard collapsed with heart problems, she assisted healers in carrying him to the infirmary. Beauty and brawn!", "In the middle of a house meeting, Esquire Mathias had the nerve to refer to Lady Theressa as 'Lady Loveliness'. She is lovely, I have to say, but that's beside the point. He also has been seen removing himself from conversations with his fiance to chat to Countess Aedina alone and unchaperoned. Do you see how my tongue is waggling? That's a bad sign. Perhaps mister Sabot has finally set his attentions to something higher than miss Brooks, and is seeking affection from Nobles.", "That Squire Tonozzi has some brass ones! She explained to Gentleman Sattar, in very clear terms, how the Bisclavret were not amused with his constant breeches of etiquette and of the law, and that if he didn't get in line, woh! Watch out! I'd normally expect a Noble to chide someone of gentry status, but I'm just lowly riff-raff, so what do I know?", "So Doctor Temperance was telling everyone that Anabella is contagious. I didn't know you could catch slavery. What? Oh. She had a disease that was contagious? Then why did the doctor just leave her in a room full of people?", "Did you hear that Cullan kissed his betrothed in public? No, we're not talking about the cheek. I wonder what her father would think?", "You know the rules? Try to use a stick if you have to touch a slave, and always wash your hands afterwards. I heard that Anabella is contagious with... something. Probably slave rot. And she doesn't keep away from crowded places.", "If you see a man wearing a comet-embroidered codpiece, you might want to keep your distance. He's been known to thrust towards peoples faces. His poor wife must be so embarrassed.", "So, remember how I said Doctor Temperance left a contagious patient in the commons with a crowd of people? Maybe I spoke too soon. It seems that Doctor Jahren also feels that the commons is the right place to treat them. I suppose the fountain is a convenient source of water for the doctoring. People drink from that, man!", "Doctor Hush. Seems she's trying to marry into the Doloreaux, and if so, she's going about it the right way. Dating their lieutenant, attending their courtesy lectures. The piggies are really starting to raise their status, aren't they? And is Doctor Hush on the guild council, or not?", "Talk about taking one for the team! It seems the Doloreaux is setting up Lieutenant Lief for an arranged marriage with Doctor Hush. I bet they want to get the university on their side. I don't think it's so bad, Hush can nurse me anytime, if you know what I mean. What if they try the same with the slavers? Who'd want to marry Faile?", "I hear that Doloreaux nobles are going around beating up commoners. Sure, the guy had it coming but... don't nobles usually send their guards, rather than do it themselves? Who can tell the difference between a piggy noble and a piggy commoner?", "Did you hear? I know it happened behind closed doors, but I hear that an Avoirdupois started yelling when asked to pray for the recovery of Sir Bayard. I thought the Avoirdupois were religious!", "So everyone is talking about the nobles that were beating up on a commoner. Yeah, I know they can get away with it, but they were doing it personally! Nobles, sullying themselves with attempted murder! When there are so many assassins without work. You have the money, stop being so miserly! I hope they go to prison, just for the sake of the economy.", "I hear Rankin the Rat's been going around telling everyone that he rules the streets. And, just to prove it, he's been attacking gentry if they forget to bow to him. I'm glad the Doloreaux stepped in. If you ask me, only one way to deal with scum like this. You hold him, I'll hit him!", "Beat up a gentry, get beaten up worse by the Doloreaux. I've heard the boars are tough, stubborn, and loyal to their own. Althalus is a great example of the strengths of the Doloreaux. Only the Doloreaux could let one of their nobles get away with a brawl in the bar without a demotion...", "Wow. A public post complaining that the constables haven't arrested anyone for a crime. When there's no evidence and the constables have no right to arrest. How dare they follow the laws, those fiends! Who would throw around accusations like that? Yeah, most people in the city would. But THIS note was signed by Sattar. And what's more, he even signed it as \\"Gentleman of the Bisclavret.\\" Are the Bisclavret now challenging the Don's laws? This will be interesting!", "Virendra? Yeah, I know he's a freak, but when a commoner tried standing up and tell the nobles to follow the law, he backed them. That's what the Sailor's Guild has always been about! Now let's see if Vir follows through, and keeps the pressure on.", "Did you hear? Sattar lit a cigar! In the library! Why is that news? I don't know. He's a man, men smoke. They especially smoke while at meetings or while reading. Sattar's done so many other things that are way more interesting. I can't imagine *anything* that could be done with a cigar while in a private meeting that would be gossip-worthy.", "This Lord should be chastising his Squire for her terrible manners and poor decorum! He should be training his Squire in the.", "This Lord should be chastising his Squire for her terrible manners and poor decorum! He should be training his Squire in the ways of honor, discretion and manners, not standing by so silently as she takes it upon herself to publicly admonish a man who far outranks her! Has this whole city gone to pieces? How are nobles and genteel persons expected to keep their people in line when they run wild and rampant like a bunch of heathen atavists!? I bet he's asking himself the same question.", "I hear Squire Donatella took it upon herself to publicly chastise Baronet Althalus! As a woman who serves the Nobility of the Bisclavret, she should know that calling a Baronet out on such a public forum is damaging to her credibility and that of her Embassy. She should become educated in honor and proper protocol before she gains any more rank.", "Mister Ramsford stood on the side of evil and wrong-doing, having the nerve to publibly admonish Baronet Althalus' behavior, when the Noble was only standing up for what is right and just! To think that commoners feel so entitled to speak out against their betters. Isn't this what caused the problem in the first place; commoners not minding their station and thinking themselves comparable to the more genteel classes?!

The Rinaldi should be thanking her for all her kindness and warm welcomes.", "Hurrah! Gentleman Sattar stood by the Doloreaux when Rankin slighted their honor. That counts for something, right? Right? Now if only he could learn to stand by and support his own house, that would really be something.", "Even if you're explaining the laws of a city, a Squire should understand the demands of honor and not chastise a Baronet in public or on a public forum for doing what he thinks is right. There does still exist a small thing called discretion, or .. even private conversation, perhaps? A missive? Are these things all becoming things of the past?", "A common street rat threatening and assaulting a gentlewoman? People can scarcely believe that this impertinent scum is still alive, let alone that people are trying to help him! It's a battle of Newtown vs. Docktown .. and I can't wait to see who comes out smelling like roses.", "People are really agitated with Lord Twyrch due to his Squire and her lack of honor. She claimed to be Baronet Althalus' ally and then spoke against him, and even had the tenacity to chastise the Baronet's actions in a public forum! It's great to be a law abiding citizen, there's still propriety and respect you have to observe when you're dealing with your betters.", "More praises for Gentleman Sattar, and all because he supported Baronet Althalus against the comoners with regards to the Noble's obligation to wreak vengeance upon mister Rankin for the unprovoed attack on an unarmed gentrywoman of the Doloreaux.", "Gentleman Sattar spoke out against the Constabulary by calling them incompetent and by supporting the Doloreaux's idea that the Great Houses should be able to handle law matters. I hope the rest of the Bisclavret don't feel that way, because they really should know better; especially that Bisclavret Gentlewoman that was recently sponsored for a promotion by the Rinaldi. Would be a shame to see sponsorships revoked just because someone picked the wrong side ..", "I heard Sir Althalus and Sir Erwin started a manhunt despite it being illegal. As Noblemen and guests of the Rinaldi, they should know better, especially after the Doloreaux and other houses gave their word to support and respect the Constabulary and local law. Maybe it's time the words of the boars are called into question?", "No wonder that Zeiss was excommunicated.

Well, I guess that's fine then. But they still should have taken a chaperone when going into private rooms.", "That Ramsford, he took a risk when declaring that nobles are breaking the law. Brave of him, though.", "That stuff about Lord Twyrch? Turns out that his squire was acting without asking him, and he's now taking her in hand. Good to see leadership in action!", "Boy oh boy, that Squire Donatella! Did you see her mouth off at those piggies? I know some would be angry at her for that, but me, I admire her guts. She sure picked a side!", "I may just be a gossiper, but even I know that if Vir licks Meepers ear while in the commons... that's something I'm going to talk about.

Do you think he's trying to start a fight to make work for the Sentinels?", "I hear Ramsford's been training a slave, in exchange for the slave tending some of his plants. Sounds like a smart deal to me, and good of him to help out others!", "The university not only teaches medicine, not only treats patients, but also supplies the slaves trained in healing with supplies. I know that hanging out in oldtown is likely to get me stabbed, but now I feel much more secure that a trained healer will be nearby to patch me up afterwards.", "I hear Lord Marcus has been meeting with the Doloreaux, to figure out what to do about that rat Rankin. I had no doubt that Lord Marcus would do the honorable thing, and protect the dignity of nobility.", "Is Luciano a mime now? You should catch his show, he'll mirror whatever a gentry is doing. And he'll call the piggies out as vigilantes. Hilarious! Hilarious, but shameful and inappropriate. Tisk, Luciano. Tisk tisk.", "Land Corporal Cullan is really a star! Someone's being rude, does he draw steel and crack heads? No! He speaks to them, then gets his gentry out of the commons and to somewhere more peaceful. Who says the Doloreaux are vigilantes? Land Corporal Cullan is a masterstudy in masculine restraint! And sexy, too.", "Ramsford, Ramsford, Ramsford. How long do you think the nobles will let your little business thrive, if you go around challenging their authority so publicly? It's not going to change things, either. They're honor-bound to retaliate.", "So Vir has been calling out the Pigs, when they fought back to avenge their honor. But didn't he do exactly the same thing? When Chinco punched his nose? Don't the pigs have much better reason for their actions than Vir did?", "Now Hush has join in criticizing the pigs. I hope the university doesn't rely on nobles for support. But I bet they will get better service from the constables.", "You know Constable Donatella? Yeah, she's not a constable, she just likes to act as if she is. I'm surprised she doesn't still wear the uniform.", "Disfavoring a character that was actually just a rumor...even if it is true...", "I overheard that pirates were upsetting seamstresses by making threats in the seamstress shop. And guess which slave was there. You'd think Gero's wife would keep him in line, instead of joining the trouble.", "Rank sticking with rank, how beautiful. I hear Gentleman Sattar stood up for Baronet Althalus and his attempt to get revenge on the pirate rat Rankin.", "That Lidia's more than willing to find someone who can make jewelry she can't if you want her to. She helped Ramsford make a special engagement ring for Brie, despite how complicated it was.", "Miss Kalda allows men to sit on her while she's lying down, and in public! That's not very appropriate behavior, if you ask me.", "Mister Mort enjoys lounging about on women who are lying down in public areas. Scandalous and inappropriate, I tell you!", "Since his last offenses, mister Chinco has again insulted House Doloreaux, and Lord Marcus personally. He carries arms in public, and even assaulted Sir Erwin! Jeez, man, get it together and learn from your mistakes already.", "Lady Grazia's Handmaid, Wynter, was heard giving advice to Handmaiden Inalla and Esquire Katrina about a Beauty Day, and it was good advice, too. It's so nice to see some of the House's working together.", "Esquire Lilandra understands the position of the commoners in her tiff with mister Rankin, and graciously has admitted that some of the concerns addressed on the public boards are valid. How gracious for a gentlewoman to accept the views of her lessers.", "Gentleman Sattar seems to be learning some manners, and how to be a proper gentleman. He has been seen acknowledging people, and is even more personable, offering cigars before lighting one for himself.", "Mister Rhys has been speaking his peace to the Doloreaux about the Rankin situation and his calling-out on the public boards. It's really something that he's putting forth the effort to soothe any offenses, and incredibly appreciated that he has offered escort to the gentlewomen of the house should they ever need it.", "I heard Veritas was overpaid by a hundred denarii for something, and he took the money back to the person who gave it to him. What an honest chap!", "I hear Mistress Meepers is helping Lady Grazia prepare all the outfits for the upcoming Comet's Fall Festival. Not uncommon for a seamstress to do, but she's handling all the oversight and fine tuning, too.", "Esquire Aysun is aiding the Rinaldi in preparing outfits for the Comet's Fall Festival. Yay for teamwork between the Houses!", "It's really sad that the Doloreaux seem to believe their honor is above the law of the city; laws set down by the Rinaldi, who have graciously offered to host the various' Houses embassies within their own quarters. Baronet Althalus blatantly told Lord Marcus that he and his House would have little faith in the Constabulary if the institution is unable to uphold their honor. Hopefully that doesn't mean the Doloreaux are going to be playing the part of vigilantes yet again.", "Lord Marcus called together a meeting of the nobility and various representatives of each house to discuss matters of the city and its law, and to determine what should be done in cases like the one between the Doloreaux and mister Rankin. It's quite pleasing that he took it upon himself as head of the Rinaldi to call everyone together for a group resolution.", "It's sad that the Baronet has such little faith and trust in city law and the people protecting it.  How can he expect the system to work if he bypasses it completely and doesn't encourage charges be pressed for a crime so that it can be brought before a magistrate? Many believe the system doesn't work because of individuals like him who deem to take the law into their own hands and ignore the systems put in place.", "Esquire Aysun seems to think that the word of a gentry woman is no more valuable than the word of a commoner. Gentry are honorable beings, and do not utter falsehoods which would demean their station.", "That Luciano sure likes to stir up trouble! He wanted to go and crash the Noble's meeting just because he was bored.", "I hear Luciano tried to get Rankin to go with him and cause some trouble for the Nobles during their fancy meeting. Surprisingly, mister Rankin resisted all the provocations and temptation.", "Interested in black magic? Well, Geradan's not, and if you ask him, he'll tell you that it's something to be shunned.", "Doctor Hush risked disfavor from the Doloreaux by publicly supporting Ramsford on the public boards. Wait .. didn't Baronet Althalus recently give her permission to court one of his own house members?", "People have no brains anymore. I hear that Virendra confessed to the commons that he used black magic on himself.", "Virendra's been prattling off about black magic, and how he tried it and failed. Who cares if the Church already knows? It's evil, and bad!", "Miss Lianaar is no fan of black magic, and she told Virendra there wasn't any excuse for using it. Suitable that she should be so appalled.", "Lord Marcus has been extending some of his duties to other members of the Rinaldi, and has been working on improving house relations, making people feel important and needed. Yay for delegation!", "Lord Twyrch apologized for the actions of his Squire in chastising Baronet Althalus and Sir Erwin, stating that she hadn't acted with full support of the House. It's a good thing to see Nobles taking responsibility for the actions of their house members and trying to right wrongs.", "Sir Ewrin avails himself to any noble in need, carrying packages and escorting Ladies to-and-fro. What a gentleman!", "Veritas helped carry a wounded Knight of the Avoirdupois to the infirmary, even after the house had dishonorably discharged him. He had class enough to help desite his persoal feelings and disagreements.", "I hear miss Amata knows how to speak sheep, and she'll teach you without asking anything for it in return.", "Mister Ramsford offered to teach a slave how to garden for free in exchange for her caring for some plants for an upcoming event. He didn't even wait long enough to learn that someone was willing to pay him for his trouble.", "Esquire Katrina is really good at ignoring taunts and not lowering herself to petty arguments in the commons. Shame on mister Luciano for trying to drag her down to his level!", "Sir Erwin has been engaging in unnecessary arguments with the likes of miss Elizabeth. He's a Noble, and is therefore always right in what he's saying, so there's no need for him to be lowering himself by bickering with commoners.", "Mister Ice likes to make fun of people's impairments in public. I heard he was teasing Sang about his hiss, and that's just completely impolite.", "I've never heard of such things .. but Ice apparently likes to go about kissing other men. How many different kinds of wrong can you be?", "Luciano has a love for imitations. He likes to mock Esquire Katrina for public entertainment, for example. Making fun of a gentrywoman? Probably not the best way to make a denar.", "Esquire Aysun is one smart cookie! She responded to declarations on the public boards in person to her Nobles, and managed to maintain a neutral stance in all disagreements, while still supporting the law of Triskellian.", "Esquire Cullan responded to his Noble's declaration on the public boards through missive, and agreed to abide by the stance to stay neutral in any disagreements stemming from the Doloreaux and Rankin subject.", "Luciano took to insulting Elizabeth in the commons, even going so far as to make suggestive remarks about how women are 'used'. We all know how women are useful, we don't need an itemized list of skills.", "Esquire Katrina went to Lord Marcus and told him why the Doloreaux really decided to attack Rankin, and assured him it wasn't a statement against the competency of the Constabulary. At least someone in the Doloreaux isn't attacking the law enforcement in this city.", "Sir Erwin let Lord Marcus know that Baronet Althalus does support the Constabulary, despite his decision to seek other means of justice. How can you really blame a Knight for defending the honor of his house?", "Gentleman Sattar was groping his wife's breast in the commons, talking about something nice and light. So much for his having progressed from previoius behavior. Groping in public is bad, mmkay.", "While her husband, Gentleman Sattar, was fondling her bosom inappropriately in the commons, Shaharazad just giggled at him and issued some playful swats in retaliation. That's an interesting way for a wife to discourage poor behavior, huh? I'm certain he felt sufficiently chided and discontinued his tasteless actions. Oh wait, no he didn't.", "If you think something is wrong with Esquire Lilandra, it's probably best not to ask. If you do, she'll tell you nothing, and then if you press her, she'll complain about how life is utterly unfair and her efforts are pointless. Here I thought gentry people were blessed by the Light, and not prone to being needlessly overdramatic.", "Esquire Aysun only supported the Contabulary during the meeting of the Great Houses and agreed that people need to respect and follows laws without exception. I bet the Rinaldi are just tickled purple to have the Bisclavret on their side.", "Sir Twyrch made it a point to smooth over issues with the Rinaldi concerning his house's Gentleman Sattar. I wonder how much more smoothing over will occur before the Bisclavret run out of ways to apologize.", "Mister Brenner tastelessly left in the middle of a courtesy lecture and even had the nerve to advertise his own session on courteous dueling before leaving without a bow or proper parting note. Some people!", "Mister Gegnar is always punctual when providing escorts for his house, and won't take any coin as compensation. The city needs more loyal folk like him around.", "Miss Aluine seems to think Miss Faile kills and beats slaves all day long, and thus must not be a follower of the Light. Faile was recognized by the church for her devotion to religion, and even if she hadn't been, there still wouldn't be anything wrong with her occupation. Slavery here is just as common as breathing air. It's such a shame that people like Aluine, who claim to be followers of the light themselves, are willing to judge others they don't know so swiftly.", "Baronet Althalus openly and publicly flouted the laws of Triskellian by creating a mob to track down the rat Rankin, without even reporting that a crime occurred to the Constabulary at all. It's disgraceful that a Noble would act in such a way, especially since so many look to people of rank for good examples.", "Gentleman Sattar's attitude has improved greatly as of late! He has been saying please, thank you, and even bids people Light's blessings. It's almost too good to be true ..", "What a gentleman Sir Brooks is. I heard he ordered a new outfit to attend Esquire Cerridwyn's debutant ball, and included a sash of periwinkle to match her dress and honor her family. Now that's how you win favor from the father of a woman you wish to marry.", "Mister Ice is still chasing boys for kisses in public. If you're interested in unique relationships, you at least ought to keep them private.", "Miss Taraji has a generous and giving spirit. She doesn't make much, but what she gets she shares with the beggars. Just look how heavy my pouch is, and it's partially thanks to her!", "That Esquire Katrina is great at communicating. She helped smooth over a conflict between Doctor Hush and the Doloreaux, even though she didn't have to, and she managed to do it before things escalated.", "Say what you will about Cincin's eccentricity, but she makes the best steeple hats in the city, and people love them!", "I hear Esquire Katrina is funding church sermons to try and improve the lives and attitudes of those in Docktown.", "Chinco's willing to teach other people's friends how to fish for free. Must be something up with the water in Docktown.", "More and more people are telling me about Gentleman Sattar's inappropriate and lewd behavior in the commons with his wife. I know they're married, but I'm surprised he would disrespect her and her body so openly, and that she would allow it.", "Esquire Katrina is at it again, swiftly reacting to a situation in which an ally of the Doloreaux unintentionally spoke against the house. Because of the Esquire's contact and conversation with said person, a stronger alliance was forged and all issues remedied.", "Ramsford's obvious fondness, devotion, and faithfulness to Brie is remarkable, and a rare case of how love can and should be in a city where love is a commodity.", "It seems mister Dylan uninvitedly gave input to students taking a gardening lesson, and when the teacher asked that he be able to do the teaching without interruption, the Dean left in a huff, complaining about being excluded. He didn't even pay attention to the invitation to join the group in the garden, but I guess that's how it goes.", "Miss Aluine enjoys preaching in public that slavery is evil. That sort of statement just entirely ignores the economical stand of society on the matter, and creates chaos while trying to ruin an institution that lives are built on.", "Tomoe is really good about helping out newcomers with starting materials and a list of contacts based on their interests.", "Miss Stuart, while being closely associated with mister Chinco, testified against him at the request of Lord Marcus. It's good to see that girl knows which side to pick when it comes to the law.", "That mister Swan is terrible with personal finance. I hear he's owed some lass ten denarii for weeks now and can't even scrape that much together. I guess being a sailor don't pay like it used ta.", "That Mini'll sleep with anyone. She's always dragging strangers to her bed, even married men, without any cares in the world.", "Mister Virendra swore to stop having mistresses and be faithful to his pregnant wife, but hes been seen slipping off with Minni regularly, and she's known to be the loose sort.", "If you're looking for an unabashed prostitute, miss Prudence is your girl. She'll try really hard to make you a customer!", "Miss Prudence has been spotted acting like a whore in the commons, being real suggestive with her body and verbal comments. Watch out boys!", "Sir Erwin is oh-so-attentive with Dame Grazia, escorting her everywhere since the start of their courtship, and upholding a shining display of decorum and propriety. Now there's an example people need to pay attention to!", "Either Miste Ice is completely loony, or honest to a fault. He went into the Docktown Chapel and proclaimed himself a lover of men and a former assassin. Can you imagine? I bet the priests just wanted to faint.", "Clergyman Ramses apparently overreacted to someone putting rubbish in the donation box, even threatening to call down the power of the Light on him! What a way to make people fear religion.", "Mister Dolon has shown a good understanding of the Light and of faith, and keeps well to his beliefs. He knows that S'allumer will always find a way to provide for his flock, and he's more than glad to tell you so.", "Surprise, surprise. Mister Ice is still trying to kiss on men in the middle of the commons. I'm actually pretty tired of talking about it. Suffice to say if you're a man and you seem him in the vicinity, be prepared.", "That miss Izzy sure doesn't care about public displays of affection and how uncomfortable they make others. People say she's been snuggling and kissing in full view of them, and they don't like it one bit!", "That Doctor Jahren sure doesn't care about public displays of affection and how uncomfortable they make others. People say hes been snuggling and kissing in full view of them, and they don't like it one bit!", "Doctor Hush made the case of House Doloreaux at the latest Guild Council meeting and explained how vile mister Rankin was. I guess it's good the Doloreaux have allies, but wasn't she just the ally of mister Rankin a week ago? Boy, people sure do confuse me.", "Mister Dylan is always stocking the tents with high quality fabrics and materials for low prices to help those crafters who can't acquire the goods themselves. It's right nice of him.", "Ryan is already making a good serf! I hear he brings Sir Brooks dinner on a regular basis, and that now that he can carry his own money, he doesn't need to be told to do the right thing, he just does them. That's proof that promotions work, and that he was deserving.", "Miss Izzy seems to think slaves have rights, which they don't. Shes also been criticizing the enforcers for doing their job, which don't make much sense at all. Can you imagine what kind of slaves we'd have without enforcers? I'm scared just thinking about it.", "Doctor Jahren interfered with the whipping of a slave and took Ryan away from the punishment he was about to receive just because he didn't think it was fair. Talk about stepping out of one's place. I'm sure the enforcers know what's fair and what isn't when it comes to slaves; that's their job after all.", "That Sheriff Joshua has done unending work for the Constabulary and has been capably handling some of mister Luciano's recent crimes. He should have been a horse so he could be referred to as a work horse! No, but seriously, he does a lot more than most people and doesn't get enough recognition for it.", "That miss Nuit had the nerve to step into the chapel without paying any respects whatsoever. She followingly was noisy and discourteous while others were praying, and further speaks negatively about the smaller building, comparing it in an unfavorable way to the Newtown Cathedral. It doesn't matter how beautiful a building is, it matters what's in the hearts of the people who occupy it.", "Mister Akash entered the Docktown chapel and failed to pay any sort of respects whatsoever. Afterward, he was noisy and discouteous while others were praying. If you want to chat and be loud, you don't go into a religious building to do it.", "Deputy Krell is quick and professional when taking testimonies. People are really appreciating that. Yay Constables!", "Miss Nuit agreed to train some of mister Veritas' employees, and saved him a load of money in the process. She was even modest enough to suggest the amount he offered in compensation was too much. So, if you're wanting some training and don't want to pay large sums, you should seek her out and see what kinda deal she'll offer.", "Mistress Meepers has shown constant attention to Lady Grazia, and has even been helping with handing out the rewards for the recent clothier's contest.", "People have been hearing Ryan speak out of his station about Gentleman Sattar, and how poor his behavior is. Regardless of whether it's true or not, slaves need to remember their place.", "Miss Elgin went along as a guard for the troupe that was celebrating Ryan's recent promotion. She even went so far as to provide money to buy pies so nobody had to walk back to the bank. What a good house member!", "If you ask Mistress Meepers to file a testimony to something she witnessed, she's right on it! She did so for Lord Marcus in a very prompt manner, which is always helpful.", "Mister Luciano has been making inappropriate comments to Avoirdupois Nobility, going so far as to tell them to take stools out of their behinds and get out of Docktown. He has even threatened violence, which isn't surprising, but is still unacceptable.", "More people are complaining about mister Luciano telling Sir Brooks and Sir Erwin to kiss his backside and sit on the stool rather than bedding it. What does that even mean anyway?", "Gentleman Sattar refused to give Sir Brooks an apology after he offended him, and even after Sir Erwin told him to. He pressed the offense by rattling off to the Noble about how his slave, Ryan, was undeserving of his recent promotion.", "Sir Erwin attempted to get Gentleman Sattar to apologize and behave appropriately to Sir Brooks after the gentleman was rude. Considering how often the Doloreaux and Avoirdupois are at odds, it's nice to see them stick up for each other on occasion.", "That slave Marcel has a nasty habit of cursing and talking inappropriately about people of a higher station, including Nobility and his own master, in front of random other people who outrank him. You'd think he'd have learned by now when to keep quiet.", "Luciano was in the commons making rude and lewd comments to miss Irene. When she retorted, he drew his blade and started threatening her, demanding she apologize. She didn't, and so he ended up stabbing her. Stabbing a woman in public! Can you imagine? And one who isn't even armed. What is the city coming to?", "Miss Lianaar is always generous and ever proper. I hear she gave Esquire Katrina some lovely new perfume for no reason at all other than to show some kindness.", "Miss Aluine claims that you can't be a devout follower of the Light when you are engaged in slave trading! Doesn't she know that slavery was supported by the Church from the very beginning?", "Apparently miss Lia thinks anybody who goes to be treated by Doctor Hush are either morons or they're sleeping with her, or both. I wonder what Doctor Hush thinks about a slave speaking of her that way?", "Mister Dylan has a knack for interrupting lessons and then trying to take them over, even if his opinion isn't invited. If you want to teach, it might be a good idea to get your own students.", "That Mister Dylan is something else! Even though Lia's only a slave, he took time out of his busy schedule to teach her about plants and herbs, and even spoke to the herb shop clerk so she'd get access to the back garden.", "Gentleman Sattar has been saying thank you to people lower ranked than him. Has he seen the Light? Is he ill? I don't know, but thank you is a good place to start rebuilding his reputation.", "Some of the recent gossip about mister Ice was incorrect. Apparently he never said anything negative in the chapel itself, just in the commons, which is still bad, but not as bad. I guess he has a little courtesy in him after all.", "Mister Ramsford's engagement party was said to be jolly good fun, and I hear it wasn't invite only, but everyone was encouraged to join and partake in goodies. How generous!", "That Miss Noire helped out a recently engaged fellow by counciling him through some worries he had about his lack of religion and how it will affect his relationship. She's real good about answering questions, or finding out necessary information to share with the people who need it. The Church sure is lucky to have folk like her.", "Mister Ramsford arranged for an open party with an elaborate selection of food and drinks. He even provided an opportunity for the people of Docktown to dance to music! Now that's something work speaking of.", "That Mister Kolgrim sure knows how to treat women and pamper them with all the proper pleasantries. If you dance with him, he'll really dish out the flattery.", "Don't know how to dance? Say it isn't so! Mister Bernard can teach you; in fact, he spent most of his time teaching people how to move rhythmically at a recent engagement party, which was right nice of him.", "Not only does he ask unsuspecting women to dance, but Mister Kolgrim also pays attention to them throughout their time together, engaging in conversation and treating them nicely.", "Mister Ramsford arranged a public event and invited all of the town to celebrate his engagement. He provided food and drinks, music, and a good mood!", "That Mister Ice sure can overreact! He got angry in the commons talking about miss Prudence and said that he was going to cut her into pieces! Well, at least the Constabulary knows who to blame if something happens to the lass.", "I heard miss Prudence went into the brewery and starting goading a girl into a fight, calling her a whore, and mocking her clothes. Heh. Takes one to know one, what?", "More talk about miss Prudence trying to pick fights and making people leave where they're socializing to avoid issues. At least if she's gonna be trouble she could do something different from time to time.", "Handmaiden Inalla sent one of her gentrywomen a new, pretty fan, completely of her own accord. That's the kind of generosity that moves you up in the world.", "People don't seem to honor Dimache much anymore, but Admiral Flynn went and prayed like a devout follower of the Light should.", "The Mistress honored Dimache by praying in the chapel, like all devout followers of the Light should.", "Miss Naomi refused to pray in the chapel, panicked when she entered the holy building, and then fled before she said any prayers at all. Kinda makes you wonder, huh?", "Mister Jace honored Dimache by praying in the chapel, like all devout followers of the Light should.", "Miss Noire honored Dimache by praying in the chapel, like all devout followers of the Light should.", "Have you heard that Brie gives a discount for regular customers? I wish I could buy clothes often enough to be considered a regular.", "Do you know that the Rainbow Rags offer free clothes for new arrivals in the city? Yeah, if you meet a new person, just check the racks in the seamstress shop to find clothes for them. That Brie works hard to keep them stocked.", "I hear that Lady Grazia is quite pleased with how Xena stepped up to take care of the tournament and festival while she was away.", "You know, all the best people patron the arts. Xena is stepping up as well, commissioning a new statue for the city.", "Man, that Xena again. Standing up to Baronet Althalus, and taking him to task for assuming that the legal system should just automatically assume nobles are in the right. I know they trust nobles words more than ours, but I'm glad we're not instantly assumed to be guilty! Thanks to people like Xena fighting for the law. I bet she's glad she works for the Rinaldi, and not to Doloreaux about now.", "Did you hear that Esquire Lilandra first said that she didn't recognize her attacker? And now says it was Rankin? It seems to me that either she was told to say it was Rankin, or else she was too afraid in the first place to say who attacked her. Either way, I feel for the poor woman.", "Have you seen that muscular leopard around? Looking so fancy in his constabulary uniform? And now turning up to represent the constables. Now there's a man on the up-and-up.", "Have you heard what Sir Erwin said? He said he didn't care what trouble would come from going after Rankin, and he only cared about the safety of his house members. And that he'd accept whatever punishment that awards him. Now, that.", "Have you heard what Sir Erwin said? He said he didn't care what trouble would come from going after Rankin, and he only cared about the safety of his house members. And that he'd accept whatever punishment that awards him. Now, that's truly knightly behavior!", "Everyone heard about the meeting that Marcus organized. Getting all four houses and the constables together, and handling all the issues that came up. Move over, Don We've got a new Rinaldi diplomat!", "Brie tells me that Mister Rhys always pays bills on time. And here I was thinking that this city ran on debt...", "So, I walk into the boarding house lounge, and what do I see? A male rabbit. Sitting on top of some woman. Ugh! There are plenty of other chairs, or could have borrowed some from the severed tail if they'd run out.", "Did you hear? Esquire Katrina is sponsoring Xena? But only if she continues to hold the courtesy lectures. Smart move, Katrina. Now all the courtesy lectures are being held by the same group of people. The power! The control! What if they start telling everyone to wear pants on their heads? I bet it'd be the next fashion.", "Mister Ramsford is such a romantic! He got down on one knee when proposing to Brie. It's just like a fairytale!", "Need a wedding ring? Lidia's the girl for you!", "Does Taraji work for the church? I hear she's been giving money to the beggars.", "Mister Dylan helped gather healing supplies to aid the Doctors in treating people injured by the fire. Extra hands and extra helpers are always good.", "You hear that Virendra admitted that he was having affairs with \\"ladies\\", when he thought Maddy had run off on him? I know everyone has affairs, but you'd think that, for the sake of decency, he'd just lie and claim he was chaste.", "Sir Bayard is such a brave Knight! He charged right into the Severed Tail to assist with putting out the fire. No other Nobles were anywhere in sight.", "Enunciation is a good thing; unfortunately, miss Taraji only knows how to enunciate improper words like 'ass'. You shouldn't walk around calling people that, nope. It's the rudeness.", "Esquire Cerridwyn will make a fine wife. She shows proper modesty, or so I'm told. Not like all these commoner women.", "I hear that Brie is friends with some slaves, and offered to pay their masters to cover their work for the evening, so the slaves would be free to attend her engagement party.", "That Ofello Behr is one brave soul! I hear he ran straight into the blazing Severed Tail to aid Sir Bayard who was trying to put out the flames. See? You don't have to be part of a House to do the right and proper thing.", "What's that grizzly's name? Dylan? After the fire at the Severed Tail, he went running around gathering healing supplies for the Doctors while they were busy with all of the injured. I bet they really appreciated the extra help.", "Miss Nuit was out and about tending to the injured after the fire in the Severed Tail. I don't know if she's a healer or not, but it sure was swell of her to help out anyway.", "What is with Lions in this city? With one notable example, they seem to have no manners at all. Take that Akash, making comments at Miss Xena about how she's boring and he only likes her for her looks. And continually interrupting her because he's not paying attention during courtesy lessons. I wonder if lions know what the word \\"Ironic\\" means?", "Caliste is one polite slave! She even wrote a note to Dean Dylan apologizing for Ryan and Ramsford's behavior. I wonder if those two know she's apologizing for them, and I wonder what they'd think about it. Maybe they'd appreciate it, maybe they'd be annoyed, maybe Caliste sometimes forgets she's no longer gentry. But Dean Dylan seems happier now, so that's good.", "Doctor Jahren kept cozy in his line of work and helped tend to the injured after the fire in the Severed Tail was put out. Glad to know there was a trained medic on site.", "Seems lots of people appreciated miss Nuit helping out with the injured from the recent fire. It's so heart-warming to know the city is full of such caring and helpful people.", "Did you hear that Caliste managed to get Flynn to take a bath. I don't mean just washing his hears, but actually totally getting into the water. I wish more sailors had slaves that would make them bathe.", "Miss Opal was amongst the many helping tend to injured persons after the fire in the Severed Tail. Whew, sounds like patients had more than enough attention this time.", "Did you hear that Caliste managed to get Flynn to take a bath. What's more, Flynn then wore the clothes that Caliste had brought, and thanked her afterward. Being a yeoman has certainly improved his manners.", "That Mister Bernard managed to hurl a barrel of water at the fire in the Severed Tail when a team of people tried before him and couldn't manage. What a big help, and wow, those muscles!", "Doctor Jahren was really good about promptly seeing to the medical needs of people hurt in the Severed Tail fire. I guess that's why he's a doctor, eh?", "Talk about brisk! Miss Opal was flitting here and there, promptly seeing to the medical needs of people afflicted by the Severed Tail fire.", "That miss Noire ran and bought an overpriced barrel of water to put out the fire in the Severed Tail! I hope she knows that her generosity was appreciated and that the lives she helped save are priceless.", "Ryan was running back and forth gathering water to put out the Severed Tail fire with. It's a good thing bunnies are great and fast hoppers!", "Jahren is a true doctor, thinking on the future of the town. I hear he kept doses of spider itch cures, so when Flynn obtained it, the cure was at hand before the plague got out of hand again.", "Surely you've seen that Prudence female milling about. I hear she recieved a brand-spanking-new outfit from Miss Brie, and how was she repayed? With a scroll saying she forgot the stockings! How rude is that?", "Ryan risked his life trying to help extinguish the fire raging in the Severed Tail. He might just be a serf, but it still takes bravery to act like he did.", "A married man should mind his reputation, and bring no shame to his wife. Allowing women to kiss his jaw in public is certainly not the way to go about it.", "Aun unmarried woman should mind her reputation. Kissing married men, such as Flynn, on their jaw in public is certainly not the way to go about it.", "Mister Bernard was amonst the many who risked his life trying to help put out the fire in the Severed Tail. I bet all the people sleeping cozily in their rooms are thanking him as much as the people who saw him in action are!", "Mister Ramsford risked his life trying to help extinguish the fire that raged through the Severed Tail. It looks like hiim and many others will get to see another day thanks to his bravery!", "One of the ways not to woo a woman is to tell her that you have a friend that smells worse than she does. Someone should tell that to Kolgrim.", "Mister Leif gallantly offered to escort Dame Valara of the Avoirdupois about town to ensure her safety. Now that's a good and proper guard.", "I hear mister Bruno let mister Ofello take over his guild and either didn't bother to mention that certain members were being trained, or actively supported removing the ability of certain members to better their craft. Either way, that doesn't seem like good business, taking away people's means of progressing in their field after they have committed themselves to working for you.", "What sort of gentleman purposefully insults an Avoirdupois Knight? And if that wasn't the worse part, when a Doloreaux suggested he apologize, Sattar gave the stink-eye to Sir Brooks and claims to owe him no apology.", "Mister Ofello apparently took over the Hands of St. Trahern and his first order of business was to completely cut out pay and the ability to train with the teachers. He didn't even send out courtesy notes to his members to inform them of what was going on! People are starting to whisper that the guild is just using them to bring in money without offering any benefits. Oh my, that doesn't bode well.", "That Miss Brie is the role model of all young ladies in the city. If everyone valued their relationships and their partner as much as she does, the world would be a perfect place.", "Any new arrivals needing help adjusting to city life don't have a thing to worry about, with Caliste on the job. The best part is, she will be discreet about it.", "People are starting to believe Ice is insane. He giggles randomly in important conversations, wanders around aimlessly .. oh! And he claims to work for the church, while also being an ex-assassin who likes to self-admittedly bed men. Is it just me, or does it sound like the church will hire just about anyone these days?", "A small group of people were talking about a church member who had been acting sinful and insane. Miss Tomoe simply got up and walked out of the conversation without a concern at all about the church, a fellow church member, or preserving the ideals of S'allumer. This is supposedly a woman who works for the Faith! The nerve!", "Did you go to Miss Brie's and Mister Ramsford's engagement party? Neither did I, but I heard it was a hoot. There were free food and drinks, music, and a friendly atmosphere.", "That Sir Brooks is something else, in a good way! Sheriff Joshua was stressing out a bit about his upcoming promotion ceremony, and the Avoirdupois Knight sat all evening in the lounge helping him write up a speech. That's such a selfless sacrifice of precious time.", "What an engagement party that was! Not only was there an elaborate selection of food and drinks, it was open to the town and there was an opportunity to dance the night away!", "Even after mister Luciano insulted Esquire Katrina and got off with a warning, he contined to insult Sir Erwin and Sir Brooks, and even assaulted mister Veritas and miss Irene. There is just no end to this man's recklessness and poor behavior!", "The engagement party miss Brie and mister Ramsford held was jolly good fun! There was dancing, food--REALLY good food, drinks, and a lot of socializing! And they didn't even make it invite-only, everyone was encouraged to join! How generous of them!", "Esquire Katrina is so patient. She'll wait for the attention of freeman who have other things to do than tend to her, and she'll do it without complaint!", "Did you hear that if miss Xena really likes you, she'll give you a sound smack? I hope she doesn't start liking me anytime soon!", "That Caliste slave really is something special! She risked her life trying to help put out the fire in the Severed Tail, then even stayed behind to clean the place up!", "Bunnies aren't the only ones that can bounce around when on a mission. Caliste dashed to and from the Severed Tail, ferrying water in to help put out the blaze. Aren't we all lucky to have such useful slaves around?", "Did you hear about when Veritas stepped up and defended a woman Luciano was harassing and making lewd comments to? It's a good thing there are still a few decent men around.", "Can you believe Mister Cullan covered up for his housemate Gentleman Sattar and apologized for any offenses he may have caused? If you ask me, Gentleman Sattar is really lucky there are some in his House that are willing to pick up his slack. If I were Cullan, I wouldn't have bothered.", "That Luciano is up to no good as usual. I heard he found a group of people in the brewery patio, one of them being Sir Brooks, and said aloud that the Avoirdupois need to take the stools out of their.. rears. How tasteless!", "The slaves under Doctor Hush's ownership have it good. To celebrate Ryan's promotion to serfdom, Hush and Sir Brooks gave him enough money to buy everyone drinks, then they said toasts and offered kind words of praise for all his hard work and efforts. It's no wonder Ryan is behaving better with owners like that.", "Mister Ramsford is very inclusive with people, even if they've take offense to something he's said in the past.", "I heard that despite her close relationship with Chinco, that she testified against him on his charge. Smart of her to go with Lord Marcus on that one, appropriate too.", "Not only was she rude enough to eavesdrop on other peoples' conversations, Tomoe shows absolutely no initiative whatsoever in resolving problems. It's little wonder the people are starting to lose faith in the city clergy.", "That Prudence woman must be dying for attention, going around touching men without permission, then continuing to do so even after being told to stop. Just what is her problem?", "Did you hear that Brenner hosted his own courtesy class? Only unlike Xena's, it was about courteous dueling, which isn't something the general populace appears to be educated in. At least he is stepping up and doing something productive and beneficial to the city.", "I heard Ofello and Bruno Smith donated a heap of weapons, armors and shields to the Rinaldi to thank them for their hospitality and alliance with their guild. How generous of the two of them.", "I heard Bruno Smith and Ofello donated a heap of weapons, armors and shields to the Rinaldi to thank them for their hospitality and alliance with their guild. How generous of the two of them.", "That Ice sure has a filthy mouth! He threatened to cut Prudence to pieces, only referring to Prudence as.. well.. a really horrible name. Use your imagination!", "Miss Lianaar is incredibly thoughtful! While everyone else brought gifts only for the bride-to-be at Brie and Ramsford's engagement party, she was the only one who gave them a gift as a couple. And if that wasn't enough, she gave an entire speech dedicated to wishing them well in their future. How great is she!", "Cincin came bearing gifts to Brie and Ramsford's engagement party, but these gifts had meaning behind them. Couldn't tell you what they were, I didn't ask. She also gave them wise advice to follow while going into marriage.", "Isn't the purpose of Xena's courtesy classes to learn how to be courteous? That's what I thought, so why would someone attend and purposefully be rude? Someone should ask that Vincent fellow.", "I heard Ramsford attended Xena's courtesy lesson for the first time, the one about business and such, I think. He asked questions and involved himself in the discussion, which was very beneficial to the rest in attendance. I'm glad more and more people are feeling humble enough to accept improvement.", "A supposed man of the light, mister Gizzard walked through a courtesy gathering and said Light keep you safe, heaven knows you all need it. Religion is hard enough without people being so passingly judgmental.", "Did you hear? Admiral Flynn went crazy at Xena's courtesy meeting! Well, crazy may be stretching it, but he kept focusing on things that weren't there, then exclaiming that he was going to kill someone. In his defense though, one of the merchants told me something might have been slipped into his drink.", "Serfdom doesn't appear to be going to Ryan's head! You should have seen him, like a lightning bolt, carrying water to the Severed Tail to help put out the fire. Still as dutiful as he was when he was a slave.", "Have you heard of Mac? He valiantly assisted in the extinguishing of the fire in the Severed Tail! He sure made the Doloreaux look good with that, methinks.", "Ofello isn't just good for smithing weapons. You can count on him if another fire breaks out to jump in and lend a hand.", "Did you hear that the Spider Itch reared its ugly head again? But don't worry, it was swiftly dealt with. Ryan applied it to Admiral Flynn to cure him, risking getting infected himself. What a good example of self-sacrifice!", "Bad attitude or not, at least Vincent showed up to the courtesy lecture, which is more than what many others do. Whether or not he learned anything, though, is still unknown.", "Ryan treated Admiral Flynn for the spider itch at risk to himself. Awwz, what a good brother he is.", "Seen Noire at the courtesy lectures. She's quite the lady.", "Admiral Flynn selflessly refused medical care for himself until after the fire in the Severed Tail was safely put out. Lets just hope nobody got spider itch whie he was waiting for treatment.", "Admiral Flynn does a great job keeping all the slaves under his charge in line and well disciplined. At the same time he is very forgiving and reasonable when dealing with unruly slaves who are really apologetic. Hopefully he doesn't get too soft though, don't want the slaves thinking they can get away with everything.", "Did you hear that Admiral Flynn refused medical care until the fire was put out? I guess it comes from being a sailor, where a fire onboard threatens everyone.", "You heard that slave, Ryan, talk about his mother? With the most foul language! I'm sure it's true, but still... trust a slave to say it out loud.", "Xena is being promoted, but why is she going to the Bisclavret for a sponsor? Don't the Rinaldi have anyone appropriate?", "You know how Zoe is always punctual with her carpentry work? I hear on the odd occasions when she's running late she also gives discounts.", "I'm told that Cullan is helpful to nobles. But I have no idea what he does for them...", "Zoe helped donate items for the upcoming auction. What item? Attend the auction and see!", "Only nodding to gentry and even knights? Yeah, that's not really polite. But Chesh is just a freedman, so I don't think anyone cares too much, heaps of freedmen don't bother bowing. Even if they should. At least Chesh nodded to them.", "You heard about Chesh just nodding to knights? Yeah, I know, nobody really expects different since Chesh is just a freedman. But Veritas? Sometimes he barely even nods. Why should we care about Veritas and not Chesh? I guess we shouldn't, but I hear that he's going to get promoted soon. Maybe he'll start being more formal when he's a yeoman.", "I hear that even other slaves are complaining about Eldro, how he never helps clean the trash and how his mistress always coddles him. Ha! At least now the slaves are bitching about someone other than Marcel.", "Heard about Prudence... uh... propositioning men in public? Isn't it normally the men propositioning the women? At least, that's how it should be if you ask me!", "Isn't it nice when new arrivals to the city make an effort to earn what they are given? This one guy named Kildarien was actually mugged on his way to town, but instead of being mopey about his bad luck and accepting freebies, helped Ramsford run errands in exchange for coin.", "That mister Cullan is not only a dutiful and proper member of the Bisclavret, he is quite the gentleman! In addition to checking in with Countess Aedina to make sure she is well and not in need of anything, he offered to heft a heavy instrument around for her. How nice!", "Ryan is really helpful, if you have questions regarding promotions. Why, just the other day, he was coaching Caliste on how to handle promotions, going so far as to suggest names for potential sponsors. Does that mean Caliste is going to get promoted soon? It's almost a shame, she is such a good slave.", "That Leif needs to keep his private and public lives separate! No one wants to watch him display intimacy with his woman, has he no shame?", "You'd think that with the recent promotion to yeoman, Doctor Hush would display a little more taste when out in public and discussing business with others. She just up and allowed Leif to lick her ear, it's outrageous!", "Did you see what Leif did, right in the middle of the commons? He licked Doctor Hush's ear while she was in a conversation with someone! Not only is that rude, it's gross!", "I heard from a sailor that he saw Leif licking Doctor Hush's ear, right in public, while she was engaged in business with someone. Not only that, she didn't even bother to correct him UNTIL she saw the negative reaction it got. She is going to have to step it up, now that she isn't a commoner anymore.", "At least Doctor Hush had the sense to reprimand Leif for his display of unacceptable public affection.", "I heard from the milk maid who heard from the baker who heard from a passing merchant that when Hush reprimanded Leif for his behavior, she only did it to appease the other people present, and that Leif just smirked at her. At least she did something about it, but she is going to have to keep him in line.", "Did you hear? Miss Opal did a real good job taking care of those victims from the fire in the Severed Tail. Her initiative is commendable, what with her being new to healing and all.", "Mister Chinco went to church just to let everyone know he's capable of beating up S'allumer, and is just waiting for him to show his face. If S'allumer brought on a fight, I have a feeling it would be more along the lines of wiping someone out of existence rather than playing swords. Going into a holy building to talk trash is just unacceptable behavior, no matter how ridiculous the statement mister Chinco made was.", "Chinco, Chinco, Chinco. He encouraged people to attend mass by telling them to get in the damn church, and then made comments implying holy areas should be desecrated. If that wasn't enough disrespect, he stuck around for all of Mistress Meepers' prayer service, being generally disruptive and rude.", "Mister Ramsford was helpful in organizing and advertising Mistress Meepers' prayer service, and politely reminded people to attend on her behalf. What a good go-to boy he is.", "Mistress Meepers took time out of her busy schedule and trekked all the way to the Newtown arena to inform the Bisclavret nobles and a few others that she was holding a prayer service for the people who were victims of, and fought against, the fire in the Severed Tail. Being thoughtful really can take you places.", "Sir Bayard risked his health as a Noble to save the Severed Tail and its guests during a recent fire. He was badly injured during the process, but continued with extinguishing efforts regardless. Now that's behavior representative of a Knight.", "Sir Bayard bravely fought the fire in the Inn, sustaining burn injuries from his efforts. Acting selflessly really has got him a lot of recognition lately.", "When Meepers organized a prayer meeting for victims and fighters of the recent fire, mister Ramsford went out of his way to go around town announcing the event, and even put up a public notice for her. Sharing information is a great way to get recognized.", "Mistress Meepers took initiative and organized a prayer meeting for those injured in the fire. I'm sure the church folk will agree it was very pious of her to do so.", "Did you know Meepers organized a prayer meeting? If you didn't, where have you been?! She went to a lot of trouble to personally invite people and have it be a noteworthy event to thank those who fought the fire in the Severed Tail, and those who suffered from it.", "Meepers is being recognized all over for her recent prayer session honoring those who fought the Inn's fire, and sending warm wishes to the injured. I just don't even know how much more I can say about it, to be honest.", "Mister Teros and mister Ice were spotted kissing each other in the Docktown park area, and they're both men! How utterly inappropriate for a public place.", "Doctor Hush might have allowed Leif to cozy up to her in the commons at first, but she swiftly realized it was making people uncomfortable, and followingly told Leif to stop engaging in such inappropriate behavior. Time and place is everything; I'm glad she came to see that, too.", "I heard mister Leif was expressing bodily affection to Doctor Hush in the commons. Even if they're courting, that's just unacceptable behavior in a public area. He needs to think about how his actions reflect upon her too.", "That Kildarien fellow is really thoughtful! Why, I heard he took a full meal to Veritas, who was very busy all day. At this rate, he is going to put a lot of wives out of work!", "You know, brides-to-be can go really nuts. I hear Dahlia was in tears about the wedding preparations, so Brie offered to take them over. Which Dahlia agreed to, but then two days before the wedding Dahlia started making her own plans, and ignoring the work Brie had done. I tell you, those brides, they be crazy! Best to just avoid them entirely until the day of the wedding.", "I thought Baronet Althalus supported the Constabulary? Maybe not. He recently questioned Sheriff Joshua when getting arrested, demanding to see documentation on the arrest procedure. That's not the best way to get brownie points.", "Seems Sheriff Joshua has been getting a little rough recently while arresting Nobility. Baronet Althalus claims he was treated like a common ruffian by the Sheriff, despite the assurance that he wouldn't present any problems to the Constabulary officer. I guess the Baronet was hoping to go cuff free and get some special treatment due to his rank.", "Miss Prudence has been acting like a whore again in public, and followingly gets aggressive when people make a verbal note of her behavior. If you don't want people to see you for what you are, then perhaps some different behavior is appropriate when in crowds.", "That miss Danae sure is doing a good job of taking initiative and organizing the citizen's militia. I bet the number of complaints about available Constabulary members dwindles with the extra hands around to help out.", "Bayard is doing his part in supporting the Constabulary by joining the citizen's militia, so that any actions he takes to defend his House are legal. I heard he was incredly patient in exercising his newfound power when arresting mister Chinco, too.", "Despite having had multiple opportunies, mister Bayard still hasn't acknowledged mister Veritas' help in carrying him to the infirmary following his heart attack. Whether or not you get along with someone, it's generally polite to thank them when they have aided in saving your life, especially when you have previously gone out of your way to damage said person's reputation and standing and they helped regardless.", "Scandalous! Miss Dahlia was seen entering her private room alone with a man who wasn't her husband, and she didn't even acknowledge the Nobility she passed by while in this other man's company. Hasn't she only been married like a day?", "I heard miss Brie arranged for the Rinaldi to rent out the College in Newtown for miss Dahlia's wedding reception, and a day before the wedding Dahlia informed her that she had found some place else to hold the festivities, putting miss Brie in a very bad spot with the Rinaldi. I can't imagine being so inconsiderate to a guild mate.", "That slave Sigfried is really good about asking people if they need anything when he's around. Just the other day he went and grabbed a multitude of beers at the request of some people in the commons and promptly and properly handed them out. Uncomplaining and eager to serve, that's the kind of slave everyone wants.", "Mister Jace sent the slave Sigfried on an errand to get beer for everyone in the commons, and then let the slave have one too as a reward. That's the way to make slaves feel useful and appreciated.", "Despite being an owned slave, Sigfried is very helpful and obedient to anyone above his station. He'll serve drinks or do anything that doesn't go against the rules of his master, and is ever kind, polite, and proper without questioning people about the tasks given to him.", "Mister Bayard risked life and limb alongside the commoners when putting out the fire in the Severed Tail, even aiding so much as to take serious injury. Despite this, he refused treatment until all other wounded were tended to. His fortitude and dedication should be an example to all following an officer's path.", "How valorous it was of mister Bayard to charge at the fire in the Severed Tail with no regard for his own safety.", "That miss Prudence certainly has some audacity. I hear she threw wine in Mistress Pru's face when the carpenter tried to escort her from the wedding reception she wasn't invited to.", "Miss Prudence decided to waltz in on a wedding reception and be rude to the guests, and even ruder to the bride and groom! Who is going to teach this girl some manners?", "People are still boggling over miss Prudence having thrown wine in mistress Pru's face. I bet the pretty Pruessus was just livid!", "When the groom of a wedding asks you to leave a reception you weren't initially invited to, you should go. Apparently miss Prudence is unaware of the discourtesy she showed by refusing to leave mister Dune's wedding party when he requested it.", "Showing up uninvited to a party is rude. Refusing to leave a party when asked is even worse than rude, and being mean and hateful is just not appropriate regardless of where you are. Miss Prudence managed to do all these things in one day without even blinking.", "Miss Prudence showed up at miss Dahlia and mister Dune's wedding reception uninvited. When asked to leave, she refused and continued to partake in refreshments that were meant for the guests stating that the park wasn't owned by the couple and their party occupying it. Why would you try to ruin someone's wedding day, honestly?", "Mistress Meepers helpfully assisted miss Danae with an investigation into the possible arson attack on the Severed Tail. I hear she gave a list of witnesses, and a variety of leads for the Constabulary member to pursue. Cooperating with the law is a sure way to get recognized in this city; the Mistress has the right idea.", "Miss Danae has been busy investigating and diligently pursuing whomever potentially set the fire in the Severed Tail. People are commending her for her efforts.", "After Doctor Hush chided mister Leif for licking her ear in public, she turned around and started licking his jaw in the commons! Gah .. don't these people learn anything?", "Doctor Jahren did a fantastic job of tending to the injured after the Severed Tail fire. Mister Bayard even commented he would make him his personal physician if he wasn't so valuable an asset to the city as a whole. Ahh, to have good medical care is invaluable.", "Mister Bayard got harmed attempting to fight a fire in the Severed Tail. If putting himself in harm's way to protect others isn't a virtue worth commending, I don't know what is.", "Esquire Aysun is a pillar of fashion, always being nicely dressed with an orderly appearance, and displaying appropriate manners  to match.", "I hear mister Veritas gifted Countess Aedina with a unique harp recently, and distracted her from being upset over incidents regarding her house. Buying the favor of a Noble with material goods, ahh, the sweetness of it.", "Did you hear? Esquire Aysun went into a private room... with a chaperone. It shouldn't be amazing, but so few people take a chaperone with them when they are going to be in private with a member of the opposite sex. Remember, You and Me and Chaperone makes Three.", "I hear that Miss Xena is willing to chaperone when people of rank will be in private together. She's certainly got the social respect to be a good chaperone.", "I heard from my friend's cousin who heard from her husband who works as a butler with the Bisclavret that Lord Twyrch hates doing paperwork, and Esquire Aysun picks up the slack. I still don't reckon nobles work nearly as hard as us commoners. How can they when they spend all their time gossiping instead of working. Speaking of which, that reminds me about this story I have to tell... you'll never believe what the Rinaldi chambermaid told the chimney sweep...", "Have you seen the new furniture that Esquire Aysun has been given? A gift for Lord Twyrch to recognize her hard work.", "Is Yeoman Veritas now working for the Avoirdupois? I hear he's been going into private rooms with their slave.", "Need a dummy to beat on? Kildarien will gladly volunteer his own body for spars if you have students to teach combat techniques to.", "That Esquire Katrina sure is a S'allumer loyalist. Apparently she wants the Inquisition to be more forceful, and to make public examples of those who spurn the Light. I bet Presbyter Ximen is just giddy with that encouragement .. frightening!", "Having a party, but don't want to clean up the mess afterward? Hire on mister Fyros. I hear even if you leave goods of value behind he'll return them without a second thought.", "Despite all of Esquire Aysun's duties, she still sets aside time to pray on Dimache like a good follower of S'allumer should. It's no wonder the Light has showered her with so many blessings.", "That carpenter squirrel, Irene? Shes been giving a lot of gracious discounts lately to people on furnishings so they can spruce up their homes. A whole room for twenty denarii? Psh. Sign me up.", "The Rinaldi's newly inducted miss Lianaar has agreed to serve as a mediator between the Doloreaux and Constabulary. She has been gentle and understanding with the Doloreaux embassy and is giving them sound advice on how to kiss and make up with the law guild. That's the sort of person every house should be looking to employ.", "Esquire Katrina hasn't given up on soothing bad feelings between the Doloreaux and the Constabulary. She's being proactive and cooperative with the Rinaldi trying to clear out the air on behalf of her embassy.", "Mister Rhys has embraced the spirit of giving, turning over a new violin to the University for it's music students.", "Miss Shade isn't very discrete about her entertaining of men. She was hanging all over Caelith in the commons the other day and then stepped out into the boarding house lounge where he passed through a few moments later and led her toward the guest hall. It doesn't take a genius to fit the pieces together.", "That miss Minni is ridiculously bold in her promiscuous propositioning of men. They have a cathouse for people interested in that kind of work, don't they? Someone needs to give her directions.", "Esquire Katrina sure does promise a lot of things: contracts regarding meteors, courtesy lectures and church sermons. Have you noticed she rarely follows through on those promises? Yah, even her courtesy sessions only lasted for a few bouts, and that doesn't even require organization with anyone but herself. Gentry people should know better than to make promises they cannot keep since their word is worth more than the word of many.", "Mister Grimclaw always acts with discipline and professionalism when carrying out his duties as Veritas' Lieutenant. If you need a soldierly sort, maybe you can see if he can be hired out?", "Miss Taraji proved she can follow orders from her commanding officers and act with discipline during one of the Sentinel's recent contracts. Despite that she lacks extensive formal training as a soldier, she still gives 100%.", "However rough around the edges some might call Mister Rhys, he is quite the gentleman. Whether asked or not, he'll happily escort women of breeding throughout the cities and alleys and ensure them safely to their intended destination. What a good Yeoman he's turning out to be.", "Nyx is good at testing blah blah blahs.", "Sergeant Danae has been actively working to set up the citizen's militia. Her hard work definitely deserves some recognition.", "Azrael is good at testing blah blah blahs too!", "If you're going to be a criminal, at least don't be a pest. Mister Chinco recently wasted the Constabulary's time after being arrested by walking slowly, generally stalling, and being irritating. If you're gonna do the crime, be prepared to walk swiftly to your fate. The lawpeople don't like stragglers.", "Mister Mac is doing his civic duty and has joined the citizen's militia. What a good choice for a house guard to make.", "Mister Cullan has decided to join the citizen's militia on behalf of the Bisclavret Embassy. What a good guy, doing his civic duty.", "Miss Taraji apparently gave her jewelry to a parrot named Belle. Even though it was an act of somewhat unwilling kindness, she could have reacted far worse to it. She did a good job of maintaining her composure while the bird snatched her things.", "Miss Lianaar offered to mediate between Sheriff Joshua and Baronet Althalus with their current disagreement, appearing impartial and listening and understanding concerns on both sides. I hear she's a woman very conscious of propriety too, rising when her superiors do, and waiting to sit until they sit. What an asset she is to the city, aiding in such capacities.", "Mister Rhys comported himself professionally and controlled his soldiers well during an outing to parley with Seaweed Joe. Others in attendance were appreciative of his leadership abilities.", "Lord Marucs sure is an understanding Noble. He listened to Baronet Althalus' concerns regarding the Sheriff and attempted to assist in finding a resolution for everyone without impuning on anybody's honor. Tact and delicacy are fantastic traits in a leader, and are definitely useful tools in diplomacy.", "Did you hear? Ryan has been helping Doctor Hush's new students by proffering himself as a patient to be practiced on. People are even saying he got his finger dislocated for the sake of education. Wow, what a dedicated and obedient person he's turned into since serfdom.", "Did you notice Ryan gets a little jealous when his master, Doctor Hush, gives attention to soemone else? To retaliate he tries to act fond of different people too, but unfortunately he forgets to think about whether they might get into trouble or not.", "Even after being warned about mister Ice and his aggressive attempts to kiss other men, mister Zev was seen going into a private room with him. I guess warnings don't mean anything to some people, or maybe he just isn't worried about Ice's romantic inclinations. It isn't terribly inappropriate for people of the same gender to be in rooms together, but his judgement is still questionable.", "Not only did Virendra cheat on his wife after swearing to be faithful this time, but when his wife found out and left him, he went and found the lass he slept with and beat her half to death for sleeping with a married man. It's a shame we dont have a place for the crazies in Triskellian..", "Meepers sure is unorganized. One of her customers came complaining that she crammed all their new clothing into a package without separating one outfit from another, leaving them with what looked like a colorful load of laundry.", "Mister Styre and miss Elizabeth have been seen entering private rooms together, and both have declined the offer of a chaperone. Now what could two people being doing alone in a room that they don't want others witnessing? Think, think, think.", "Ryan has been engaging in random acts of kindness, giving some of his own clothes to a recent newcomer in Triskellian.", "Boy, that Ryan! He was generous enough to give a newcomer some brand new clothes. Doctor Hush sure must be a good master, raising her slave to act so nicely.", "How many times do people need to be chided for fighting in public areas? Mister Virendra caused a scuffle in the infirmary, and refused to leave until after the guards gave him a good kick in the behind.", "How rude! Mister Ice was heard saying he wants to slaughter miss Prudence. Even if you feel that way, you shouldn't talk about it in public. Slaughter isn't a polite word.", "Mister Ekalah saw some fighting in the commons and as a way to show disapproval refused to make a dagger for one of the people involved in the scuffle. I guess at least they still have their fists to hurt each other with.", "Talk about adding insult to injury. After miss Madalina beat up miss Prudence in a fight, she followingly struck her across the face! Women sure can be brutal..", "Baronet Althalus is back to insulting the Sheriff. It's a good thing there are people like Sir Brooks around to be supportive of the law while still being polite and honorable, or people might wonder if any of the Houses understand the importance of a law.", "Despite being continuously insulted by Baronet Althalus, Sheriff Joshua has continued to handle interactions with the Doloreaux noble in an honorable and polite fashion.", "Looks like Mistress Meepers is siding with Sheriff Joshua against the Baronet Althalus. I hear she politely parted company from a scene where the Baronet was being rude because she couldn't suffer sitting by while the Doloreaux Noble flung commands and insults at the Constabulary leader. What a true Rinaldi.", "Even if you're a Noble, you don't really have the right to insult other Nobles. Baronet Althalus has gone back on the warpath against the Constabulary, telling Sheriff Joshua to shut his mouth or take his leave if he doesn't have anything useful to contribute to conversations. Way to set an example for his house, eh? And think of that poor Katrina who has worked so hard trying to smooth things over from the last incident.", "Insulting the Sheriff in front of others? Too bad for Baronet Althalus people aren't comprehending his issues with the law anymore, nor are they appreciating his commanding a fellow Noble to leave the room or shut his mouth. He might think the world revolves around him, but if he continues being rude and nasty he's headed for a wake up call.", "The Sheriff politely dealt with Baronet Althalus despite the Doloreaux Noble being very rude to him, telling him to shut his mouth or take his leave. He even bowed and stuff after being so insulted! I would have given that boar the what for, I tell you, but I guess that's why I'm a humble gossiper.", "Sir Brooks sided with Sheriff Joshua, and left a meeting after Baronet Althalus once again insulted the Constabulary member. They say there is power in numbers; how many people are on the side of the Doloreaux?", "Mistress Meepers supported Sheriff Joshua by leaving a meeting after Baronet Althalus again insulted the Constabulary. It's nice to see the Rinaldi keeping its loyalty to local law enforcers.", "For shame! Telling the Shriff to shut his mouth or leave a meeting. That's exactly what Baronet Althalus did, to a Knight no less. How can Nobles expect commoners to respect them when they can't even respect each other?", "Despite Sir Erwin knowing that Sir Brooks is a Noble, and confirming his knowledge of it, he didn't rise to bow to the Avoirdupois Knight when he entered a meeting, and never addressed him properly during the course of said meeting either. It's rude for Nobles to not acknowledge one another, especially if one of them is showing due respect.", "Miss Prudence fought with a pregnant woman in the middle of the commons. Not only did she fight with someone in that condition, but she lost! How embarrassing for her..", "Miss Prudence was brawling with miss Madalina in the middle of the commons with a full group of people around no less! How unsafe, and isn't that Madalina pregnant? I wonder what the condition of her baby is with all this fighting going on.", "Miss Madalina was brawling with miss Prudence in the middle of the commons with a full group of people around no less! How unsafe, and isn't that Madalina pregnant? I wonder what the condition of her baby is with all this fighting going on.", "While her husband did cheat on her, and she is pregnant, miss Madalina took it to a whole new level making a public spectacle out of the occurrence. If my significant other cheated on me, I surely wouldn't want everyone and their uncle knowing. How embarrassing.", "Mister Virendra has once again cheated on his pregnant wife, and was even obvious enough to get caught and let news of it seep out to the public. Why did he ever get married at all if he can't respect his vows?", "Did you know mister Virendra is actually still available? That's what the scroll his mistress sent to his wife said. Yep, and that's why she gave him good lovings. You'd think people would notice that pregnant woman he's married to at some point, but maybe he's with so many different women nobody really knows who he's actually taken vows to.", "The Doloreaux aren't very happy about Sheriff Joshua doing his duty and handcuffing Baronet Althalus in public. I think they would have preferred more discretion, but the law treats criminals the same regardless of rank. I bet it would have been handled more politely if there wasn't so much friction going on between the Doloreaux and the Constabulary right now. Jeesh, I'm glad I'm not a part of either of those organizations.", "Lady Theressa was said to be in the commons speaking only in her native Eastern tongue and looking amused when the commoners had no idea what she was asking. Maybe she assumes the language is the default tongue of everyone? I don't know, but it's pretty disrespectful to the culture of others, and really strange that she seemed offended when nobody responded to her questions.", "Sir Erwin was kind enough to act as Lady Theressa's translator to ease conversation with the common folk of the city. Apparently she has forgotten to speak Calabrese during her time away.", "Things are all good between Doctor Hush and the Doloreaux now. I hear she's even aiding them in speaking their case amongst the guilds and assisting in convicting the street rat Rankin for his crimes.", "That Taraji sure is a respectable and loyal employee. She not only turned down the promise of more pay to work for miss Prudence as bouncer at the Maison, but went and told her employer of the offer so no rumors would start that weren't already explained. Smart idea, especially considering how nasty rumors surrounding the Maison can be.", "Miss Prudence is trying to snatch away employees of guilds now, falsely promising them more pay to be bouncers in the Maison.

After the insult, she even punched miss Lidia in the face! A brawling prostitute .. just what the city needs.", "I hear miss Lidia was in the commons the other day wearing practically nothing. Prudence plucked at Lidia's camisole and called her a vulgar name, at which point Lidia slapped Prudence in the face and mentioned something about her being 'diseased'. It's no wonder miss Prudence is constantly picking fights! These people rise to the occasion, I tell you.", "Despite mistress Meepers still having to fight against unfair biases due to her past, she is doing her beset to quell rumors by being honest and understanding, and has gone back to praying in the chapel for those who speak ill against her and her friends. That's proof that anyone and everyone can find strength in the Light. Good for her.", "That fox with the yellow rose in her hair? That's Tatiana. I hear she was looking distraught and Virendra asked if she was alright, you know, out of the goodness of his heart, and she just responded with drastic accusations .. none of which could be true, naturally. Sure is rude to judge someone you don't know, even if you know them by listening to the rumors.", "If you plan on going out shark hunting, make sure to drag Meepers with you. I hear she can prepare shark skin like it ain't nobody's business.", "Insulting a man and calling him criminal scum without knowing what he's done or if he has a history of being bad is just rude. That's what miss Tatiana did, and hey .. wait a tick. Ain't she new to town? You'd think she'd be wanting to make good impressions by showing that she has some manners.", "Who's a cute little wolf cub? Lennox is! That little'un is also so polite and respectful, saying please and thank you even when he doesn't need or have to. The Sheriff has schooled him right in manners.", "Lia sure does get involved in a lot of things that aren't her business, but have you seen her get involved in things that are her business? Not many people have. Cleaning the trash, for example, or other slave chores she's supposed to attend to. Maybe she's too good for the work befitting her station.", "Miss Iolanthe has started showing an interest in understanding local etiquette and courtesy expectations by attending some of the Docktown courtesy lectures. It's so great to see commoners working to better themselves!", "I hear miss Prudence called one of Clover's workers a whore. Doing that is like saying he hires whores! He may run gambling dens, he may do loans at usurious rates, but he definitely doesn't dabble in whores except as a rare customer. Them're the facts.", "Mister Rhys is currently supporting people who want to further their education by helping pay for schooling for those can't afford it, and by donating instruments for those inclined toward music. I'd be suspicious of someone so nice if it were me, but it ain't, so carry on.", "Bob told Sally who told Joe who told Esther who told someone else I can't remember the name of that Doctor Hush has been going into private rooms unchaperoned with mister Leif. Even if they are courting, playing in each other's bedrooms isn't courteous behavior.", "That Veritas is always holding chairs and doors for ladies, gentlewomen, and even female commoners. Some of these Knights around town need to take lessons from him, seriously.", "I hear that the slave Lia gives out free salves and herbal products to whores without asking for any kind of reimbursement. The employees of the Maison just think she's great for doing that. I'm not so sure how the gardeners feel though about losing out on coin.", "Miss Taraji has been vigilantly guarding the infirmary for Doctor Hush while a patient is in recovery. It's good to have someone capable loitering outside the door in case anyone tries to sneak in and assault anyone again.", "I heard Madalina went and hurt Minni in the infirmary while Minni was recovering from the beating Virendra had given to her earlier. Oh .. you don't know that story? Madalina is Virendra's pregnant wife, Minni slept with Virendra, Virendra sleeps with both of them, and both Virendra and his pregnant wife went to assault Minni since she is obviously the one causing issues. Yeah, I can't hardly keep up either.", "Sleeping around behind your wife's back might be somewhat acceptable to some people, but beating up on your mistress after your wife finds out you're cheating? If Virendra can't take the wrath of his wife, it might be a hint to stop sleeping around instead of encouragement to beat on defenseless women.", "Not only does miss Minni sleep around, but now she's sleeping around with married men like mister Virendra. What a homewrecker.", "Esquire Katrina may be decent at dealing with other Houses, but she can't seem to keep her own embassy members from acting inappropriately in public. As acting Ambassador and a supposed expert on courtesy and protocol, you'd expect her to have a stern talking to with mister Leif about his improper public displays of affection, but she hasn't. Perhaps being a stricter judge of character when it comes to who the people in her House can court would help? One thing's for sure, doing nothing in response to his activities is bringing shame to the Doloreaux.", "I heard from a sailor, who heard from a healer, who heard from someoneâ€™s wife that Hush lets Leif grab her inappropriately in public! When they were caught, they both denied anything was going on. I guess they were so wrapped up in each other, they forgot the crowd of people in the commons...", "Leif was all over Hush in the commons -again-. She should know better than to allow that, recently having been promoted to the rank of Yeoman. She doesn't even try to stop him in crowded areas, so it's no wonder he keeps doing it.", "I hear Leif is at it -again-, groping and kissing Doctor Hush in the commons. Honestly, is that what the Doloreaux consider appropriate courting procedure?", "Does anybody ever see Eldro doing anything work-wise? I don't, but someone happened to see him carrying 27 denarii around the other day. I thought slaves weren't supposed to have money as a general rule? Oh well, nobody seems to care what he does or doesn't do anyway.", "I hear Lia went and told the Sheriff about some creepy black magic business. What a brave thing to do, especially since the accused is known for being crazy!", "Disdainfully speaking about the Constabulary and how they like to 'waste their time handcuffing Nobles' is hardly a productive way for Baronet Althalus to mend his relationship with the city's law enforcers, or with the Rinaldi for that matter.", "Mistress Meepers recently injured her leg falling down the stairs in the boarding house, and Deputy Krell has been assisting her everywhere she needs to go. What a good Constable he is!", "A monkey heard from Naomi that Ryan told her she should work as a whore in the cat house. Even a serf should know better than to encourage his own daughter to be a whore!", "I hear Deputy Krell threatened to have miss Tatiana charged with insulting an officer for expressing her opinion on a bath satchel. What is the Constabulary coming to trying to make criminals out of people with fashion sense?", "Not only is he a capable Sheriff, Joshua is a sharp dresser, too, and he can perform well in his very best attire. You'd never know he only owns two pairs of boots unless I told you. Oh wait .. shoot.", "Mister Gothryd came out of the cathouse unabashedly talking to others about how relaxing the whores were. He even had the audacity to discuss the bull who had been in there before him. Even the Maison has etiquette, and disclosing who frequents it in a public forum just isn't appropriate conversation.", "I don't think mister Zander is a healer, but he took it upon himself to set Sang's nose when it got broken, even though it was spewing out blood everywhere. Talk about some atrocious volunteer work!", " Mister Jace has been giving free lessons to those who don't know how to swim. I bet the number of drownings start to decrease thanks to his generosity, or they increase, depending on how good of a teacher he is.", "Mister Rhys always honors the holy day of Dimache with several hours of prayer. Other people need to take a hint from his dedication and loyalty to religion.", "Serfdom has brought Ryan closer to religion. People are talking about how he has been spending Dimache praying in church. Thanking S'allumer for your blessings is a sure way to continue receiving them.", "Talk to S'allumer much? Ryan does, especially on Dimache. Just go to the church and you'll likely find him there honoring the Holy Day.", "Miss Taraji is following in her boss' footsteps, honoring Dimache with prayer and observation of the traditions of the Church.", "I heard Lia was giving Doctor Hush an attitude when the Doctor was trying to explain that giving away pastes and other supplies adversely affects other students, gardeners, and healers. There's a way to state your opinion without being offensive, but Lia obviously picks up her manners from her Doloreaux owners.", "How low the Doloreaux seem to have fallen lately. I was told that Esquire Katrina has been openly contributing funds to one of the many new streetwalkers in the city who is vying for renting space at the local brothel. How absolutely scandalous that a gentle woman would so freely support such an establishment.", "Doctor Hush has been writing on the public boards in favor of stepping up against black magic babies at the request of miss Cincin. It's nice to see the guilds stick together on some issues.", "I hear Mistress Meepers did a good job and helped miss Brie out with her auction due to Brie being injured. How nice that despite the two are both seamstresses they can still get along and not have everything turn into a competition.", "Miss Angeline was heard saying she wanted to see mister Sang naked after she'd only met him two minutes prior. How utterly improper, and doesn't she claim to not be a whore?", "Miss Schiacchitano is ever polite and proper when dealing with persons of rank. I hear she made a fine impression on mister Rhys, and even managed to impress Countess Aedina.", "Unsolicited, and out of sheer generosity, mister Rhys was said to have given two aureals to miss Tatiana to help her buy new clothing. He sure is sweet to the women, isn't he?", "Mister Virendra has been threatening people from behind bars! He told miss Tatiana she shouldn't chide or insult him for the crime he committed when he would be released shortly. I don't doubt him either, after what he did to miss Minni.", "Katrina is giving money to support the establishment of prostitutes in the city. That's terribly inappropriate for a woman of genteel nature, and especially one who prides herself on teaching etiquette and courtesy and supporting the ways of penitence.", "Know what you should do if a masked stranger asks to groom you? Smile and back away. Just ask Nayrienne.", "You know that Caliste? She made some food for a local event, but ended up making too much. But instead of throwing it out, she distributed it to a group of needy beggers. How thoughtful!", "That wolf seamstress, Dahlia, had a wedding not too long ago. I heard that she sent a bunch of refreshments out to her friends that weren't able to make her reception; even slices of the cake! Lucky!", "You remember that fire in the boarding house a while back? I heard from one of the Severed Tail maids that Caliste raced upstairs, heedless of the smoke and flames, to rouse people who would otherwise be burnt to a crisp! How brave!", "That Xena sure is becoming quite the diplomat! Not only did she arrange the parlay with the infamous Seaweed Joe, she also hired mercenaries to protect Lord Marcus, wrote up all the contracts, and handled all the negotiations.", "I heard Veritas accompanied the group who went to meet Seaweed Joe to protect Lord Marcus. He handled the company well and was very attentive.", "Despite being a commoner, Taraji can keep herself composed and proper among higher company. She is even good with creatures, like Seaweed Joe's parrot, whom she kept entertained during the meeting.", "You know that very quiet wolf, Grimclaw? He also attended the meeting with Captain Joe. He was very observant throughout, and lent his support to the Rinaldi, despite not being a member.", "Fyros attended the meeting with Captain Joe, despite not being offered any pay or compensation for his time, made the introductions, and stood to support the Rinaldi. Oh, and he helped keep the Captain's parrot occupied.", "Despite being in the presence of an infamous pirate, Lord Marcus handled himself responsibly and professionally at the meeting. He took care of most of the diplomat talking and assisted in arranging the parlay.", "Xena handled herself typically well during the parley, but most of all she made sure the deal struck was followed through, no matter how long it took. She has the patience of a saint.", "Xena is good about providing work for the small mercenary guards around town. She enlisted Veritas's guild, the Sentinels, to protect her and Lord Marcus during the meeting with Seaweed Joe.", "Veritas was accidentally overpaid by Lord Marcus for the work he and his guild did during the meeting with Seaweed Joe, but the guild leader promptly returned the extra amount. How honorable!", "He hosted a party for Beltane, explained what it was for, provided food and drinks, and included everyone in attendance. It was really fun.", "He provided music for Veritas's Beltane event, free of charge. It's hard to come by entertainers these days, so was good of him to come and liven up the festivities.", "He helped provide music for Veritas's Beltane event, without expecting any pay. With a shortage of good musicians in town, it was nice of him to offer his services.", "The festival of Beltane was a big success, and I heard Caliste helped prepare for it.", "The potted plants around the city sure are thriving. I saw Shade scurrying around town making sure they were pruned and watered.", "Xena chaperoned a meeting between Esquire Aysun and Lord Twyrch, and it's a good thing too, can you imagine the trouble that would stir up if anyone started any rumors between the two nobles?", "I heard Lord Twyrch crafted Esquire Aysun a literal smorgasbord of shiny new furniture for her hard work for the Embassy and for handling what no one else would. He also made sure she was being paid properly.", "She made a request of Xena to escort herself and Lord Twyrch up to the Esquire's room for a private meeting, so that no one would spread any nasty rumors. A very appropriate action.", "Esquire Katrina was kind enough to let her own courtesy lectures trail off while Xena held her own so there wouldn't be split groups. Apparently the whole thing was to see if Xena was deserving of sponsorship. How clever.", "You know that lioness, Xena? She does a real good job working for the Rinaldi. Capable of handling situations involving jewelry-crazed birds, hostile pirates and protecting her Nobles all at the same time. It's good to see a commoner represent the Rinaldi so well!", "Have you heard about Angeline? Apparently she went to the prominent seamstress, Brie, for a clothing order and introduced herself as a Mistress. When asked what kind of mistress she was, she refused to answer, then called Brie naive for practically no reason. How rude!", "You didn't hear this from me, but I think Caelith thinks his employer, Clover, is fat. He said something about Clover being exhausted, probably from climbing down his stairs. I don't want anything bad to happen to me, so I don't think Clover is fat..", "It's hard to believe that new arrivals in the city can be so respectful, engaging and polite, but that gorilla Gothryd is all three! He was also brave enough to accept monetary assistance to help him get started.", "You wouldn't believe what I saw! Cullan, who recently got married, was taking Inalla up to the guest rooms, and without an escort or anything! Scandalous!", "I saw Inalla go up into the guest rooms willingly with Cullan, a married man. And without an escort! Can you believe that? I wonder what Mistress Pru would think.", "That Prudence sure is a little tart! She was harassing Doctor Hush in the commons, right in front of everyone, calling her horrible names and accusing her of being a bad healer. And without any reason other than to be mean!", "That Prudence again.. she was even harassing Caliste just because she thought Caliste was wearing clothes too fancy for a slave. I think Prudence isn't wearing enough for being a commoner, in my opinion.", "Someone needs to whip that slave Eldro into shape. He doesn't do anything a slave is supposed to do, like cleaning the rash receptacles. I'll feel sorry for him when Faile finds out.", "I overheard that Prudence asking Veritas, in the middle of the commons no less, if he wanted to bed her! Ugh.. don't the local prostitutes have any sense of discretion?", "I don't know all the details, but I heard Madalina stormed over to the infirmary and attacked an injured woman, all because she can't control her husband. Who violates the safety of the infirmary like that?", "Caliste is so incredibly helpful to others, it makes my eyes hurt. She is always freely sharing her knowledge to anyone interested.", "Even though her own arm was mangled badly, Shade helped bandage Brie after being injured during the shark hunt. How caring!", "Did you know about Captain Fyros? He doesn't own his own ship, and instead rents them - but he does bring them back in one piece, which makes the ship owners happy.", "A fisherman and a captain, Fyros is also a waiter! At the auctions, he was fetching and carrying pie. Good to see a man who can make himself useful to his guild superior.", "The Dean of Arts? He crazy! But polite, stopping to help Brie when she was on crutches and had all that furniture to move.", "I hear Leif is saving his strength. While Brie was struggling on her crutches under all the furniture, Mr Leif pretended he didn't even see her and left her to sort things out on her own. But you just wait until Leif busts out his strength, he'll be so well rested that he'll punch right through a stone wall!", "Some tips for meeting new people. 1) Have a third person introduce you to them, if possible. Do the same for anyone you do that the stranger hasn't met. 2) Ask them thoughtful questions, like what they do for a living, or what noble house they support. 3) Avoid wrapping your tail around strangers. Even people who are courting shouldn't carry on like that in public. Asking them the thoughtful questions from step 2 while touching them just shows everyone else that you're fondling a stranger in public. Where are the constables, to file charges of disorderly conduct?", "That Brie, she's either really dedicated, or really greedy. Holding an auction, after nearly being eaten by a shark. Maybe Brie is dedicated, and the shark was greedy?", "That greedy shark, trying to eat Brie. Luckily, Meepers offered to help with the auction. Good on her.", "You don't want to be Brie's fiance. That shark attack, Mr Ramsford got hurt too. But then Brie sent him running all over town carrying packages for her auction. The poor man! Oh well, such is married life, and Mr Ramsford shows how a good husband should behave. Isn't that right, girls?", "Cursing and lecturing people about eating meat? Who does that serf think he is? And what does he expect, should wolves go on a salad diet? No no, I'm going to eat meat if I care to, and he's lucky I'm not an atavist, or I might consider some pot roasted rabbit.", "Kissy kissy kissy. I think Hush and Leif are joined at the mouth. I guess gossiping about them behind their backs wasn't enough for them to get the hint. Maybe we need to gossip louder. About HUSH and LEIF. Doing THAT THING TOGETHER... you know, KISSING. IN PUBLIC. AGAIN. Was that loud enough? Think they'll find a room next time?", "I heard Taraji was half-naked while swimming. Some people think that's bad, but I hear she isn't half bad looking. And I guess it's all fine. It's not like she was swimming naked, after all.", "I heard Opal was half-naked while swimming with Taraji. Phwoar, too bad I wasn't there. It's not like they were swimming naked, though.", "Unmarried? Flirting? Suggesting they would 'drag each other off'? Carrying her off in his arms? And on a Dimache!", "Unmarried? Flirting? Suggesting they would 'drag each other off'? Allowing herself to be carried off in his arms? And on a Dimache!", "What's this? Ximen was asked about courtship, and sent him to Xena? I know she handles courtesy lectures, but shouldn't a priest be able to give advice about the first steps leading to marriage? Isn't that one of the things priests do? Is Brother Ximen so full or fire and brimstone for the heretics that he's forgotten to guide the faithful?", "Taking an interest in politics, attending meetings, participating in contracts, and setting a good example? His superiors in the Sentinels are certainly noticing Jace's behavior!", "I've noticed Lysandus has been attending Sentinel meetings. Think he's bucking for a promotion?", "Have you heard of Lysandus? Better avoid him if you are a cat, unless you like being called kitty. But you haven't heard this from me.", "Docktown has a few rugged and crude people around. Some claim Lysandus is one of the more disrespectful types, but I never seen the man myself.", "When someone wanted to go and bath without a swimming suit, Opal ensured no such thing happens. She lent the suit for him so he can look for turtles. Smooth and proper, don't you think?", "You hear about that dog? Well, it seems his name is Lysandus and he clearly doesn't respect Nobility. He's been pretty rude in front of Dame Grazia. I wonder how the nobles and their guard will handle it.", "Cursing in the church? Loud enough for people outside to hear? Tsk, tsk. I wonder what brought Ryan to do so.", "You know what they say, if you can't handle people digging in your laundry, don't spread it in the commons, right? Maybe Madalina should stop cursing at people who explain to her why her daughter might be avoiding her.", "Zoe is a very popular and skilled carpenter. But maybe she still should answer all her scrolls and customers. Some seem to be quite upset about her lack of correspondence.", "So you have issues with manners and protocols? Veritas, I heard, is always ready to aid in the field, patiently and kindly explaining rules of courtesy.", "My my, some people just love to complain. If they don't have a satchel, that's the problem, if they have one, then that's the problem. Tatiana should have valued Deputy Krell running all around the town to get her a satchel when she complained about lacking one. Even if it didn't fit her attire. Careful what you wish for.", "Employees of Veritas claim he is one of the best employers people can have. Loyal to the people he employs, makes sure their needs are taken care of and paying fair wages. Not bad. Shouldn't all guild leaders be like this?", "Taraji's co-workers seem to be rather pleased about her helpful spirits and ability to mediate, when such need arises.", "S'allumer is the most important, right? Right! But some do not wish to learn of him! Lysandus picked whispering to a whore instead of learning of the light. Doesn't he know, S'allumer sees all?", "Bishop Basanti? She is quite actively seeking leadership when she is around. Did good with all the sermons, and the chapel was filled with followers. But I hear some feel low about her sudden leave. I hope she is all well? She didn't even have time to settle matters of the church, before she left, I heard.", "A devout follower of the light, Esquire DiDraco, or as others know her, Meepers. She is often seen in prayers on the hol.", "A devout follower of the light, Esquire DiDraco, or as others know her, Meepers. She is often seen in prayers on the holy day of Dimache.", "Not only is Ryan rumoured to have been in the possession of grain, but he has also been openly showing it to others, in a crowded bar, no less! Good think Jace and Anabella intervened.", "What a good chap that Jace is. I heard he, and some others aided to stop a slave from using grains and reported the event to the superiors so the constables can handle it.", "You know how mos people are really lazy about informing the constables of bad things? Well Taraji ain't one of those people. She has been diligent to report things to her superiors so they can inform the constables. That's important, especially if grain is involved.", "Giving out clothes to the needy, listening to their ails and giving good advice, that's what Taraji is to friends.", "A real gentleman, people say. No wonder some envy his mate, Taraji.", "Some people, not only does Inez openly admit to her questionable profession, but she also gives away names of her clients. I wonder how she expects to have any clients that can pay in the long run.", "That Hush is such a creative doctor. Using steaks to have her students practice the stitching on. Who would have thought. I hope they let a beggar eat the food after it, stitches or no stitches.", "Courting different people is one thing, but Althea openly talking about her previous mates is not something people should hear in public.", "Esquire DiDraco, also known as Meepers is valued by the church. She understands the process of power within the Church, she asks for a boon and then makes a donation to the Church within her means.", "Some watch with growing worry and envy, that Veritas Rhys' mercenary company spreads in various non martial fields. Traders, blacksmiths, all are drawn to the Sentinels. When he goes to the competition for teachers, will that backfire to anyone, I wonder.", "Ryan has truly embraced the spirit of S'Allumer, unconditionally forgiving people for their past sins and transgressions against him, he made an impressive display of what it means to be an Penitent.", "That brash horse, Clover? He is a real Docktown fellow, anyone can tell that by the crude remarks he makes while staring at women's derriere. Not something you'll see in Newtown.", "Shhh, shh, have you heard of Hush? Once upon a time she has been courting Master Ekalah, but as he left town, she had to move on. But I heard she has been causing issues about some jewelry he gifted to his new love? Women and jewels. Who can understand them.", "Jayland is so polite all the time! Always quick to help people when he can, like when when Virendra was injured, he instantly helped him to the infirmary. Courtesy not always expected in Docktown.", "Meepers was thoughtful enough to adopt a child of her own breed. She does deserve a bit of happiness.", "A package was delivered to Jace, full on money. He soon learned the money didn't belong to him, and he sent it onward to Clover. That was the proper thing to do, yet so few would have followed that behavior.", "A package was delivered to Taraji's mate, full on money. They realised the money didn't belong to him, and sent it onward to Clover. Mighty thoughtful and proper of them.", "Clover is said to be a caring guy, making people smile, when they feel all upset and down. Look how he cheered up Opal the other day.", "Hush certainly knows how to make deals. When asked she agreed to put a hold on her bidding on the auction item, she sought, so Veritas would not miss out on it. That's how you make gestures.", "What an honest girl, that Taraji is. She and Jace were having a package of coins she could put away without consequences, yet they returned it to Clover. I tell you, that's a big deal!", "What an honest man, that Jace is. He and Taraji were having a package of coins he could put away without consequences, yet they returned it to Clover. I tell you, that's a big deal!", "Even after Ryan was sold, Jahren, having the best interest of the town on mind, decided to keep training Ryan without charges, so all could benefit from their skills.", "Virendra, that wolf? You know him? What a rude guy. When Clover called him up to his room to have a private conversation where he could have got a well paid job from Dame Valara, he just kept growling to his wife in their wolf tongue, closing out both the host and the Dame from the conversation. He should know better then to insult those people. How does he expect to get paid jobs from them this way?", "You know Madalina? What a rude lass. When Clover called her up to his room to have a private conversation where she could have got a well paid job from Dame Valara, she just kept growling to her husband in their wolf tongue, closing out both the host and the Dame from the conversation. She should know better then to insult those people. How does she expect to get paid jobs from them this way?", "Wynter from the Rinaldi is a real caring and sweet woman. She takes all the unwanted clothing and changes them into fashionable, good quality items. She has golden hands when it comes to seamstressing.", "Many claim that Ryan, the slave is a slave by heart, but he can stand up for things he believes in, even if he has to oppose Clover for it. Brave move. I am curious what Sir Brooks is to say about that.", "Why does a landed person care for the eating habits of a slave? I heard Cullan went a long while to make sure Ryan stops eating vegetables.", "Sir Brumble is a prominent person, Zander noticed it and went out of his way to assist him in his daily deeds, bringing tea and helping with any matters tasked with. Impressive and smart.", "Sparring has different rules in Docktown and Newtown, but even so, Veritas should not have continued sparring Zander after seriously injuring him, nor acting callous while his sparring partner was being treated, you know.", "He might have caused dire damage to Zander while sparring and having a bit of fun about him, but he was good sports then, making sure Zander is taken care of and having hot chocolate while recovering.", "Ryan seems to act better since owned by Sir Brooks. The slave made sure that wounds of Lord Samstag is treated properly after the Lord's sparring match.", "That Guardsman Biggs really cares about the people of Triskellian! When that crazy panther Kafka attacked someone in the jail and held them hostage, Biggs was the only one who was worried about them getting hurt. All the other guards were too busy talking - one of them even told the hostage to shut up! We definitely need more guards like him, who take their jobs seriously and actually care about people.", "That Kafka is one crazy panther! He attacked someone who came by the jail and held them hostage in an attempt to get the Sheriff to let him go, can you believe it? He was already in jail, so he obviously doesn't know how to behave, but even that's taking it a bit too far.", "When found Lord Otto von Samstag in need of a healer, esquire DiDraco, also known as Meepers, hurried to his aid, the seamstressing practice must have come handy for patching up his shoulder.", "Zev stood by Lord Samstag and did his very best to protect the lord, when conflict with Jaren happened, even though he could have been gutted in the process. None can have anything against a bloke with a spine.", "Virendra was very willing to help out any stranger who is new to the city, showing them numerous places and introducing them to citizens. Making new people feel welcome is an example we should all follow.", "Hrm, Augustus? Keep the tone down. You know what I heard? He provided false testimony against a noble's personal rival to gain the noble's favor. Though who doesn't do that? No good pulling whiskers of nobles.", "Defending your house is important, but is that worth enough to lie to the constables in order to harm personal enemies of your house' nobles? Many would say yes. Especially if it comes to the Doloreaux.", "Meepers and Virendra needed some plants and didn't know what to do, but that slave? Ryan? He did his best to assist in obtaining said plant. Real helpful of him.", "It takes a lot of guts to stand up against a house, not to mention if it is the Doloreaux, you have to face. But Gnaeus did just that, to ensure the freedom of Docktown denizens. Rhea and Jarek surely appreciated his efforts.", "Some say, Hush is quick to throw her fellow commoners under the carriage if it looks like it'll get her in good with a noble. Or maybe she just happened to agree with the noble?", "An upstanding citizen, that Chesh. I was told, he defended an innocent man from false charges, despite his personal feelings.", "Kilana was willing to risk his goodstanding with the Doloreaux in order to defend the commoner's rights. Or was it more done for Rhea and Jarek? People say both things.", "Senora is loyal to her house, I heard she has testified in favor or her house in the case about Rhea and Jarek. The Doloreaux have always been a close knit house.", "Oh my, an Avoirdupois who publicly makes fun from nobles wearing tutus in private? Nan should know better to keep certain laundries behind closed doors.", "Sir Brooks has trained his former slave quite well.  The young serf has manners that reflect quite well upon his Master.  Nor could one fault him for his generous nature.", "Krell knew he can not beat Chinco, but he risked his life, as the Constabulary's interest and his own duty so demanded. People like him make the Constabulary an establishment that makes Triskellian proud.", "That Ammy lass? If you feel you need a lapwarmer, she might be the one to ask, I heard she is free to sit on men's lap in the commons. Though you might get slapped if you try. Lasses are fickle things.", "Risking his own life Chinco fought capably when the sylphs requested an excursion to the sewers to collect spider silk.", "Sable risked her own life in order to obtain the spider silk needed for the sylphs.

Some slim buxom birman who was only wearing a chainmail bra!  He was showing her the performers in the marketplace, but his eyes were certainly not on THOSE performers...", "From his reputation you might not know it, but some claim that Valentin Forza is one of the most professional business men in Triskellian. He understands the finer points of business, including working with others and has no hesitation paying very well for goods and services.", "Doctor Jahren is very generous with his services and knowledge, offering both free of charge and only asking for donations if his clients believe his work merits it. Though some claim this causes the economy to have some imbalance. Still quite charitable of him.", "Whenever you want to find Jahren, he'll be in the infirmary, tirelessly tending to the needy and sick, no matter how cranky they are or how tired he is.", "You may not hire anyone in your guild that is not fitting into that guild perfectly.

Hrm.", "Virendra ain't getting more friends by mimicking and taunting people, especially if they are from the Avoirdupois. Who is surprised Nan took offence?", "Did you hear about the Dean of the university? No, the woman, not the crazy one. I hear she's courting someone, but still went up to some other man's room to drink whiskey. For an awful long time. You would think someone of her station would know to take an escort. Wine and women, I wonder if there was any song?", "Hear that Clover's been inviting women up to his room, without escorts? That rascal! I bet this isn't going to help him rise in society, but from what I hear, his aspirations are much lower, so he can get away with this.", "I hear that Mr Clover is a really friendly guy. It's good advice to be friendly, when you're in his line of work, it makes certain he has lots of friends around. And he'll continue to be your best friend... until he's not. Then you'd better run away fast, because if he catches up with you, you won't be able to run on those legs anymore...", "Did you hear that Sir Bayard went slumming through the sewers to fight some spiders, or collect their silk. Don't the Avoirdupois have any guards that could have been sent instead?", "So Ryan called a guild council meeting on behalf of Faile, and represented her. But Clover wasn't happy about that. He was so unhappy that he... that... I just can't talk about it. OK, I'll try. He was so angry that he... he called Ryan names! And he's usually such a polite young man!", "Miss Zenkuro is the honest sort. Unfortunately, she is honest about her profession too. She was willing to say to anyone she is a pickpocket. Let's hope that's just a bad jest. Just make sure you tie your pouches around her.", "Not only a good, but a patient teacher, Doctor Jahren. He remains polite and encouraging during teaching how to handle a bow, never laughing about missed shots. Isn't that what we all wish for ourselves?", "What goes around, comes around. That's what they say. But why would Calista work for someone she badmouths behind his back? Doesn't make much sense for me.", "You know what they speak of Celia? She is a smart, proactive and capable business woman. She's very helpful if you need to get things for a reasonable price and in a timely manner. Good to know.", "Captain Carlon is an upstanding member of the Rinaldi. Yet, you know what they say about him? He has offered to train a member of the Avoirdupois, and free of charge even. Now if all could follow that example...", "Such a selfless fellow, Doctor Jahren. If you want to be a healer, make sure to read his book. He worked a lot to provide free knowledge for those who want to better themselves.", "What? What's wrong with people?! Didn't you know grain is illegal? Why eat it in the commons so blatantly? Maybe ask Shaira, why she did it.", "Nicki, a real friendly cat. I heard she is the one to seek if you care for free catnip. That must be why so many felines are around her.", "Running around drinking all the time is not what you want your kid to be remember you buy. But it seems that is the life Madalina is planning for her baby.", "I was trying to get some coin over at the dock, and you know what I saw? Edwardo trying to sell a bonefish for 10 denari. And when he couldn't fool the others he was telling them, they are bad merchants? Arrogance can go a long way. But not always.", "My sister was in the Commons the other day. She came home all unsettled and told me he overheard Flynn offering a woman to try him out, and the women then gladly headed off with him toward his room.  But you know little sisters, they talk a lot.", "My sister was in the Commons the other day. She came home all unsettled and told me she overheard a man offering Calista to try him out, and she then gladly headed off with him toward his room.  I hope it's just a little sister talking too much.", "Dahlia is known for her generosity, giving free clothing from poor people that recently arrived to town and having the dust of the road still on their clothing.", "Paladins are allowed to have wives, yet they are still an example we are to follow. But is Damon to show a proper example, I ask? Coming to town claiming to be a paladin only to run off with the first woman that shows interest in him to a private room. Tisk tisk. Wait till the church hears of this.", "We all know, how Virendra is, cheating on his wife right after she left, but honestly, in the jail? Did he think the guards are blind? That place is full of constables! Some people just feel no shame!", "Zenkuro, young and beautiful? Sure. But certainly not decent. Getting intimate with a man in the jail? In front of all the constables? The jail is Constable HQ for S'allumer's sake! You can't burp one without having an elbow in your mouth.", "She made a heap of jewelry to practise or somethin' an' then just gave it all away. How generous. She even made sure it got distributed evenly between the people present.", "A friend of mine saw Dame Katrina and Esquire Lianaar chat with each other in the most amiable way. Yet I am told that whenever those to get together and giggle, it means that they are scheming against some poor sap. ", "We thought by now Virendra learned not to pick fights in a bar, too many witnesses. But if you do, at least have the guts to admit it.", "Promising to treat a patient, people wonder why Jahren wanders off to chat with Hush instead. Who wouldn't want to know what Doctors speak of between themselves.", "It seems every time I'm hearing about someone go off talking to Zeiss, they come back a bit queasy at best. You'd think after all these years, and criminal charges, folk would learn not to be in the same room alone with him. Though only really bothers me of course when its a friend looking all perturbed.", "Randomly insulting people that aren't even around to defend themselves is a bad way to go about getting friends. Specially dangerous people.", "You know Esquire Xena? A good person to do business with. She will not accept downpayments, only after she provided the service. Lucky for the Rinaldi to have her.", "Not even greeting people before engaging them in conversation and being rude with them is not something that'll aid Zeiss in getting rid of his excommunication, is it?", "That Virendra's getting smarter! In order to accelerate the resolution of his black magic problems with the Church, he offered to aid them by lending out some of his warrioristic guild members.", "It's not only the Church spreading the word of S'allumer! Esquire Lianaar herself is committed to preserving the integrity of her faith, and hasn't had any problem speaking the word and acting to protect it. I spy a secret paladin.", "Dame or not, Katrina is ever generous in sacrificing her personal time and income to matters of import. Most recently she was caught donating to aid in the finding of a cure for the sick.", "What's up with the clergy these days? After learning black magic was performed in front of the chapel, miss Tomoe dismissed it saying she couldn't react or respond without Presbyter Ximen around. It's no wonder curses and a lack of faith in the Church are spreading.", "Miss Nan is really good about making introductions between people who are unfamiliar with one another. We need more proper, polite, and well-mannered individuals like her in the city.", "Need a good notetaker? Just ask Ryan. I hear he took exquisite minutes of the guild council meeting for people who weren't in attendance.", "While most artists will agree that the physical form is beautiful and something to be admired, mister Sang has taken it to a whole new level by verbally promoting nudity in the commons. Some opinions should simply be kept private, or at least are better expressed in a private setting.", "Nobody seems to know whether Chesh is married to Kilana or not, but plenty of people know he has a fondness for kissing her in public. Methinks someone needs to learn the rules of courtship and the boundaries for affection in public settings.", "Nobody seems to know whether Chesh is married to Kilana or not, but plenty of people know they have a fondness for kissing in public. Methinks someone needs to learn the rules of courtship and the boundaries for affection in public settings. And shame on her for purring!", "People are complaining that Ryan gets into their business too much, and that he's just going to get himself in trouble because of it. Maybe waiting to be invited into business first would be the best solution?", "I hear it took Sang four months to finish one item! It's too bad the bloke who told me didn't let me know whether it was worth the wait or not...", "Doctor Hush is a good friend to have. I hear she took it upon herself to gift Clover a wooden basin when she found out he was looking for one from Sang.", "If you want a good contract written up, Vajhira's the girl to contact. I hear she's even working on her temper, so she might be more pleasant to work with.", "Loyalty is a virtue that's worth recognizing, and Santiago has it in spades; just ask around.", "I heard Luciano went crazy in the commons and ended up stabbing Ammy. Chinco Jr. sure is growing up to be something ... special.", "How many times can someone threaten that they're leaving the city without ever actually doing it? Just ask Madalina - she's on her way out again supposedly. Hurry along then, and if you make it anywhere, don't forget to write!", "Take a tip boys: Giving lands as a pre-wedding gift to your bride-to-be shows trust, generosity, and an understanding of the impact of economy on a marriage. If you want to know how to make a woman happy, just go and ask Clover for advice.", "Doctor Hush is a good healer and kind enough to share her healing supplies with Doctor Jahren, though she might not want to drag the doctor from treating a patient while doing such.", "If you don't like the clown's joke boo, maybe toss a rotten tomato at him, but don't follow Virendra's lead. No slapping the clowns, please!", "Virendra is a nice guy. Or is he not? Well it seems he did quite a lot of things to impress his wife. Be it name calling, rock throwing and mocking. I wonder if it was worth the effort.", "It is not the best thing for a woman to be seen entering men's chambers all on her own. Someone ought tell Bekka that.", "I saw Inquisitor Tomoe some time ago in public. Sitting on the lap of a guy clothed but in loincloth. What secrets was she prying from him?", "If you want to buthead with the church, be careful. I heard Mufasa did it right in the lounge. Bad idea, I tell ya!", "I heard Nan saw Virendra take a wolf skull, draw magical symbols on the ground, make the skull glow...and she never reported this heresy and black magic to either the church or the Constabulary! That leaves everyone in danger by staying silent and practically condoning the behaviour.", "When Doctor Jahren had issues with Flynn, he didn't just drop contract, but kept his side of the bargain and sought resolution calmly like a gentleman. And thus, the resolution was found.", "When the Avoirdupois needed aid in a dangerous assignment, for the good of all, miss Maena offered her services for way less then the danger would demand it.", "Shhh, you know what I heard? I heard Virendra permormed black magic rituals, right in the commons. Was he not scared priests come from the chapel? But then, I ain't seen the priests putting him on a stake yet, so who knows.", "Helen is said to be a very competent business woman when it comes to interguild relations and negotiations. She almost single handedly managed to preserve a lucrative business arrangement for her guild with her light touch and skilled diplomacy. That's word on the streets.", "Inquisitor Tomoe has been seen around the Maison in company. Well, woman of ill repute need to take confessions too, but why not in the chapel?", "Triskellian is the very heart of the S'allumnitan religion. A bad place for Sinjaa to speak of how the Lord of light is just made up and how its followers are all weaklings.", "Helen is a faithful follower of S'allumer honoring the sanctuary of Dimache.", "When Taraji was seeking someone to sponsor her for promotion, she didn't just ask for it, but she sought to become educated about the rank, what would be expected of her, how it would effect herself, the company and her role in the company she was working it.. She made sure she knew exactly what she was getting and what was expected of her. That's the responsible thing to do.", "You know Polgara's brother, that big tiger Mufasa? Well, I saw him dragging poor Inquisitor Tomoe around the Commons by the arm, berating her for... *ahem* Private issues. There's something to be said about a man who airs his dirty laundry so freely. Especially if clergy is involved.", "Shaking people in the commons stating they like someone more then them is odd, even for someone like Mufasa.", "Not only did Virendra engage in fights in the commons, but he didn't have the decency to remain quiet about it. Still, writing it all up on the lounge's boards?", "Miss Helen is quite a civic person, even if people like Virendra are set to annoy her, she keeps her cool and expresses her displeasure without being insulting or emotional. If only more people knew how to do that...", "Deputy Krell is a known figure of the Constabulary. I heard he is man enough to apologise for his short comings and alter his behaviour if needed. Virendra might learn something from him.", "Some gentry have taken notice to Clover's eccentric methods of dressing and taken right to complaining... for good reason. Apparently this sizable man has an affinity for wearing female undergarments and finds no shame in sporting them, and himself, publicly. Being unique is one thing, and being inappropriate another; perhaps someone should offer to make him a robe for such adventurous occasions?", "I hear that big tiger, Khagra, he was seen often in Church when he was leading the Rhashak Clan. He sure has come a long way. Making up for past mistakes and shortcomings by trying to spread the teachings of the Light all the way back to his home lands and attending Church whenever he can. The church is always a good solution!", "Tiberius made a good start in his employ with the Constabulary. Soon after being shown how, he already got down to papers and did all the administration on his own. Initiative people are always welcome in places like that.", "Come on, Chinco, do you never learn? Attacking a constable now? You should find something other then that to entertain yourself with.", "Being bored is a state for Chinco, I heard. One that makes him grab a weapon and whack people with it. Bad bad habit. Someone should tell him to learn sewing instead. Just not me.. you there, you tell him?", "What to do if your friend gets attacked? Stand by and watch idly, I heard that's what Sinjaa did. I don't want to know how Tiberius repaid his loyalty.", "That Virendra, he might be just not as bad as people say. He is kind enough to make healer's life easier by distracting their patients from pain so they can work on them swiftly and professionally. That-a-boy.", "Chinco is determined to pull the whiskers of nobles by his continual disrespect. Guess what? He manages. I heard more and more nobles are getting quite annoyed by that man.", "People getting into conflict with Ryan always get irked.  I wonder if it is the boy or that he chooses badly in whom to get in conflict with.", "I heard, Ryan was chiding someone above his rank about their own child. Rude and also not really any of the slave's business, what you say?", "That artist, Sang? I heard he was sick as a dog and collapsed right in the commons! Hurt his head something fierce. But not to worry, his friend, what's her name? Vajhira Rhashak, that's right! Well, she took good care of him and made sure he got to a healer just in time.", "Not only is Tiberius diligent in his tasks as a constable, but he is also motivates others by his good example. I heard even Joshua caught up on his old missives seeing the deputy work.", "Ryan is certainly loyal to the Avoirdupois. I heard he has been filling in Brenner on news and the house on all things of interest.", "The Avoirdupois were always chivalrous people. People say Dame Valara is one of the best examples of them, one that understands why some topics are just not meant for anyone's ears. If only more followed her example.", "Tiberius is quite collegial, inviting others in the constabulary for drinks. But smart enough to buy non alcoholic drinks since duty can await at any corner.", "If you need a seamstress working on short notice and even take the initiative to decide on some matters about clothing, then Nan is the perfect person for you. I heard she is good with working under pressure.", "Questioning your superiors is slippery ground. You can not ignore flaws, but you can not openly question them either, unless you are a Bisclavret, I was told. And even there it has dire consequences. Still, questioning your house leader openly in the commons with the half town witnessing it is just making the challenger, the leader and the house look bad as a whole. Why did Brenner go on with it anyway?", "Sir Bayard knows how etiquette works. He asked his house's leader for permit on courting before he progressed with it. Romantic endeavours have their own protocol after all.", "Dame Valara knows how etiquette works. She asked his house's leader for permit on courting before she progressed with it.

Why would a man brag about being able to best every person in battle when only non-martial women are around? I have a few ideas...", "Public name calling might be natural for Madalina, but it is still not customary for general populations, not if they want to be more then fishers in the town.", "Whoa, that tiger lass, Nisha? She ain't afraid of showing her feelings. She was seen yelling and screaming in the commons to a masked panther. I heard she even clawed the bark of the big oak tree. Poor tree, it was entirely innocent, I swear.", "I heard Nisha does lose composure at times. What's this about yelling names at people, calling them whores? I wonder if they were actually.. right. Nice day we have, no?", "Nan is a duteous member of the Avoirdupois. But then, why is she pulling a sword in front of a noble when the noble made it painfully clear she doesn't approve of female swordfighters.", "Being arrogant is a bad thing, however calling yourself a minion is a bit uncouth. I heard Nan did it anyway.", "One should always ask a noble for permit before approaching, Krell should have done that in regards of lady Aria.", "Thukal knew how to handle matters of protocol by introducing people unfamiliar to each other.", "What a kind soul miss Bekka, I heard she was willing to walk all over town to aid a stranger with finding a place. Being helpful leads a long way.", "Fips is a great gardner, and an honest and honorable man. Whie accidentally handed over his platinum Rinaldi coin of favor with a handful of coins to pay for a purchase, and Fips caught it and returned it instead of keeping it. Good, honest man.", "Have you heard? A ghost ship was sighted? What all happened, I don't know, but I was told Kilana ended up in the water?

Lord Samstag bravely stood in the first line to welcome the shark with loads of bullets right in its face.", "During a trip where a shark attacked the ship, Sable was quite dedicated to defend her co-passangers.", "During a trip where a shark attacked the ship, Hush was quite dedicated to defend her co-passengers.", "During a trip where a shark attacked the ship, Clover was quite dedicated to defend her co-passengers.", "During a trip where a shark attacked the ship, Ammy was quite dedicated to defend her co-passengers.", "Risking their own lives, Sir Erwin and Lord Otto von Samstag fought against the infamous pirate captains, and due to their mutual effort, Lord Samstag managed to kill Captain Kuvik, feared pirate of the seas.", "Risking his own life, Caelith fought against the infamous pirate captain Redbeard, contributing to the fall of the most feared pirate of the seas.", "Risking his own life, Clover LePlow fought against the infamous pirate captain Redbeard, not only contributing to the fall of the most feared pirate of the seas, but gutting the captain with his own hands. .", "Ever heard of Redbeard? That was one mean bastard of a pirate. The guilds in the town got together to kick his sorry ass. People from the houses were also there, I heard there was a big fight. Santiago even got to save Lianaar, that Rinaldi esquire.", "Disliking a house is one thing, but calling the Bisclavret traitor phelans is an entirely different bowl of soup. Odd coming from Caelith, who was once in the house.", "Virendra Ashendale is an odd sort of fellow. I heard he wanted to cut off Redbeard's head after the guilds won the battle against the pirates. UGH.", "Sir Erwin went along an expedition to clean the waters of the pirate Redbeard and his lots. The good Sir acted knightly all the way along, not forgetting his manners even on sea and took a big part in taking down the pirate captains.", "The guilds of Triskellian arranged for a fleet to wipe the haughty smear from the face of Redbeard, infamous pirate captain of the seas. Dame Valara was smart enough to both ask for her house's permit and represent her house on this mission. Nice to see a soldier house do some soldiering.", "That Luciano is certainly being foolish every step. First just randomly stabbing people, but then pretending he didn't have coin to pay a debt before trying to hire guards. Why did he think people will not catch up on that? Then he refused to pay a small debt in blood, however he fought to the death. That doesn't see smart to me. Might be prideful, but not smart at all.", "Cullan's politeness is certainly appreciated. Escorting back Dame Katrina to her room without being reminded, that men should do so was noted.", "You know Madalina? Mad Dog Maddy, her other name. Wanna know how she earned her name? I ain't sure I do, but I heard she be right mighty jealous of a type, yelling names at any woman her husband been layin eyes on.", "Do you know how Doctor Hush keeps doing these little tea parties? If you are invited, it is polite to go. But once you go, don't be like Vajhira. Don't keep standing near the door, inching outward and thus make it all awkward for everyone else, right?", "Doctor Jahren is a healer dedicated to the well being of the citizens, even if they harm themselves or refuse to listen to his advice.

That's very nice of her.", "Smith Nisha is not a stupid woman, selling weapons cheap for the constabulary is a good way to build contacts.", "Chinco isn't really expected to be promoted, is he.

That's what you expect from house members.", "There is this huge bear from the Roth? Gegnar, he calls himself. He might look all intimidating and is quite quiet, but is always proper and nice if he speaks. That's why he is a valued guard of the Doloreaux.", "Esquire Meepers is a compassionate and genuine person, however she dislikes losing argument. On rare occasions she even unleashes her wrath on people who have nothing to do with the thing she is angry over. Composure is a virtue.", "Grimclaw, some claim, is quite argumentative, isn't he? I heard he got in conflict with Dame Katrina and kept pushing the matter even with Master Ekalah trying to sooth matters.", "Adonis is a large lion, appearing all savage, however he knows manners.

But he should still acknowledge his rank as a Rinaldi Lord.", "Madalina decided to give birth to her child while not being married, even though she had the chance to officially have a husband at that time.

Declining when invited by a knight is disappointing.", "Calling out the Rinaldi Reeve in the commons because she declined a lesson in matriloquentia is hardly professional nor Knightly.

The point is, you shouldn't curse at law enforcement.", "Miss Nan was speaking improperly to a superior about their tone of voice when she was, in fact, mistaken in thinking it was an act of unkindness.

At a recent reception, they say all she did was whine and complain. Talk about an event spoiler.", "After a first and second request from a Noble to remove her mask, Maggie was said to still refuse.

It's a good thing she did too, because nobody else from her embassy showed up.", "Hush was very polite and praised Madalina and Virendra for their work on the pirate raid voyage, even though their personal relationships weren't golden at the time.", "Good for Noe. At least one of the Avoirdupois aristocrats could get off their backsides to show up and thank the people who did the job of their embassy for them. Even if fighting pirates is too hard for the likes of Nobility, at least one might have been able to walk a few blocks and say some nice words.", "Miss Noe represented the Avoirdupois house at the reception held for those who fought against Redbeard. It was nice that she could take on the sudden job of delivering medals and handing out recognitions.", "More people sing the praises of Clover for his holding a reception to honor those who aided in fighting Redbeard.

You would think getting shot at with an arrow while your baby is in your arms would teach you to be more careful, but apparently not.", "People generally think Dahlia should have been more proactive in arranging an expedition to find her husband's remains. She was okay with pronouncing him dead and letting his body rot wherever until someone else put up the money for a group to go search for him. Even then, she didn't ensure that a competent leader was in charge, or that the group was prepared for what they might encounter.", "Dahlia went along on the expedition to find her husband's body, despite being an obvious liability due to her having no combat-related knowledge. Some people think it would have been better if she didn't attend, regardless of her personal relationship to the victim, while others think it was very appropriate for her to be present. I can see how it would work in both cases.", "It was kind hearted of Virendra to volunteer to lead an expedition to find Dune though he should have realized his lack of leadership skills and appointed someone else to lead. During the expedition, he was indecisive and only acted when pressured to by others. Then when the fighting was done, he spent more time joking around than tending to Suavis who was near death and eventually died.", "Suavis did some amazing work on the expedition to find mister Dune's remains. He even sacrificed his own life to keep everyine in fighting shape so they could ward off the bandits they stumbled upon.", "Despite the tedious nature of administrative work, Tomoe is more than willing to do what has to be done so that the church functions as it should -- even if it cuts into her free time.", "Suavis' heroic combat medic activities were indescribable! When the Dune expeidition party discovered a bandit army and engaged in combat with them, he was there, at every scratch and gash to fix up the fighters.  If you are gonna be in a battle, take Suavis with you!", "Mister Sang is apparently not only the best artist around these parts, but he's also the best teacher of music, and he charges a cheap, fair price for sharing his talents with anyone willing to learn without bias. This is a good way to encourage the growth and learning of people in the city with the expert toutelage of a Master passing down his knowledge.", "Mister Sang made the verbal assumption that one is a 'muscle-headed brute' if they hold a weapon in a dangerous part of town. In this case, the observation wasn't taken appreciatively. Perhaps more constructive criticism in the future is the way to go, hm?", "Miss Helen's recent generosity to a newcomer didn't go unnoticed. Apparently giving aureals to the passerby lands you big rewards in the gossip column, but also lighter purses.", "Miss Helen has been very supportive and patient with her betrothed's daughter and dealings involving her. She has put up with so much more than most anyone in the city would when it comes to Vajhira's attitude.", "When speaking on the topic of marriage in the commons, miss Helen verbally contemplated the impact an eloping would have on the house Rinaldi.

Miss Helen is being recognized for taking a stand against Chinco for the Rinaldi, even though she isn't a member of the House at all.

I hear he'll go out of his way to help place you in another career better suited to your tastes.", "I heard that in an effort to curb the poor behavior of Vajhira, Lady Aria lo Bianco appealed to Khagra to allow for an arranged marriage.

Yay for smart people!", "Jaws dropped as Deputy Tremain insisted on publicly searching miss Zeera in the commons simply because he believed she was lying to him due to her past crimes. Think it would have been more appropriate for him to have taken her to the jailhouse, or somewhere a bit more private? I'm thinking so.", "Seems a newcomer to town stepped up and offered to perform an impartial search on miss Zeera for the local Deputy Tremain. Even though it didn't happen, people were impressed someone was willing to step up in an effort to uphold the law, maintain dignity, and promote peaceful resolution.", "That Fyros volunteered to go on an expedition to find mister Dune's body, and was said to protect miss Xena throughout the entire encounter from bandits. Rinaldi or not, that's bravery, and an exemplary example of a good guard.", "They say mister Virendra volunteered to act as leader of the expedition to find mister Dune's body, but that he actually had little to no leadership skills. People came back gossiping that during the encounter, he didn't have any plans on how to actually fight the bandits, and even allowed a healer to be killed! Whew, I wouldn't want that on my conscience.", "People are raving about what an amazing medic mister Suavis is. During the bandit encounter, it's said that he managed to keep the majority of people who went bandaged and capable of fighting, even though he was the only one with healing skills available. And at the end of the whole ordeal, he gave his life! What a great sacrifice, and what an example to set for other healers in the city.", "Always saying one thing and doing another? That's what they say about mister Khagra. Supposedly he vowed to shun his daughter from hsi family after some ridiculous behavior toward his House, but then recanted and decided to try to give her yet another chance to redeem herself.

It seems recently he has been on high guard looking for Ery, who attacked poor miss Rosemarie. It sure woul be nice to have more guards like him looming about.", "It seems miss Hush has been bringing up personal topics in front of the gentry, and even when she is told to stop due to stepping over social boundary lines of rank, she continues to persist. There's a lesson to be learned here! Don't share your personal life with people who outrank you unless they explicity ask.", "Jahren is praised yet again for his ability to be kind even in stressful situations. It's said that after miss Rosemarie's attack, he remained steady and gentle with her, as all good healers should. Ahhh, it's good to know there are medics who can be trusted to be consistent.", "Miss Tomoe was being raved about the other day for bandaging people for free even though she had obligations elsewhere. Healing before business, I say! Unless healing is your business, and then it goes hand-in-hand, doesn't it?", "People seem to be pleased with Guardsman Biggs who was dutiful in performing a retrieval of a body from the bay, putting himself in harm's way for the honor and dignity of a murder victim. Honorable members of the Constabulary are always a welcome and relieving sight to the city!", "Despite being injured, mister Kaine assisted a Guardsman in retrieving miss Hush's body from the bay. Way to go out of the line of duty to do something good!", "The Guardsman is the talk of the town still for doing his best in trying to find Hush's killer against very difficult odds. They say he's been giving it his all, even going so far as to jump into the bay of Auvrich to fish for her body. Talk about dedication!", "People's tongues are wagging talking about miss Demeter who was apparently very rude recently, interrupting conversations even though she was pointedly asked to wait before speaking. It's always better to be polite and patient than to have some beggar on the side of the road tattling on you for your transgressions.", "Gemma's giving advice for life again! She was overhead saying that if you have nothing nice to say, then not to say nothing at all. This was in response to someone being less than kind to her, so I say way for her to be the bigger person!", "There's a new storyteller in town, politely asking public loiterers if they want to hear his words before regailing them with tales. It's a nice change from the violent tendencies of Docktown, and people are noticing!", "Miss Helen has been working on murder investigations and cooperating with the Constables. They're all very impressed with her inclination to go beyond the call of a citizen of the city, and why shouldn't they be?", "The commons was gossiping about Aluine and Bekka openly arguing about Aluine 'sleeping around'. People should know by listening to me regularly that you need to take those kind of discussions to private places rather than having such conversations in public.", "People are all aflutter over the Dean of the University killing Madalina on the docks. Even if she came back from the dead not fully healed in the head, you can't get away with murder and not suffer the consequences.", "While I think it's pretty funny, other people aren't too happy about Santiago punching Leoric in the face right in the middle of the commons. If you want to greet a drinking buddy, that ain't the way to do it.", "Mister Silvanus was seen waving his gun around in the commons and trying to drag off miss Rhea despite being told only Constables have the authority to arrest people. You'd think a gentryman would know better than to behave like a wild man, but apparently he doesn't. Maybe a change of scenery is in order?", "Oy! Silvanus pulled his weapon on Rhea in the commons claiming she was a wanted criminal, but took the act further in becoming a vigilante and dragging her tail to the jailhouse. He didn't even lower his pistol when two members of his own House, and a member of the Bisclavret guard stood between him and Rhea, and continued to refuse to listen to reason. Talk about inappropriate behavior from a member of the gentry! I bet his House is just mortified.", "Wtinesses are verbally commending miss Helen for putting her life at risk by stepping between Gentleman Silvanus' gun and miss Rhea. It's a bit on the crazy side if you ask me, but you aren't asking me, so who cares? Anyway, others seem to think it impressive she can keep her cool even when people are acting irrationally.", "Put in favor for the wrong person.", "Despite being a convicted criminal, miss Rhea wasn't lashing out when Silvanus was yelling in her face and provoking her to do more. She turned to upstanding citizens to confirm what she had to say through words of logic rather than use of a rapier. Is reformation possible? We'd like to think so!", "Everyone is stepping in front of Silvanus' guns these days! Add mister Carlon to the list, who positioned himself before miss Rhea when the Esquire was acting out of control. He reasoned with his housemate to the best of his ability and eventually brought about a suitable outcome despite insult to himself and his House.", "So Silvanus is now a constable.  No really.  He tried to arrest Rhea in the commons.  For serious.  Oh wait, he's not a deputy? Then why was he waving his pistol and making a big show of arresting her, even though he can't!  He even threatened to shoot Carlon and Helen if they wouldn't get out of the way, despite their attempts to talk him out of getting himself arrested.  What is this world coming to?", "During the whole debacle with Silvanus and Rhea, it is said that miss Helen stalwartly stood at her housemate Carlon's side putting herself in harm's way in an attempt to dissuade Silvanus from shooting Rhea and getting himself arrested.  Now that takes some courage!", "More and more people come to tell me the tale of Silvanus, and they remain aghast to hear that one of the Rinaldi's own gentry would pull a gun, act vigilante, and even try to shoot through his own House members if he had to to arrest someone he didn't have any right to arrest.", "Old news, but still news regardless. Gentleman Silvanus .. yes, you guessed it .. tried to arrest Rhea despite not having the authority to do so, even going so far as to draw his gun on her. I'd act more surprised, but I've been telling these stories all day long.", "Even though Silvanus is said to have apologized for wrongfully trying to arrest miss Rhea, he reportedly continued to call the Constabulary incompetent afterward. I'm guessing they weren't inclined to believe his apology was sincere. I'm guessing I probably wouldn't have believed him either.", "Gentleman Silvanus is on a rant about Rhea being a pirate, but hasn't managed to gain a scrap of evidence. Even after Lord Marcus asked him to stop doing it, he continued to argue the point that he was right, disrespecting his own Noble and disobeying a superior's order. I see bad things coming in Silvanus' future from this whole fiasco ..", "Mister Zev is somebody's hero! I hear he came to Deputy Oushi's side while trying to apprehend miss Rhea and mister Jarek, and even got wounded while doing so. You know what they say - women like scars.", "Docktowners are complaining that miss Sapphire engaged in a public brawl in the center of the commons with mister Chinco and miss Vajhira. Apparently fighting in the slummier part of town is unexpected. Who knew?", "*tisk tisk* Seems Hadrien was caught engaging in a public brawl in the center of the commons with mister Chinco and miss Vajhira. Just how many people were invited to this party anyway?!", "Good to have that Biggs fellow around. He single-handedly took control and diffused a brawl in the commons, bringing all the wounded to the infirmary for treatment before investigating the crimes. Now -that's- how a competent lawman handles things.", "Some people whisper that the rumors about mister Hadrien aren't true. People witnessed him being removed from the brawl in the commons by Guardsman Biggs because he was bleeding, kneeling, weaponless, and not fighting upon his arrival. Poor guy ..", "Hadrian is actually a hero! He came to miss Sapphire's defense in a time of great need when she was outright assaulted by Chinco. Unfortunately, miss Vajhira set upon him, and he took a good licking for it.", "Seems Chinco is still .. Chinco. He aided Vajhira in an assault against Hadrian and miss Sapphire out of sheer boredom. That guy really needs to get a new hobby.", "Miss Opal took to diligently seeing to the wounds of those involved in a brawl in the commons. Sometimes I wonder if they'd keep brawling if there weren't good healers handy to always save them.", "I hear mister Sang was trying to persuade miss Vajhira and mister Chinco to spar somewhere besides the commons, and even urged onlookers to find a Constable for the brawl that took place. It might have been nicer had he gone and looked for a Constable himself, but, hey, small things count.", "Want free hat-making lessons? Go find Carolyn! I hear she'll help people out of the kindness of her heart.", "I hear miss Helen pays her bills quickly and in full. If you want a good customer, maybe you should look her up? Debt free is the way to be!", "Miss Xena is a tactical genius, or so I'm told. Between her and Mister Fyros, they rallied the troops and took down the bandit leader.", "Stealing corpses can be good - Xena retrieved the body of her fellow Rinaldi after the bandit incident. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about... don't you?", "Scandalous! I hear that miss Sunta snatched a folder out of someone's pouch and then went through their correspondence and teased them in the middle of the commons. That's definitely not appropriate behavior for a Rinaldi squire!", "They say even if you prattle off rude remarks to Doctor Hush, she's very understanding, a good listener, and always willing to accept an apology. How very gracious of her! It's nice to know that not everyone will punch you square in the face for being obnoxious.", "People have taken flirting back out of the bedroom and into the streets. I hear that miss Madalina was allowing mister Donovan to snuffle her hair and fondle her tail in the middle of the commons. I realize it's Docktown, but some things just are best kept private.", "People have taken flirting back out of the bedroom and into the streets. I hear that mister Donovan was snuffling miss Madalina's hair and fondling her tail in the middle of the commons. It's said he even proceeded to whine as she made it a point to tease him with her body. Really, take it to a private place!", "The Bisclavret are angrily ranting about mister Cullan being a traitorous ingrate, going behind the back of his house to seek employment with Lady Grazia without even asking the permission first. All those years of protection, land, money, and martial training, and that's the sort of treatment he gives to his embassy?! I bet he risks a lot more than just a dishonorable discharge, turning his back like that on the Bisclavret. Lesson: Don't take oaths and then act against them, or, if you're going to, at least don't get caught!", "Zev is good to have around, always retrieving corpses of someone or another and reporting crimes to the Constabulary. This time it seems it was one of his fellow housemates who needed toting to the Cathedral, and he promptly had a case opened to try to find out who had harmed them.", "Rumors speculate that mister Greeves gave a woman a cursed armband to make her fall in love with him and do inappropriate things against her will. Hard to say whether or not it's actually true, but an interesting story anyway.", "Reportedly, the Avoirdupois are quite disappointed in miss Nan, who made it a point to say she wished to return and be part of House activities, but then never showed up to a House meeting after expressing she would be there. Reliability is important as a servant! Better to say you aren't sure that you can make it than say that you can and never show.", "I hear miss Opal went to miss Hush for some training on how to handle plants, and instead of Hush encouraging Opal to try harder at gardening, she told her instead that she had no talent and should take up medic training. That's not a very good method of teaching if you ask me.", "I heard that miss Una has sloughed off on her studies, including religion, and that even though her ignorance of church practices might be considered unforgivable by some since she's the daughter of a Knight, mister Bernard offered anyway to help further her education, and even appeared to be understanding that her own father, Sir Brumble, hadn't seen to it already.", "Even though miss Nan has been otherwise occupied, it seems she has taken time while in the company of others to give several lessons to other seamstresses, going so far as to share tips and helpful advice. Crafters supporting crafters, as it should be.", "Detestable! Squire Cullan of the Bisclavret was heard leading a conversation on cannibalism in public. What an offensive subject, and to go as far as discussing the actual consumption of people and the possibility of using their skins for leather? Better keep an eye on this one ..", "Surprisingly, mister Bernard was heard having a conversation with Squire Cullan in public about eating people. Conversations about cannibalism are quite offensive to most people, and likely best kept private.", "Once again, Chinco was caught drawing his sword in the commons for no reason whatsoever, this time against Zev. Doesn't it ever get boring?!?!", "Miss Lidia is said to be handling Paladin Damon's too-public interest veryw ell, maintaining a polite distance. Compared to previous actions, that's certainly a step in the right direction, and one for which she should be commended.", "Mister Kaine is always ready to defend the defenseless, of ten preferring to use words instead of sword when conflicts arise, which isn't the norm for Docktowners. Gotta give credit where credit is due!", "Mister Chinco drew his weapon in the commons yet again, attempting to attack a rather crass mouthed zebra who was being particularly abrasive.  While I can understand him being upset, there is no reason to endanger others by causing violence in the commons.", "Citizens are appalled at the utter disregard that miss Tomoe has shown her betters. She apparently took charge of the church and suddenly felt that she could speak poorly of Nobility in public. She even went so far as to threaten to use her 'Church powers' to have rank taken away from a member of the Bisclavret. Is this really the sort of person we want representing our city's religion? I think not.", "I don't care what you say about mister Virendra, if you leave your bagpipes laying around, he's sure to return them undamaged. That's more than can be said for some people.", "Deputy Oushi deserves some recognition for all the good work she has been doing for the Constabulary in the absence of her superiors. They say shes really stuck with it through all the negativity, and that's certainly commendable.", "Seems like Lord Samstag needs to go back to etiquette school. I heard he stayed seated when Lord Marcus stood to leave after one of their discussions, rather than rising and bowing as is proper of Nobility. And you all think meetings between Nobles are casual. Hah!", "Chinco has reportedly been carrying weapons despite being banned from doing so, and was even caught causing a ruckus in the commons with miss Ashai. Surprising? No, not really. No, not at all. Still, ignoring bans isn't something to be ignored.", "People are singing the praises of miss Shade saying what a wonderful gardener she is. The story goes that the daisy patch outside the blacksmith building was dying, and after it was brought in to be kept warm, miss Shade started taking care of it for the city. It now is thriving as if it were never on the brink of death. Glory for her green thumb!", "Inalla's housemates are all extremely proud of her for trying to do everything she can to reorganize the embassy in absence of any true leaders. She struggles with limited authoirty and does what she can to keep everyone strong. What more could be wanted in the servant of a great House?", "Handmaiden Inalla has been doing an exemplary job trying to assist the Ambassador in running the House while he is busy with other duties. Such dedication speaks very well of her character and commitment, and is something to be commended.", "Mister Luciano was heard cursing in the commons for no reason whatsoever, and then proceeded to tell people to .. well, you get the picture .. whenever they asked him to mind his language. If a beggar can't repeat it, then you know it must be bad!", "People are gossiping that miss Carolyn has been low on coin due to debt, and even though she and miss Helen have been at odds, Helen came to her rescue with a much-needed loan. Despite not having talked in weeks due to a personal disagreement, she helped, which was notably generous of her.", "Handmaiden Inalla made dozens of outfits and other clothes, scarves and such, and donated them all to the church to give to the poor to help them stay warm this winter.  Although she donated them on behalf of the entire house, it is well known she is the seamstress of the Doloreaux, so people would like to praise her for her good and generous works publicly.", "It seems miss Nan can be included in the group of those donating to the church and sharing her good fortune with those whom need it most. Praise for the generous, nothing for the stingy.", "Chinco once again resisted arrest, leading to a large fight in the commons between himself, several Constabulary members, and a small handful of fighters. You know what I think? Someone needs to take away all the apples and the peaches in the city and then -maybe- you might get through to him.", "Apparently Madalina has been siding with Chinco, most recently when he was fighting the Constabulary. She even went so far as to offer to draw her weapon against them. That's all we need is for him to gather a following of like-minded people!", "While people may not agree with the crimes mister Virendra has committed, they recognize that he has accepted the charges of heresy against him and is stepping up to receive his punishments honorably. Good people sometimes do bad things, and when they accept the consequences of their actions, they show that they're capable of getting better. Here's to hoping that he actually corrects his ill behavior and chooses a better path.", "Mister Fips is nice enough to give lessons in gardening to those who want to know how to pick flowers without hurting any of the plants. Need a bloom to give to a lovely lady? Go poke him .. I bet he'll help you find some good ones.", "They say Luciano was yelling, screaming, and threatening Doctor Hush in an attempt to get whatever it was that he wanted from her, and even worse, that he did it in the presence of Lady Georgianna of House Bisclavret. At least he could have reserved the poor behavior until Nobility was away from the area.", "If you're a healer and need another healer to consult, then I strongly suggest you seek out Doctor Hush! She's always very helpful and willing to suggest thing to try and aid in someone's recovery, even occasionally going so far as to give out droughts. Professional support is always a key to success.", "Need discounted flowers? Become a recurring customer of Mister Fips' and you'll likely get them! Either that, or let him suspect you don't have much coin so he feels bad enough to lower his costs. Hey .. it works for other people.", "Reportedly miss Lianaar was asked to testify against mister Chinco, having been a witness to his crimes. It seems silly that a Baron would have to ask her three times before she would do it, but maybe she has been preoccupied with more important matters. Regardless, her inattention to following orders has caused a few tongues to wag.", "Mister Sattar seems to want to try and pretend that he was never demoted. He was heard insisting people call him 'Gentleman' when anyone who pays attention to rumors or the public boards knows that he was stripped of his gentry status. Talk about rude and improper!", "Seems Sir Erwin sent a scroll to Sir Brumble explaining he'd been out of town during the Knight gathering that was arranged, thus why he was absent. Reportedly, he's the first member of the chivalry to even do that much!", "Doctor Hush is never to be busy to see any patient, any time. She'll stop everything she's doing to see you, whether you're a commoner or a Noble, even if your injury is only trivial. What a fine example of selfless service to the community!", "When entering a discussion about a Noble who flaunted an affair with a commoner, Lord Adrien is reported to have made snide remarks to someone of far greater rank, even taking the side of the disgraced nobleman. Where does the man learn his manners? Harrowgate must be far wilder than anyone imagined.", "Whether Lady Anne knows you or not, she's willing to pray for you in times of need. Just ask Meepers, who had the Lady praying for her daughter, Aine, when she was sick. Aiding people through selfless acts is a marked trait of Nobility, so it's no wonder S'allumer blessed Anne with the rank she has today if these words are a true reflection of her character.", "Out of all the people who signed up to participate in miss Nan's play, mister Bernard was the only original actor to show up. That's a true display of reliability right there.", "Supposedly miss Noire attended a wedding clad in armor. People have been complaining about what a racket she made as she strolled in very late to the event. I guess if you're going to show up tardy, it's best to at least be in the proper attire.", "I hear that Esquire Meepers took it upon herself to dance through the first dance at the reception of the newlywed Rose couple. Doesn't she know that you always always wait for an invitation from the couple before stealing their spotlight?", "Lady Georgianna has been consistently having socials. People rave about what a great success they they have been and how much fun they've provided for everyone in the city. Way to get people involved and interacting!", "It's said Georgianna is a kind and gentle Lady, and a stellar example of how Nobility should carry themselves. She tries to educate the commoners in what the Nobility is doing for them, and works hard to organize much-needed regular gatherings to promote open conversation and peaceful relations between those of good standing and the ranked in the city.", "Baron Edmond is said to have spent his entire coin pouch and then some at Lady Aria's auction for the needy, without a thought or care save for his proclaimto do all he could for charity. Truly there's a Noble heart inside this Noble Baron.", "Mister Sattar was seen butting into a conversation between a Noble Lord and Lady in the cafe at a casual social gathering recently, without first politely requesting and awaiting the attention of the one he sought to speak with. That's rather obtrusive behavior for someone of no rank, and people took notice.", "Lord Adrien has been helping the Bisclavret reform and grow stronger by acting as an advisor and friend to the current Ambassador of the House, Dame Anne. How very gracious of him, considering that he only recently arrived to the city.", "I hear mister Kaine offered to watch Meepers' kitten for a few hours. What self-respecting man would volunteer to watch a child that isn't his own? Doesn't he have the man parts to say that's a job for women?", "A Noble invests in the Sailors Guild - that, at least, would be somewhat reasonable, but to actually take over the guild directly? The guild of sometimes honest (usually not) sailors, smugglers, dockside petty criminals -- the home of the basest born? It's disgraceful for a Noble to publicly and officially run such a guild, as it's such roles that differentiate common born and Noble born.", "Scandalous! A member of the clergy is said to have caught mister Virendra urinating on a potted plant inside of the church itself! You don't need to be a genius to figure out the offense in that.", "Miss Nan was recently seen cleaning up the seamstress shop's large collection of clothing for the poor. Rumor has it that it was a terrible mess, and that she's been sorting it into outfits and bags for the needier to more easily rummage through. How thoughtful and selfless of her.", "Oh no! It seems miss Fergie has stopped writing back to her customers, even after they have sent multiple inquiries about orders, and regardless of their rank. They seem to be genuinely upset about their poor treatment.", "Miss Madalina was seen sneaking up to her room with a man she'd just met after she gave him a hefty sum of money. Have to wonder what she's up to now, don't you?", "T'he Doloreaux seem to be pleased with mister Cullan, who, despite not being a part of their house, took it upon himself to escort Dame Katrina safely to her destination.", "People are saying that mister Virendra tried to kill mister Auron after he was finished mutilating the corpse of miss Servita. Truly, this man's evil knows no bounds!", "When it was suggested by Baron Edmond that Master Ekalah perhaps join the Avoirdupois, he showed great loyalty and dedication to the Bisclavret, politely declining, but thanking for the offer. Wouldn't it be nice if all house servants acted similarly?", "Whlie Bekka is much-loved, people are starting to complain about her constantly sleeping in the commons. Not only is it inappropriate, but it's distracting to those out and about attempting to do business.", "Sang was asked to sing a song in the tavern, and automatically took to blurting out something involving bastards and incest. The people in attendance, though usually unoffended by even sailor ditties, took offense to his random selection and continue to talk about how inapprorpiate the wording was.", "I didn't know miss Bekka could heal, but apparently she can! She was quite helpful in recently assisting mister Kaine with some of his injuriese. So, if you can't find a proper medic or Doctor, you know who to turn to.", "Mister Kafka was overheard offering to teach someone else pickpocket in the commons. Doesn't he know that criminal professions are meant to be practiced and learned in secret? Jeesh.", "Lots of complaints against mister Auron recently, I almost don't know where to begin! For starters, they say that he begged miss Bekka for tons of teacher resources, and then after receiving some training, he guild quit without any forewarning, conversation, or plan and renegged on his contract. Aside from that, he was said to be presumptuous and rude to Lady Aria and reportedly almost blinded mister Joey in a practice duel. On multiple occasions when given the opprotunity to learn safety procedures, he showed callousness for the well-being of others, declining or disregarding the need for safety altogether. And now they say he's in the Rinaldi .. my, but I wonder if they know what they have on their hands.", "Did you hear that Xena was attacked?  Yeah!  Fyros went out and found the attacker, dispatching her in the process!  Ensuring the safety of other Rinaldi and protecting the general population is commendable!", "Did you hear? It sounds like Brenner and Xena patched up their differences after she was attacked! Brenner conducted himself honorably, helping to hunt down her assailant, taking care of the attacker's mangled corpse, and even standing guard outside the infirmary. Man. That's a good guy.", "When Xena was attacked in the commons, Noire was the first to react to her call for help!  If my wife is to be believed, the paladin dragged Xena from the commons and sought out a constable.  How utterly deserving of our praise!", "When Xena was the victim of assault, Aria visited her bedside to guarantee she was safe and well-protected.  When the Lady was told she shouldn't be in the area where the actual bloodshed occurred, she replied, 'A member of my House has been attacked .. where else in the world should I be?\\"  She's truly a loving and caring woman, a stellar example of nobility.", "Doing your job is something you're paid to do.  But Auron goes the extra league with his wit, charm, and general affability.  Especially when it comes to Xena and making her feel comfortable after she has been stabbed a few times.  Good chap that.", "People are starting to clamor about Presbyter Ximen not following the example of St. Helloise at all and only winning converts to the Light by instilling fear. Perhaps practicing some love, sacrifice, and charity would benefit him.", "Miss Lia stepped up and put another person before herself, making sure to heal Virendra and ensure his wounds were properly tended after his branding. Another example of a good healer doing a good job.", "Master Ekalah has taken to teaching a few individuals the basics of smithing, and I hear he even lets them help in the crafting of blades for his orders. How nice of him to share his knowledge with those less educated in metalworking, and to give hands-on experience also!", "Miss Bekka seems to be doing quite well with her guild and employees. Despite people thinking she wouldn't be able to successfully run an organization, she's pulled it off, and really helped out individuals who are new to town or uncertain about where exactly they belong.", "Say whatever you want about Rhea, but she helped to arrest Chinco, and that's enough to put her in a lot of peoples good books.", "Despite how he usually is, mister Kafka stepped up to the plate and assisted in arresting Chinco. The Constables seem pretty pleased with him, at least for the time being.", "I hear miss Lia did a fantastic job of patching up Reeve Xena after she was attacked by an assassin. They say the slave saw to the wounds with incredible professional and speed. If only all the healers were so polished.", "Captain Brenner guarded the infirmary to make sure Reeve Xena was safe and protected after the assassin attack on her. What a swell guy he is, looking over someone who isn't in his House and who he doesn't even seem to like.", "I hear mister Virendra helped capture Luciano after he beat up Deputy Zaria! Who says heretics can't still be heroes?", "Apparently miss Bekka pounced on Luciano's shoulders from somewhere high up and unseen, stabbing him in an effort to aid the Constabulary with his arrest. Criminals beware, there's some ferocity in that little package of a woman.", "Did you hear? Silkar performed an impressive shoulder slam against Luciano when he beat up Deputy Zaria and threatened to hold her hostage. He must have been low on catnip or something, to care about anything besides his next fix.", "Resisting arrest for a pickpocketing charge? One has to wonder how it was even worth it..", "Despite being far less skilled than Luciano, Deputy Zaria fought valiantly to bring him in when he resisted arrest. Them Constabulary members aren't the sorts to back down from a bully!", "Apparently mister Luciano has taken to stealing again, this time from miss Bekka. Don't you know that if you're gonna rummage in someones pockets, you have to be good enough to not get caught?", "Once again, Hush has spent her own money to restock stolen items from the infirmary, including pastes, salves, splints, canes, and crutches. How many other Doctors or healers in the city could or would do the same?", "Mister Virendra seems to have gained some ire for referring to the Rinaldi position of Maggiordomo as a 'slutty handmaiden'. Worse, he made it a point to share this disrespect of mister Edwardo and the Rinaldi with Lord Twyrch of the Bisclavret. A heretic judging other people, what's next?", "Apparently Physician Suavis thinks he's now an advisor to Nobility, and was recently heard criticizing Lord Twyrch for his choice in allies. Judging someone far above your own station never leads to anything good.", "I hear a man named Snortimeir barged into the cafe, squealed a rude greeting at a noble, and then proceeded to EAT a tuatara off of the floor. How disgusting and disrespectful can a person get, honestly?", "Mister Kafka was recently heard proclaiming that he could best everyone in the commons with both his hands missing, while wearing soiled pants. Likely it wouldn't have been a comment worthy only of an eye roll if Sir Bayard and Lord Adrien both hadn't been in the room. Such sorts of statements are inappropriate in the presence of Nobility.", "It might be a Doctor's job to help, but Jahren goes the extra mile. When someone was wounded to the point of being blind recently, he helped walk her upstairs, leaving the middle of a conversation to do so and abandoning the wait for his fiance. That he took the time to ensure his patients safety shows just how caring an individual he is.", "Mister Kafka has really stepped over the line lately, accusing the Avoirdupois of heresy, Lord Edmond of forging documents, and the Lords of the Bisclavret of corwardice. How does an embassy manage or choose to suffer someone with such a loose tongue?", "While mister Kafka might have a loose tongue, he was good enough to approach Captain Prideaux with Sir Twyrch, and apologize to him for the accusations against him and House Avoirdupois. Always remember it's never too late to say you're sorry!", "Despite a man being rude to Lia in the infirmary, she informed him that she took an oath to heal everyone, and went about doing her job. It's gotta be hard helping people who don't want or appreciate your aid, but it's pretty admirable to have a healer who will persist and ensure they're treated anyway.", "Mister Kafka is rumored to have been throwing around accusations that the Avoirdupois murdered a gazelle. I bet he's in some deep water with his house nobility and commanding officers for speaking out against another embassy in that fashion.", "People are raving about Lady Georgianna's sweet shop socials, saying they're full of fun for everyone. If you like tea, pie, and wheee, you should definitely look into attending.", "Rumor has it that Snortimeir literally tried to eat people. Nom nom nom? Who says cannibalism has gone out of style?", "What a courageous girl miss Rosaline is! She managed to evade being eaten by the most gigantic boar ever seen, and yet, instead of fleeing, she remained in harm's way to help tend the wounded people that defended her. Now there's a way to show your appreciation!", "People ramble that Snortimeir is a maniac with a bottomless pit of a stomach. I hear he even went so far as to try to eat other people, and in the commons in front of S'allumer and everyone no less! Call the Constables, and let's get this one under lock and key!", "Miss Lia was helpful in alerting the Bisclavret about a member of their House that had been causing some pretty serious problems; thus, helping to maintain the house's good standing in the city. I bet Sir Althalus would be proud of her thoughtfulness.", "Unbelievable! Mister Kafka asked if he could smoke in the presence of a Lady. How respectful not to assault a noble nose without first asking. There might be some hope for him yet!", "Mister Kafka seems to be more mindful as of late, even thinking to apologize when he forgot to bow to Sir Althalus. Perhaps the Bisclavret are taming him after all.", "Not only did Lord Samstag sponsor Clover LePlow for promotion, but he was prudent in making sure the lands weren't too close to the Avoirdupois border. Giving lands near his family estates was especially meaningful and will undoubtedly lead to reinforced ties. Safe to say everyone involved was well pleased with the arrangement, and his house should be proud of him.", "People gossip that mister Clover's swims and friendly attitude do well to maintain high spirits in the city. I wonder just what those swims involve that make them so enjoyable..", "Lord Adrien corrected his guardsman, Kafka, who was being lecherous towards Dame Aeryn in the commons. Yay for Nobles who know how to keep their servants in line.", "Lady Aria gave some sound advice to Maggiordomo Edwardo on how to approach a courtship with Sir Brumble's daugther, Una. She was patient and calm in pointing out his mistakes and further informed him what he needed to do to recover from his blunders. It's just like a Noble to show good leadership while discussing delicate matters.", "I hear miss Carolyn has been asking some of the local smiths for steel to gift to that heretic, Virendra. What gall she has thinking anyone would want to help him acquire anything!", "Word's getting out that Master Ekalah overcharges for the smithing items he makes. Apparently the majority of crafters agree, and all charge less for the same items than he does. It just ain't right for him to be taking advantage of people like that.", "Lia has been busy tending to her house duties, and writing scrolls to her owner, Sir Althalus, for the importation of plants. It's a good thing people can go to someone to get in touch with the Doloreaux nobility, or likely there wouldn't be any communication with them at all.", "Captain Kaine took it upon himself to help move furniture and refused to accept payment for the good deed. The Bisclavret sure do house some chivalrous individuals.", "When Luciano tried resisting arrest, mister Fyros had the mind to block off the alley so he couldn't escape. Good thinking, and way to help the Constabulary.", "A docktowner, and a boss in particular, shouldn't be out helping the Constables, especially fighting the employee of another boss. Talk about a big no-no! I hope nothing worse comes of it than these rumors.", "Mister Ilo has been very polite and helpful to newcomers, and even Lord Blackburne. I hear miss Bekka had a specific job she needed doing very badly, and he managed to hire someone into the guild capable of doing it. From watching boxes to recruiting, Ilo is on the rise!", "After Doctor Hush's call for a thief to return stolen items from the infirmary, Sir Twyrch dipped into his own pocket and time to produce a new set of cabinets for the city's use, and even arranged for a tinkerer to bring in locks to secure everything. How generous is the Nobility of Triskellian!", "Rumor has it that Fyros saved Ilo from an attacker, and has been helpful in teaching him new skills. Aww, to be the hero of a weasel.", "I hear miss Aradhyl is a natural healer. She helped others in the infirmary to heal Ilo, stepping right in and asking how she could assist without being squeamish or afraid to learn at all.", "The Nobles have been gossiping about how kind and generous Clover is, even giving a sample from an impromptu picnic to Lady Georgianna after hearing her social had gone largely unattended. Ain't it something when people look outside themselves to make some someone else's day better?", "A formerly filthy sailor, causing fights, mayhem, and havoc turning over his soul to S'allumer and his teachings? Truly an impressive change in one's lifestyle. It just goes to show that anyone can be touched by the Light if they open themselves up to it!", "Mister Kafka is still at his old ways, making scenes in public and bad-mouthing everyone with his crude talk. He really needs to shape up and get with it if he plans on keeping his job in the Bisclavret.", "Trying to eat innocent people? That's a monstrous thing, no matter who you are, or how big a stomach you have to fill! Triskellian isn't a barbaric land! People work to earn a living here to feed themselves. Really, mister Snortimeir needs to accustom himself to where he is, or go back to wherever he came from.", "Not only did Damara disrupt a conversation between another woman and a Constable, she did it only to be rude. At least if you're gonna impose, do it with a purpose!", "*tisk tisk* I hear Fyros got Deputy Zaria high on catnip and impaired her ability whilst on duty. How utterly irresponsible of him.", "Guess what? I heard Deputy Zaria was high on catnip whilst on duty in the commons. It's no wonder the Constables can't arrest people successfully half the time, what with them lounging around impaired.", "Miss Dazrene was said to have generously offered to give a girl new to town some of her clothing, despite the woman protesting that a seamstress could make her something suitable. How very charitable, though one has to wonder how well the clothes actually fit.", "Apparently mister Fyros showed open disdain for a language being spoken after it was made clear that the people involved were unable to converse otherwise. Triskellian is a melting pot of cultures, so it's no wonder that his intolerance is being met with displeasure.", "Master Ekalah generously offered to compensate miss Dazrene for a gown she gifted to a young woman who couldn't speak Calabrese. He also sought to aid the young miss in better understanding everyone around her. I bet the city would be a much more peaceful place if people behaved in a similar manner as he.", "Guess who was stumbling around dead drunk in the commons, approaching people he didn't know without permission, and announcing his affiliation with the Bisclavret? That's sad it only took you one guess. Yep, mister Kafka. It surely doesn't look well upon the House for one of their guardsmen to behave so poorly.", "I hear mister Cullan is still inviting women up to his room unchaperoned, even though he's supposedly married. Talk about shameful!", "Nobles of other Houses are commending Lady Aria for her good judgment of character in hiring miss Aradhyl. They say the Lady's companioni s respectful of Nobles, courteous and helpful, and thus does her Lady a great credit.", "Despite old age and weakening muscles, mister Dylan offered to help Leorory clear the rubble in the commons caused by the recent whirlwinds that attacked.", "More people are commending the aged mister Dylan for helping to repair the ground in the commons that was broken up by the whirlwinds. Apparently being old and still active is a great feat.", "While people were clearing the rubble in the commons from the whirlwinds, miss Aradhyl played them music, brought drinks to whet their lips, and made an attempt to clear up debris despite wearing fancy garments. What a multi-tasker that miss is!", "Deputy Zaria helped to repair the broken ground caused by the whirlwinds. Her vitality and eager willingness to aid with repairs were greatly appreciated and useful.", "Miss Aradhyl might night have been able to lift the rocks to repair the streets from the cyclone damage, but she did what she could, bringing drinks and playing music for the workers to keep their spirits up.", "People continue to commend Deputy Zaria for aiding Leorory in fixing the ground in the commons damaged by the cyclones. She is said to have worked very hard, steadily lifting heavy rock and debris.", "Did you know that Kafka doesn't like to bathe?  He stinks quite literally.  You would think a member of the Bisclavret would be held to higher expectations.  Not to mention pride in his appearance!", "Virendra is a heretic who can still do good things!  He went after Luciano after for beating up Zaria, even breaking the criminal's nose and getting him to jail!  Wonder what the church thinks about that.", "When offered trade goods worth quite a bit, Adrien refused the gift and insisted that the seller receive goods and services of equal value!  That's surprisingly honorable of him!", "That Kafka isn't afraid to tell you what other gentlemen are up to.  'Goin' ter wank one' is probably not something that needs to be announced.  Especially when hand gestures are involved.", "Donating to the poor and the church is good!  Dylan does that.  Especially if those fabrics aren't worth selling.  Now I know why the poor stay poor.", "I heard that Lennox knows how to woo a girl.  Sending flowers.  Giving escort.  That boy is a real gentleman already!", "Even after he was told that he couldn't help the Rinaldi help bandits, Virendra offered to send mercenaries and guards to help!  That's pretty swell of him wanting to contribute for no personal gain!", "Xena is such a brave and proper citizen!  She led an expedition to fight off evil bandits!", "Ilo is a dirty weasel!  Apparently he went into the sewers and then came to the commons and washed himself at the fountain in the commons!  Other people use that for other purposes, thank you!", "Xena is incredibly brave to be undertaking an expedition and risking herself to rescue a missing man.  Here courage in inspiring!  So are her hips.", "Despite being disrespectful to his social superiors and the law, Kafka can be a man and admit he's made mistakes!  Asking for forgiveness is a good thing.", "Brie takes time out of her busy schedule of... whatever it is she does around town to make sure he customers are extra satisfied!  If only I received that kind of service at the Maison!", "Aradhyl can be a little trickster.  She tried to trick Xena into going to a social with Fyros at the request of her Lady, then acting like a child when Xena disagreed!  Just who does she think she is?", "Healer and .. seamstress? Apparently so! Miss Lia was recently said to have helped in outfitting one of the Bisclavret guard out of the kindness of her heart. Truly, such a talented slave should be appreciated.", "Lady lo Bianco is said to have gifted out one of the most splendid gowns recently to Lady Georgianna in an effort to thank her for her efforts in throwing the Sweet Shop socials. Her kindness hasn't gone unnoticed, nor her own effort to promote Rinaldi fashion.", "Lady Georgianna has been most proactive lately in attempting to hold socials and events to engender interest in the embassies within the City. She's a great example of how Nobles should engage with others inclusively.", "Lord Adrien was most generous in donating troops to the Rinaldi bandit expedition. He set a very good example of how a guest should behave by committing his own men to retrieve an individual not even of his own Household. The respect he has shown to the Rinaldi is something to be acknowledged, and his generosity commended.", "The Baron most thoughtfully gifted a rapier to Lady Aria before the bandit expedition to ensure she had some method of protection should she need it. Not only did he have one custom made, but he had enough forethought to do it in Rinaldi colors. What a generous and fashionable man!", "Paladin Noire and Guardmsna Kafka were said to having an argument in the commons, when mister Claton took it upon himself to get involved and punch the Guardsman! While it might not be right to shout at a representative of the Church in that manner, it's also not right to get violent in public or stick your nose into business that doesn't conern you.", "Miss Lia took it upon herself to console Master Zeiss over the death of his wife, Temperance. That she would be so caring and considerate, slave or not, is commendable.", "The commoners are clamoring over miss Aradhyl, who seems to think that the working class aren't worth being polite to despite them having an obvious place in the city and society. It's important to remember that just because you work for a Lady doesn't mean that she can protect you from everything, least of all gossip.", "Do you know that miss Nan? I hear she has become a paragon of middle class values, and that her clothing craftsmanship is always excellent. She has recently been displaying a much better understanding of propriety, and has been helpful in organizing things for and with the Rinaldi's Lady Aria.", "Talk about surprising! I heard miss Aradhyl was chatting with others recently about being in a harem, and was overheard by people who thought it less than honorable considering her position.", "Miss Aradhyl was said to have accused Fyros of stealing her money pouch as he sat next to her in the middle of the commons. She didn't even stop to think that nobody else had witnessed the removal of the object, nor did she ask. Wrongful accusations can make for sticky situations, indeed.", "Did you hear? Captain Carlon was said to have had a spat with Reeve Xena in the commons over house things, and they were speaking as if they had just broken up. If that wasn't embarrassing enough, for some reason loin rubbing was mentioned. Just what exactly is going on in the Rinaldi these days?", "Captain Carlon was overheard making a lewd joke in the middle of the commons. In response to one man telling another man 'he's fast', the Captain replied that 'That's what the Ladies of the Maison tell me'. Funny or not, it's definitely not something to say in front of another House's noble.", "With very little regard for the reputations of people involved, Fyros persists upon insisting that he knows the truth about Captain Carlon and miss Dazrene's rumored relationship, despite the fact that he has been told otherwise.", "I heard miss Dazrene falsley accused Fyros of lying and spreading rumors about an imagined relationship between the Captain Carlon and herself, losing her temper near explosively in the commons and dragging Fyros off to yell at himi about some disagreement she was having with the what Reeve Xena may or may not have known. Seems someone is of the opinion that she attacks the wrong targets with her anger, one-sidedly refuses to hear any information about a situation other than her own, and rejects that she might not know everything.", "I hear mister Geradan complained about the plan to deal with the bandits the entire length of the expedition. Isn't that something you usually do beforehand?", "Bantering is one thing, but Kafka was witnessed talking to a lass in the commons, asking for a kiss while saying he tasted like candy and indicated his groin. This is another perfect example of what not to do in public, and how not to be if you've any inclination of climbing the social ladder.", "Master Ekalah recently took time to do a rush order for Doctor Hush, managing to make excellent quality shields that she desperately needed. He didn't complain once, nor did he charge anything extra for the hurry. Maybe those rumors about him being overpriced and selfish aren't true at all ..", "Geradan waited until the last minute to worry about the bandit expedition strategy, and then when he was told about it he stated he was only there to put the pointies in the bandits anyway. If you have nothing to do with a strategy in the first place, and then have no intention of following a strategy anyway, then why ask about it at all?", "I heard during the bandit expedition that mister Cullan butted into a conversation between Geradan and Reeve Xena that had nothing to do with him. After he interjected he apparently didn't know the answers to the questions being asked anyway, so it was merely pointless rudeness. He really should learn to keep his comments to himself unless someone is speaking to him.", "Those who went on the bandit expedition are cheering mister Ramsford for his preparedness. Apparently he anticipated the needs of others, and gave out blankets and food to those who failed to bring warmth and sustenance along.", "More people speak about how mister Ramsford mingled with all those present during the bandit expedition, and took to mothering everyone by handing out provisions to those who forgot bits and pieces, including blankets and pillows.", "Woo .. I heard Geradan rudely told Captain Carlon and Captain Brenner to shut up during the bandit expedition, instead of asking them simply to be respectful so people nearby could pray. There's a right way to do things and a wrong way.", "I guess Geradan took it upon himself to repeatedly interrupt the war council as they were finalizing the plans for the attack on the bandits. Many of the people present weren't too appreciative of all the noise and rudeness.", "Lieutenant Sunta is being praised for taking time away from her troops during the bandit expedition to make sure Lady Aria was properly schooled with pointers on how to use her rapier for the battle. It's never too late to get an education!", "Paladin Noire took time to say a prayer before the bandit attack, despite Geradan causing a ruckus with unnecessary comments. It's a good thing the Church has someone capable of representing them in a positive light.", "I hear Lady Aria gave quite the motivational speech on the bandit expedition in an effort to bolster the spirits of the troops. There's nothing like a good string of words to get the blood flowing!", "Sir Bayard is being commended for his ability to stay on top of his men during the bandit expedition, who were undoubtedly some of the most well-disciplined in attendance and most prepared for battle.", "Captain Carlon did an excellent job of guiding and directing the Rinaldi troops during the bandit expedition. They seemed to be kept in order and were constantly listening to his commands.", "More gossip about Geradan and the bandit expedition! I'm told he made quite the scene when people attempted to set up a barricade, even challenging Kafka to a duel. Talk about the least inappropriate time to do something of that nature, really.", "When the men on the bandit expedition started acting stupidly and began arguing amongst themselves, Sir Bayard is said to have utilized his Lieutenants swiftly to quell the problem, much to everyone's relief.", "It was acknowledged during the bandit expedition that when given orders from other House's Nobles, Lieutenant Sunta continued to act swiftly and without argument, just as any good soldier should.", "I'm told Doctor Hush did a brilliant job of handling the healers on the bandit expedition, setting up camp in preparation of the onslaught, and healing injured friends and others throughout the chaotic event.", "I'm told Lia did a wonderful job of healing others during the bandit expedition, despite being seriously wounded herself. On top of that, she was the only who could manage to calm Geradan whenever he started causing a ruckus, which is a job in and of itself.", "Miss Bekka took to healing during the bandit expedition, patching up the assassin squad led by Fyros after the battle. I hear she turned out to be a surprisingly good fighter, as well, assisting them to be victorious over the enemy.", "During the bandit expedition, miss Bekka was said to have taken a lickin', but kept on tickin'. She got knocked down quite a few times by the enemy, but continued to get up and press onward, even to the point of saving her companions in the process.", "People are swooning over the keen eyes of Ramsford. During the bandit expedition, his perceptiveness is said to have led to the deaths of several disciplined mercenaries who attempted a surprise attack in the woods on Fyros' team of assassins.", "Guess Clover has taken to using foul and irreverant language in the presence of women again, and in a public place, no less. He was said to have been talking about S'allumers balls, and no doubt it had nothing to do with games of any sort.", "Doctor Hush managed to display some very impressive healing skills and even treated people for poison on the spot during the bandit expedition.", "Miss Lia managed to display some very impressive healing skills during the bandit expedition, despite being seriously wounded herself. Hooray for selflessness and determination!", "During the bandit expedition, it's said that mister Ramsford saved Bekka from certain death, and even managed to do it with a dramatic flair. With or without style, putting yourself in harms way for someone else is admirable.", "Captain Brenner fought valiantly during the bandit expedition and assisted Captain Carlon when he became injured during the brawl. He watched the backs of everyone involved in the skirmish, whether he liked them or not. Now that's just good soldiering.", "Say what you want about Lady Aria, but the fact of the matter is she stood bravely beside her troops, despite her rank and lack of training in combat. Her fearlessness is something to be admired.", "Captain Carlon was truly a sight to behold on the bandit expedition. I hear he fought like a crazed beast, and took horrible injuries but refused to give up until he saw the Reeve to safety!", "Captain Carlon acted selflessly, putting his life on the line to defend Reeve Xena against bandits.", "Lieutenant Sunta put her life on the line and fought valiantly during the bandit expedition. It's said that she followed orders promptly and managed to even see to the safety of her Noble, Lady Aria, and the others in attendance.", "Captain Brenner acted selflessly, putting his life on the line to defend Reeve Xena against bandits.", "Sir Bayard brought his troops on the bandit expedition to help rescue a Rinaldi scoutsman, personally assisted in eliminating the bandit thread, and held a commanding attitude throughout which helped give direction to everyone involved in the skirmish.", "Sir Bayard took it upon himself to see to Lady Aria after the bandit bandit battle was concluding and ensured she had a pleasant place to rest and that her wounds were tended to. Nevermind that the pleasant place was in his arms..", "Mister Kafka made a valiant effort to get Lady Aria free from a snare trap during the bandit expedition, risking his own safety to do so. While the Lady didn't completely escape harm, many are convinced that he prevented her from suffering more serious injuries.", "Fyros, with the aid of Bekka and Ramsford, seemed to pull off a successful attempt at flushing out the bandits recently, despite suffering an ambush in the woods. He seems to be a pretty handy fellow to have around.", "Bekka, with the aid of Fyros and Ramsford, seemed to pull off a successful attempt at flushing out the bandits recently, despite suffering an ambush in the woods. She seems to be a good sort of person to have around.", "Ramsford, with the aid of Fyros and Bekka, seemed to pull off a successful attempt at flushing out the bandits recently, despite suffering an ambush in the woods. He seems to be a good sort of person to have around.", "While Bekka might have done a lot of good things during the bandit expedition, I heard she also disobeyed orders and ran about a dangerous area rigged with traps. Consequently, a spike trap got set off that injured many people. It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt!", "During the entirety of the negotiation and bandit conflict, Captain Prideaux kept a level head and listened to the orders he was given. Yay for not stirring the pot.", "Captain Kaine supported Captain Carlon's every word while they dealt with the bandit envoy recently. He knew these hooligans weren't to be trifled with. Isn't that the kind of man everyone wants at their side? A pragmatic one?", "Sir Bayard is certainly a brilliant military mind. Left with the command of the builk of the Houses military forces, he conducted himself admirably. The villains were routed and the casualties were minimal, making the expedition a success on the whole.", "Deft and able, Fyros came charging to the rescue when it seemed the tide was turning against Reeve Xena, and Captains Brenner, Kaine, and Carlon. His quick action may very well have saved all of their lives.", "Deft and able, Bekka came charging to the rescue when it seemed the tide was turning against Reeve Xena, and Captains Brenner, Kaine, and Carlon. Her quick action may very well have saved all of their lives.", "Deft and able, Ramsford came charging to the rescue when it seemed the tide was turning against Reeve Xena, and Captains Brenner, Kaine, and Carlon. His quick action may very well have saved all of their lives.", "Captain Kaine lent his services as Captain to join Reeve Xena in the negotiation process against the bandits. It was a very admirable thing to do.", "Faithful Lieutenant that she is, Sunta conducted herself well in the grueling battle with the bandit forces, despite sustained injuries from cowardly archers in the woods.", "Doctor Hush worked diligently to ensure wounded soldiers were able and fit for battle, despite injuries she herself suffered during the bandit expedition. One can only marvel at her skills, as it's said she even had time in between her healing to light a purple votive candle for Lady Aria.", "Miss Lia worked diligently to ensure wounded soldiers were able and fit to battle during the bandit expedition, despite having taken injuries herself.", "During the bandit battle, Hush was one of the many fine healers providing medical care to the warriors. Through her efforts, people were able to carry on fighting to protect Lady Aria and Reeve Xena.", "Captain Kaine killed many bandits, even engaging the enemy bandit boss and coming out unscathed. That panther is a credit to his House's famous reputation of being deadly on the battlefield.", "Paladin Noire saw to the emotional well-being of the survivors of the bandit fight through prayer and her peaceful presence. This was after she slew many foes, of course.", "For leading the bandit plot and being ever patient with all the players and scenes. Well done!", "Captain Carlon did a good job of leading the Rinaldi during the bandit expedition. He remained ever calm and collected during the chaos.", "Captain Kaine did a good job of leading the Bisclavret during the bandit expedition. He remained ever calm and collected during the chaos.", "Say what you will about Captain Brenner, but on the battlefield he refused to leave a hurt Captain Carlon behind, despite being told to go repeatedly.", "Seems Fyros managed to do a gentlemanly thing and gave Dazrene a discrete heads-up about Captain Carlon's condition after the bandit expedition.", "Some Nobles and commoners agree that Lady Aria was a needless and distracting risk during the bandit expedition. Protecting her was said to draw three or more of the best fighters available from the main battle, and she drew the attention of more than just one healer at any given time. People gossip that the Lady just had no reason to be there, and that she risked the lives of hundreds of men by her presence, not to mention risking her own Reeve and many other men simply for the sake of rescuing a single commoner.", "What a gal that Lia is! I hear she told Geradan to protect Lady Aria during the bandit attack, rather than following and protecting her. What selflessness and sensibility! She sure suffered for it too, getting stabbed, poisoned, and sliced, all while trying to heal other soldiers. Who knows what would have happened if Geradan had abandoned Lady Aria with Mama Borgia Mia heading straight for her?", "Doctor Hush made sure everyone else got looked at first after the bandit expedition before allowing herself to be tended. If that isn't dedication to the job, then I dunno what is.", "Lia was right behind Doctor Hush, making sure everyone else was fixed up after the bandit expedition before bothering with herself. She certainly should be commended by her owner.", "Kafka's repeated attempts to pick a fight with Geradan during the bandit expedition was distracting to those trying to watch for danger, and he made it a point to ignore several attempts by his superiors to get him to stop. Really, there's a time and place for such things.", "While he is indeed trying hard to curve his bad habits, there was no excuse for Geradan's bad behavior toward his superiors at the bandit site. I hear he demanded that Sir Bayard stop talking and even told Lady Aria to mind her own business. Someone still needs to learn his place.", "That Captain Prideaux is the very picture of a gallant Avoirdupois squire! Not only did he risk his life to protect the Rinaldi Reeve and rescue the hostage, sustaining multiple injuries in the process, but he took on dozens of bandits to get Captain Carlon to safety also!", "No wonder Captain Kaine is being named Lord Blackburne's squire! Not only was he involved in planning tactics and strategy for the bandit expedition, but he bravely risked his life to rescue the hostage and protect the Rinaldi Reeve. I hear quite a number of bandits met their end at his hands ...", "Not only is Paladin Noire a pillar of faith and leadership, leading the entire expedition in prayer for the success of the mission, but she also risked her life to save Baron Marcus - twice! Further, she intervened in quite a few arguments between the fighters, managing to break things up peaceably. She should be commended for her efforts.", "Lieutenant Sunta sure is an amazing fighter! Not only dids he organize the building of a defensive barricade around the ally camp, but she continually risked her life to protect the Lady Aria, sustaining multiple injuries in the process.", "That mister Ramsford! Not only did he bring all manner of provisions to support the fighters, he also risked his life as part of the rescue squad to retrieve the Rinaldi Reeve and the hostage! It almost makes up for him foolishly triggering that trap and wounding the already-injured fighters after the battle was over.", "The church ought to be proud of Paladin Khagra. I hear nobody defeated more bandits than he did. Why, he was practically a one-man army, defeating any and all foes who attempted to harm hiim or his allies. Methinks someone deserves a medal, both for risking themself, and for being so good at combat!", "I'm sure all those who went on the bandit expedition were glad Doctor Rose was with them. First she organized the temporary infirmary in the midst of the camp, and then repeatedly risked her life to heal the injured and protect Lady Aria! If it weren't for her, a lot more soldiers would likely have died from poison or blood loss. She ought to be commended.", "I hear that if it weren't for Fyros and the ambush he led, the Reeve Xena and that hostage would have never made it out alive! His team killed one of the bandit leaders, and wounded and killed dozens of other bandits! Someone definitely proved their worth in battle, and should be rewarded for it.", "That Captain Carlon! Seriously wounded in the line of duty, and yet he still managed to take on dozens of bandits before he was felled! Someone deserves a medal!", "Despite Doctor Hush not feeling well herself, she is still taking the time to follow up with and ensure that everyone from the bandit expedition is recovering and getting proper treatment.", "That mister Martin sure does seem to have a keen mind. I hear he informed a newcomer on why Triskellian is a trade center for the land of Calabria, and continued to display a firm understanding of the purpose of the city, and the relationship between the Houses. If only everyone was so willing to educate new arrivals in the more important aspects of city life!", "Sir Bayard reportedly protected Doctor Hush on her way to healing the injured during the bandit attack. His strength and martial abilities ensured the survival of many allies!", "While Kafka is known to be grouchy, he took it upon himself to argue with Geradan due to stress during the bandit expedition. He was asked multiple times to stop arguing and literally had to be threatened before he would stop fighting with his own allies.", "Cavalier Bayard may be good in battle, but he's reportedly poor at running a Household. He's apparently cracking the whip in regards to house trading, and taken his entire Household to task over what they import, and how they spend their coin, calling the rich wines and the lush fabrics that are so symbolic of the Avoirdupois 'frivolous'. Rumor has it he even took action to try and discipline a Baron of higher standing!", "I hear Lady Aria took to quarreling with Chatelaine Nan in the west commons about social and house ranks, rather than taking the issue somewhere more private and having a calm discussion. Such displays are inappropriate for a Noble.", "How rude! When Lady Aria suggested that a memorial service be held for those who died in the bandit battle, Sir Althalus took it upon himself to write the Lady for permission to host it himself. When she told him that she had already spoken to a Paladin about doing just that and invited him to join the planning, he decided to simply make a public announcement about the one he was hosting himself. Does he have such a need to socially climb that he attempts to usurp already planned events just so that he might have credit?", "Brie made sure that her husband, Ramsford, was prepared for the bandit adventure by providing blankets, pillow, food, and comfortable clothing.  Just like a wife is supposed to.", "Xena doesn't have any problems arguing in the commons with Carlon, acting like they had just broken up and talking about loin rubbing...", "Ramsford likes to mingle when he's out on the road, making sure everyone enjoys the comforts of home!", "Sunta doesn't mind giving fencing pointers to nobles on their first military venture.  It's never too late to get an education in combat with her around.", "Geradan doesn't like to take orders, I hear.  When a group went to find bandits, he complained the entire time about not knowing the plan or giving backtalk to those how had authority over him.  Thank goodness he went along.", "Bayard respectably commanded his troops through the journey to the bandit site and actively engaged in hashing out strategy and plan details with other expedition leaders.", "Fyros managed to seem confident in his portion of the strategy to find bandits, kept his troops updated and informed on their responsibilities, how things should play out, and so on.  He showed really good leadership!", "Despite not being part of a Great House, Bekka volunteered to come on the bandit expedition and was more than willing to fight for the cause, joining a group of assassins.  Grr grr, get the bandits.", "Despite not being part of a Great House, Bekka volunteered to come on the bandit expedition and was more than willing to fight for the cause, joining a group of assassins.", "Aria gave a good, encouraging speech to motivate and uplift the troops fighting to save a Rinaldi man.  It was quite befitting for someone of the nobility to take command and do so.", "Handling the situation with aplomb, Aria kept control of the troops, even though she must be quite nervous about her task.", "Of the three Captains that escorted Xena on her mission, Brenner was the only one to actually listen to and obey her orders.", "Ramsford guarded Xena while she was dragging the hostage from the bandit camp!  He protected her the entire way with little concern for his own well-being.", "Fyros managed to bring reinforcements in the nick of time, burning the bandit camp to aid the Captains and Xena in their retrieval of the hostage Espio.  Now if only I could find a pyromaniac with that kind of dedication.", "Bayard really put himself on the line to save a Rinaldi scout from the bandits!", "Xena was diplomatic and calm during the entire bandit ordeal.  When the fight broke out?  She was determined to save the hostage and work swiftly to cut his bonds!", "After Aria was wounded fighting bandits, Bayard was her blanket.  He cradled her against his chest, ensuring she was warm and felt safe, and was protected.  So chivalrous of him!", "Xena really put herself at risk, offering to be kidnapped by bandits and managing to pull it off without the death of herself or anyone of importance.", "Sunta took a great many injuries during the bandit expedition and ensured the safety of Lady Aria throughout.  What a trooper.", "Xena is modest to a fault when receiving accolades, even if they are in regard to a military victory she was the architect of!", "Xena saw to the comfort and health of all the combatants after the bandit battle.  Awww.  Thoughtful much?", "Hush tended to Xena and anybody else who was injured by bandits.  With care and skill no less.  The fact that she came along when she was clearly against the entire plan was admirable in and of itself.  That's how you get ahead, shut up and keep your head down!", "You know what Auron did?  He strolled right up to Xena after she got back from fighting bandits and asked how his sword was coming along!  Oh sure, he was willing to wait for the work to be done.  But he didn't even bother to say hello, how are you, nothing.  What a pud.", "Sunta Hare with legs up to her hair.", "Lia's a helpful sort of slave.  She doesn't mind taking the time to explain House standards, propriety, the basics of clothing, and even offers to help teach people how to speak Calabrese.  And all this for people who aren't associated with her owner's House!  How great!", "You know what Cullan is good at?  Butting his way into conversations.  During a military expedition no less!  He likes to talk about how he knows what the strategies are, especially when he doesn't know the strategies.  Never you mind shouting to drown out his superiors.", "Kafka is usually pretty insufferable.  Ask anyone.  Even his friends hate him.  But on the bandit expedition, he fought bravely and represented his House well.  Kudos!", "Care packages!  Brie made care packages for the troops going to fight bandits!  Care packages show you care.  Brie must really care.", "Love her or hate her, Xena had the safety of everyone foremost in her mind.  Even the people you think she doesn't care about.  Even when it was clear that the expedition had been deceived she was more focused on negotian than combat.", "Boars need love too.", "Oink, oink.  The other white meat.", "Despite having issues with him, mister Geradan has been most tolerant with mister Kafka and has been kind enough to not bring charges against him out of respect for the Bisclavret. I hear he intends to settle things one-on-one with Kafka rather than making a big to-do out of the whole affair. If I knew what the issue was exactly, I might brag more.", "I hear mister Greeves tried to trick miss Gemma into marriage using a cursed armband, and caused quite the scene due to it. Pretty sad if that's the only way he can get a woman, especially in a city so full of them.", "It seems Deputy Krell has taken to bad-mouthing Presbyter Ximen in public areas. Does the Constabulary have something against the Church all of the sudden, or is this a case of a Constable gone wild?", "After all the trouble that went into getting Chinco arrested, and all the talk about him refusing to lay down his arms when he was told he couldn't have them, the Sheriff failed to even ask mister Chinco to disarm when he took him into the jail proper. Oye, the Constabulary these days.", "Even after losing an honorable duel, mister Ilo refused to hold to the terms of said duel. Everyone knows better than to do that, honorable or otherwise.", "Captain Carlon has recently taken to teaching it seems, busying himself with correcting mister Kafka's behavior in public areas. Most recently, it was said that Kafka was teaching a female bad words in the commons and the Captain called him on it.", "While one can understand standing behind your employees, miss Bekka has taken it to an extreme, choosing to believe in mister Ilo's words rather than in the law, despite several cases being filed against him by the Constabulary alongside whole explanations with reasonings about the crimes that occurred and the consequences thereof.", "Miss Bekka seems to be persistent in harrassing the Constabulary about trying to get mister Ilo to file his testimony, even after repeatedly being told that the law works in a certain way, and individuals can't be proven innocent if they don't speak up for themselves.", "The Lord Baron very wisely called attention recently to the possibility of miss Una witnessing something potentially inappropraite at Baron Edmond's social. I hear the theme was named debauchery, and that it was hardly an event for a young girl's eyes.", "Despite being impaired by her lack of sight and not knowing the names of places, she offered to give miss Nasrin a tour of the city using her limited perception of smell. I'm certain that was quite the interesting tour!", "If you don't want your business heard, it's best not to conduct it around the Newtown courier, as Doctor Hush was said to be doing. Apparently a Noble took offense to her whispering and instructing her fellow cohorts to do the same while in the Noble's presence. Quite a rude and tactless display, especially when followed by leaving without so much as asking for leave or excusing yourself.", "I hear Doctor Hush offered cash prizes for the treasure hunt out of her very own pocket and was donating all the proceeds from the silent auction straight to charity. How generous of her!", "It seems rather high-handed of Captain Kaine to go around claiming Deputy Zaria as part of his Household. The Constables of a Rinaldi city are to remain unaffiliated with Households in order to do their duty neutrally and without bias. I hope he doesn't make her look bad to her superiors!", "What is with mister Chesh? Just read the case file on him and you'll see that not only did he threaten to assassinate and outright attack a Noble, but he also insulted the Constabulary while he was doing it! Really, just who raised this man? He's not going to last very long in town if he continues with this kind of behavior.", "Poor weasel, always being talked about. Rumor has it that he was stuck between filing testimony on his own behalf, and upholding the terms of an honorable duel. I hear he did his best to figure out a way to help explain his situation without breaking the terms of his agreement, and in the end, he decided to withhold testimony on his own behalf just to be sure he didn't say anything wrong. It's a pretty swell guy that will go to jail just to be sure he doesn't dishonor himself.", "While Chinco may be a well-known criminal and stubborn to boot, he did finally give up his weapons to the Constabulary. Is he simply afraid of losing his handsome head, or is he finally taking a step in the right direction? Hard to tell with that one.", "Mister Virendra certainly isn't the sharpest tool in the barn. So quickly after getting that brand on his forehead, he seems to be up to his old habits again. Implicated for murder? Another murder he was convicted for? I don't think that brand taught him anything at all.", "Miss Nan apparently agreed to provide the Constabulary with a list of which person was wearing what mask to the Avoirdupois social gathering. She aimed to keep the list private, but also ensure that nobody was able to do anything rotten while disguised. Everyone should be commending her for both her discretion and her concern for public safety.", "While Biggs has been left in charge of the Constabulary, he is rarely available for business, never answers his scrolls, and doesn't take the time to properly induct Deputies. Why, I hear Zaria has been working for the Constabulary for moons, and was never even told the first thing about her job!", "Did you hear? Lord Adrien allowed the slave, Lia, to act as the representative of the Doloreaux embassy at the Bisclavret social. Talk about inappropriate!", "Lord Adrien was said to have given a very inspiring speech at the Bisclavret social that encouraged unity amongst the four Houses.", "Some of the Nobility were a tidbit concerned about Lord Adrien's speech at the Bisclavret social. Rumors have it that he encouraged people to gorge themselves on large portions of food and become nearly too drunk to walk home. That sort of encouragement likely isn't what you want to be giving to Nobles, house members, and favored persons of the city, even if done in jest.", "People are raving about what a good shindig Lady Georgianna put on, and are commending her for actually getting senior members from all the Houses to attend. I hear the booze was flowing pretty good too, so that probably helped people's enjoyment of the event.", "Among a Lady, Rinaldi Reeve, various other commoners, and skinks, Lord Adrien chose to dance with a -slave- at his social instead of picking from one of the many other options.", "I understand miss Lia is a particularly friendly slave, but she shouldn't be allowing a Lord to embarrass himself at his own social by taking her to the dance floor before all of the other ranked females.", "Lady Georgianna was a good hostess at the Bisclavret Social. People say she was warm, welcoming, that she chatted with guests, and was generally a pleasure to be around.", "How rude to interrupt two Ladies engaged in conversation. Reports say Lady Georgianna and Lady Aria were discussing the recent flurry of socials at the Bisclavret event, and mister Clover just jumped right in with a topic change. Surely he could have waited until the conversation was concluded.", "Baron Edmond was forced to introduce himself to Willem the Falconer while speaking to Lord Adrien, Lady Georgianna and himself collectively. How rude is that? Nobles should know the rules of courtesy and make introductions accordingly.", "People understood Zaria wanting to shaer her love of the arts at the Bisclavret social, but reciting a poem and expecting folks to be quiet and listen when they were already engaged in other discussions was just too much, especially after Zaria was already told to wait for people to conclude their business. It was rude and inappropriate on the whole.", "Participated in the treasure hunt, and despite having difficulty with a problem, she refused to give up. Stubbornness, at times, can be something to admire.", "That treasure hunt Doctor Hush put on sure sounded like fun! All of it led to a party for charity too, so she was entertaining people and helping out the less fortunate. What a nice woman!", "Rumor has it that Paladin Noire stood silently by when Carolyn returned from the dead and was being taken away from public company by not only a heretic, but someone under suspicion for killing her. Isn't it the Church's job to watch over the faithful and the heretical both?", "When learning of mister Virendra's suspicion of killing miss Carolyn, she didn't hesitate to take up charge concerning the two going off alone.", "Miss Lotis took time out of her own schedule to clearn up the mess left on Market Street by people seeing to mister Ilo. Though such cleaning is the job of slaves, she was quite generous in volunteering and following through.", "Mister Auron was overheard talking about being exposed to the girl he's courting in the middle of the commons! How scandalous, even for Docktown. Keep some of your conversations for private, please.", "It's very Noble of Lia, slave or not, to hold true to her promise to miss Temperance and mister Zeiss, that even after Temperance's death, she continues to make sure Yulien, her child, is still taken care of.", "Captain Kaine assuaged mister Geradan by offering to talk to the Bisclavret Nobles about mister Kafka, who refused Geradan's challenge to duel via scroll. Smart thing that, since it would bring dishonor to the whole House if Geradan had to challenge Kafka more publicly.", "Polgara had a few people go with her to help find something she had lost. Even though they weren't able to find it, she paid the people for helping anyway. Now that's a good woman!", "Lady Aria is ever polite to those in her House, both in greeting them and in ensuring they are kept up to date with what's going on in the embassy.", "Despite past grievances with Sir Matteo, Lord Marcus was kind enough to welcome him back with open arms and a smile. If only everyone was party to such warm reunions.", "For once, mister Geradan took the lawful approach. In dealing with mister Kafka, when constantly goaded and called a heretic, he challenged the guard to a duel and laid out the terms clearly, as written by Mercutio di Rinaldi on the public boards. Handling things appropriately really pays off.", "Mister Kafka not only refused a duel with Geradan, but also accused the paladin of heresy, and sent him a soiled scroll as a finishing touch. Even for a Bisclavret guard, that's hardly appropriate or acceptable behavior.", "Miss Carolyn is apparently very kind. I hear she'll buy and donate things for and to the needy, even going so far as to deliver them into nasty places like the jailhouse just to make sure they are received by the proper party.", "Miss Madaline returned again to the city, and all she could do was shout orders at people to leave her presence. She even snapped at the Rinaldi Reeve, and ordered Guardsman Breeze to arrest mister Ilo for no apparent reason. Who does that woman think she is anyway? The Dona?", "Mister Virendra went into the commons making it a point to announce that he was wearing nothing but a comforter. While skimpy garb is regularly worn in Docktown, turning yourself into a spectacle in a public area to garner attention due to lack of clothing is hardly appropriate.", "When mister Virendra came out into the commons wearing nothing but a comforter, Gentleman Clover started making ribald jokes about Virendra's private bits, and even insinuated that people would want to see them. Aren't ranked members of society supposed to be good examples of behavior?", "Miss Bekka might like to claim her guild is different, but people believe she's just another in a chain of leaders who tries to recruit every single person the moment they step through the city gates rather than give them time to figure out the best direction to take. It might work for some, but others find bad fits and just end up leaving entirely.", "Upon entering the commons, Sir Althalus didn't even bother to acknowledge Lady Aria as protocol dictates. Instead, he simply turned heel and walked the other way! What a rude, curt gentleman.", "When miss Dahlia was desperately in need of kohl for her pagan social costume, mister Brenner didn't hesitate to send it to her in her hour of need. I guess if you need makeup, you know who to beg now.", "Miss Noe is most shrewd when it comes to business dealings. Not only does she have excessive skills with garments and hair, but she is able to skillfully negotiate favors and trade in exchange for said skills. Clearly she's a credit to her household.", "I hear at the pagan social Baron Edmond proclaimed his love for Lady Aria when she was too drunk to comprehend what he was saying. He even took vows with her of some sort while she was in that state. What sort of Noble takes advantage of another in that sort of situation? Shame on him!", "That mister Velasco has absolutely no manners whatsoever! He reportedly harrassed Guardswoman Breeze by placing his hand on her backsside despite her constant protests! He's just lucky it happened in Docktown instead of Newtown, or people would -really- have made an issue out of it. Clearly his lack of respect for women is already being acknowledged.", "For a Squire, she really is representing her Knight disfavorably by hanging around wit hthe excommunicated Harken Zeiss and joking about being killed by his hand in the commons.", "Squire Donatella's name continues to float around the gossip circle as she tries to find excuses to go up to mister Zeiss' rooms. Any girl going up there deserves whatever she gets after all his escapades, but for a Bisclavret Squire to pursue that course of action? Definitely bad form.", "Miss Donatella associates with an excommunicated man, mister Zeiss, and refuses to see how that might reflect on her person and house in a negative way. While the church does approve of people wanting to reach out and help him, she didn't make any mention of how her association with him accomplishes that. Her only justification at all was that, as a merchant, he has wares nobody else does. Sell your soul for a trinket anyone?", "When informed that people were publicly speaking about her relationship with mister Zeiss, miss Omen was quite rude and insisted that she be called Captain even though she possesses no rank whatsoever. She further threatened to take a Constable to task for warning her that her name was being bandied about in association with his.", "Miss Dahlia was wise enough to heed the words of the Constables when saving the life of Doctor Hush. They told everyone who weren't strong swimmers to stay on shore, and she stuck back and kept mister Fips from suffering the same fate as the Doctor.", "Girl fight! I hear miss Aradhyl was flirting inappropriately with mister Fyros in the commons, and in the presence of his suitor, Zaria. She was commenting on the subject of men always trying to get her out of her skirts due to mister Fyros requesting she not wear one while undergoing combat training with him. Did she cross the ilne by being disrespectful or were her words misconstrued out of touchiness? Either way, such jokes aren't for everyone - remember that.", "Despite knowing miss Emma was blind, and despite seeing her dressed only in her undergarments in public, he didn't say a word to her out of care of concern. You'd think such a long-standing member of the Bisclavret would be more of a gentleman and not visually take advantage of the situation.", "Sheriff Biggs rarely replies to scrolls in an acceptable amount of time and claims to do the paperwork that others in the Constabulary do themselves. There were cases that reportedly hadn't been closed for over a year, so those with pending punishments had to deal with them well past the time they should have. Not to mention there are several recruits of over a month waiting to be brought into the guard itself because the Sheriff has just been too lazy to get to it. All in all, he makes for a terrible person for that particular position, or so they're saying. Step it up, man, show them what you can do!", "When Doctor Hush took ill with poison, Dylan used his limited skills to the best of his ability to identify the problem and help deal with it.", "Now folk in Docktown like a good a good brawl and don't really mind Constables getting a little taste of their own medicine, but if you're going to draw weapons, you should at least have some excuse more than boredom.", "Volunteering to second Ilo in a duel and teach him the rules of it so he could handle it honorably. Apparently she has her own moments of honor as well.", "Ilo always seems to be in the midst of trouble, usually involving weapons, and then complains about it later. What did he expect when Jarek was already attacking Fyros and he accused Fyros of an attack in the sewers with no evidence by a vague memory of a dagger. He refused to press charges. He refused to stop, and when he was challenged to a duel over it, he complained about that too.", "After a long day of duels, brawls, fights and other nonsense, Doctor Hush tended the assorted injuries without complaint and without seeking coin. She spent hours at her labors. Healers can be so underappreciated.", "You never know what to expect from those new to town, but Aster did well helping out a bunch of wounded in the infirmary and having a gentle touch with Zaria. She made sure everyone was okay until a more experienced healer showed up.", "Let her employee draw blade and pick a fight for no real reason in the commons without trying to stop him, even drawing blade to defend him if it came to it. That's taking responsibility for your employees' actions.", "Apparently a lot of people noticed Jarek's unsolicited violence against the wounded Zaria and then to her defender when Fyros stepped in. If you're going to attack people out of the blue, at least try and do it in an alley or the Docks. That's almost what they're for.", "Xena, the fine Rinaldi aristocrat dueled Ilo on behalf of Fyros's honor with the terms that Ilo would recant his accusations about Fyros' attack. Fighting on behalf of another's honor can be honorable in it own right and suited to someone of station, or she must really feel something for Fyros to protect him so. You be the judge.", "She did her job well and worked to save a number of people while keeping good cheer the night of the Daemon constellation.", "Best be careful of that Fyros, he'll act like your friend but he'll still turn on you and even try to kill you in an instant. Watch your back, specially in the dark.", "Doctor Hush really put a lot of work into her Treasure Hunt in order to make fun for the participants.", "Captain Kaine realizes that a leader worries about every single person under his command. He regularly visited the infirmary to check on wounded guards and troops, including Tork.", "Breeze is a good and fair constable, appreciated for her thoughtfulnes and investigating accusations rather than just rushing ahead blindly with each one.", "Lady Georgianna was very considerate during the Bisclavret social to provide non alcoholic drinks for those of gentler disposition or sensibilities.", "Lord Adrien's speech at the Bisclavret social reinforced the sentiment which is often forgotten, the importance of the Houses working and coming together.", "Zaria was thoughtful enough to bring some Bisclavret poetry to their cultural social and recite it.", "Lady Georgianna's complaints that her husband doesn't hire chefs and cooks, but rather requests to only eat gruel and porridge would have been a minor comment, if only she hadn't said it to others of station who took note and raised eyebrows.", "Did you see the clothing Gemma was wearing at the Bisclavret banquet? Sharing your culture is one thing, but dressing like a Maison worker is another.", "Lord Edmond took the time to give Paladin Noire a dancing lesson during a social so that she might be more prepared for such events in the future.", "Captain Kaine escorted Lady Aria and Xena safely back to their rooms when no others were present to do so. It was especially thoughtful considering Xena was inebriated and could have easily fallen to harm without a guard nearby.", "It was quite thoughtful of Xena to suggest that the leftover food  from the Bisclavret social be donated to the poor.  We should always be thinking of those less  fortunate than ourselves.", "Yes, we get it you want people to know you're in looooove, but Auron really should have a little discretion. All the cuddling and touching right out in the commons is too much, but kissing Olena while folk are passing by is a bit much.", "Olena should really stop letting Auron snuggle, grope and kiss her right out in the commons in front of everyone all the time. Its not the place.", "Sang played incredibly well with a multitude of instruments for the Bisclavret social, From Bagpipes to a harpsichord, he can play it all with perfection.", "Fyros helped Doctor Hush with her treasure hunt, giving an especially interesting math problem for people to solve.", "For giving her money free to someone she knew very little about! The youngest daughter of thirteen never had much for herself, so Brie was very generous to treat Nasrin like so.", "Fyros is ever respectful and courteous.  While his position is that of personal body guard to the Lady Grazia, he always looks out not only for the members of his House, but for everyone in the town as well.  His brusque demeanor hides a deep loyalty to those around him. He even sacrificed his entire savings to help finance part of the expedition against the bandits.", "What a fool, goin to the jail peacefully woulda earned him some good words for his benefit, but instead he turns and attacks Zaria. The Bisclavret must be ashamed.", "Licking on Carolyn's ear in public, and inviting himself up to her room when she mentioned she was going to go upstairs and work on clothing for someone. Rude, and oh so naughty!", "Sir Matteo approached Xena about some rumors he heard regarding her, and was seemingly genuine in his concern about her happiness with the Household. It was a different Matteo than the one from years past who blabbed everyone's business to anyone who would listen.", "At risk to his own life, Fyros swam out into the riptide to save Doctor Hush from drowning a death on the bottom of the ocean.", "Despite being teased and flirted with by Fyros and Zaria together, she didnt get angry and throw a fit. She just asked to leave respectfully. She was challenged to act up and passed, she really is handling herself well lately.", "Kaine escorted Xena all the way back to her room because of her inebriation at Fyros' request. What a gentleman. Now the Rinaldi reeve being so drunk she repeatedly needs an escort to her rooms is another matter.", "Whispers say that Lady Aria and Baron Edmond have been going into one another's rooms without proper chaperones. While they have largely been successful in avoiding rumors altogether through discretion, this time they were caught by a sneaky Paladin who brought up the inappropriateness of the situation right in the middle of the commons, and in front of another Noble no less! Rule of thumb: If you're of station and don't want scandal surrounding you, don't enter a private room with someone of the opposite gender unless there's a third party available to attend.", "Seems people don't care too awful much about Nobles sneaking off together, but they do care if said Nobles get caught while doing it! Some lessons in subtlety seem to be in order for the Rinaldi's Lady Aria and the Avoirdupois' Baron Edmond.", "I hear miss Drewe made inappropriate commends during an impromptu meeting with the Interim Sheriff, Biggs, speaking on sharing her uniform with Recruit Kegan, despite the idea of uniforms for recruits being unallowed.", "Miss Omen stayed by Deputy Zaria's bedside the whole time she was on temporary stay in the infirmary, ensuring she was happy and cared for despite not having to. What a nice lass that one is.", "Miss Dahlia stayed by Deputy Zaria's bedside the whole time she was on temporary stay in the infirmary, ensuring she was happy and cared for despite not having to. What a nice lass that one is.", "I hear Kafka threw a temper tantrum in the commons over a couple tumblers of whiskey that were drunk. Was there really any need to lift Ilo by the scruff of his neck and threaten to burn off his face? Probably not .. Was there a need to afterward assault a Constable? Definitely not. The man just seems to be insane.", "Surprise, surprise. When it came to a promise Chinco made to Kafka, he refused to keep it and refrained from joining in on the assault of Deputy Zaria at the request of his boss, Clover LePlow. That's some sway the so-called Docktown Boss holds over Chinco.", "That Drewe sure is a lazy one, mocking other Constables for doing their jobs like she should be doing hers. In particular, I was told she made an inappropriate joke about Zaria's skull being broken and how hilarious it was, then proceeded to comment that she wouldn't ever involve herself in a scene or situation if she was off-duty. Doesn't she know Constables don't get time off?", "People are saying Rosaline isn't friendly at all, especially to other females! Word is that she gets angry if mister Niven talks to anybody else, even men like Clover LePlow, when she's around. Must be some sort of sickness expecting the world to revolve around oneself..", "They say Ford is a man worthy of trust. When a certain weasel was stabbed nearly to death, Ford was there guarding him even after he woke up.", "Mister Clover claims to be generous and helpful to everyone, especially newcomers. He's known for handing out coins to those newly arrived in the city. I hear he gave mister Eiryk 12 denarii so that he could manage his expenses until finding a job. Eiryk was offered one later in the day by miss Bekka who said he could work for her until he found another place. When Clover heard that Eiryk had agreed, he gave Eiryk a chiding and demanded the coins he had given earlier back. They say he never even suggested or asked mister Eiryk to join his guild or do anything in return for the coins to begin with. Why would you give coin to help people out until they find a job only to take it back if a job becomes available and they accept it? Is it possible there are strings attached to these monetary gifts?", "People aren't very happy that Clover is trying to intimidate Bekka by saying he's going to blacklist her guild in Docktown when they claim that all she's doing is trying to help people get settled in the city.", "I hear miss Aradhyl got involved in a conversation between two guildleaders, Bekka and Clover, about their business, even implying that Clover might send thugs after Bekka if she didn't listen or agree with what he was saying. That isn't the most courteous behavior for a member of a House.", "I hear mister Thukal got involved in a conversation between two guildleaders, Bekka and Clover, about their business, and implied the other guilds in town would be too scared of Clover's muscle to do anything, which might have just been an invitation for trouble.", "Bekka, in spite of appearances, is said to offer a wonderful service to those new in the city. For people who feel overwhelmed or a bit lost, she offers a sense of belonging as they find their place. For others, she offers a steady income and teachers along with introductions as they seek a permanent guild or House. While she might receive some benefits from doing these things, she never personally asks for anything from her members and cheers them on whether they wish to leave or stay. That seems a good and noble thing to do, aye?", "Sir Matteo is said to be spreading misinformation about the Rinaldi embassy, including that they never pay him. Further, instead of bringing his concerns about members of the embassy to the embassy itself, he insists on speaking to and in front of outsiders, airing his displeasure publicly. This kind of behavior is hardly befitting the manner a Rinaldi Lord should affect.", "Though Eiryk might be the last straw that caused Clover to be upset with Bekka's guild, he's unlike most new arrivals with no history or interest in about why Clover isn't happy. He actually listened and thought about what was said. A lad that listens and thinks? In this town? Craaazy!", "When hearing of mister Sang's lack of providing proper service to University customers, Doctor Hush offered to handle everything for only half the price of the work. Sang lacked doing a statue for someone for over a year while taking similar projects on before completing that order! Hush is doing well looking after such a difficult case.", "Despite the obvious urge to color the commons with mister Sinjaa's blood and bowels, mister Ford did resist and obey the Constabulary as well as advice from a Housemate to walk away and let the argument drop. What a good show for the Rinaldi House and its Guard!", "Deputy Breeze rescued a less experienced guard from having to try and stop a fight between two large tigers. The poor new recruit was trying to be brave, but it was pretty obvious the relief on her face when Breeze showed up and settled the matter peacefully.", "People seem to truly believe that miss Bekka's guild is made for newcomers to the city as a place for them to earn income and settle in before finding a final guild or house with which to end up. The fact that Clover is said to have blacklisted her for that is causing a mass of raised eyebrows and headshakes from those believing he's gone too far this time. What's he afraid of anyway, that Bekka might gain some power in Docktown?", "Despite being an obviously inexperienced guard  in the Constabulary, miss Aster did her best when ordering Ford and Sinjaa to stop their arguing and take it to the training yard. She kept her cool, but the relief on her face when Guardsman Breeze showed up and took over was pretty apparent. Whispers suggest there might be a good future in store for this one.", "Guardsman Breeze is apparently doing a great job in the Constabulary, and isn't afraid to put her own health and life on the line for her duty. She's said to be very experienced and knows the law and how it works inside and out.", "Mister Ford was heard implying that the Bisclavret didn't do their job correctly in regards to mister Kafka. Others seem to think they did themselves wonders as mister Kafka would have undoubtedly brought shame on the embassy due to his misdeeds.", "Miss Noe stepped up and stepped into the leadership position in House Avoirdupois unofficially. With Sir Bayard not having been around or being inattentive, she kept the House together and helped ensure it didn't become stagnate by encouraging the recruitment of new members, paying incomes out of her own pocket, and arranging for teachers for House members.", "Really?! Standing around in the commons clad in only a bra and pair of very short shorts while being kissed on various parts of her body by a servant boy? Certainly she can't be surprised when she brings all sorts of poor attention onto herself. Maybe the poor girl never had a mother to teach her properly ... awww, that's sad.", "Mister Eiryk volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "Miss Stacy volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "Miss Thaisa volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "Mister Syrith volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "Mister Tark volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "Miss Donatella volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "I heard Guardsman Breeze was urging people to not go look for injured survivors after the initial earthquake, and to only take care of themselves. That doesn't seem very civic minded, does it?", "That Lieutenant Tonozzi! When the earth started shaking, she took it upon herself to go search for injured survivors in need of help, putting their safety before her own! The Bisclavret should be glad to be represented by someone so responsible and selfless!", "Mister Tark was kind enough to make iron shields for everyone during the earthquakes to protect them from falling debris! I'm sure he lost out on some profits, but it was good of him to put the safety of the city before his own business.", "I hear Clover stepped up and organized a rescue operation after the earthquake. Cheers for someone taking the reigns and leading.", "Apparently Mathias was really curt to his housemate Thaisa without even offering explanation as to why he forbade her to ever go help hunt spiders. He never even bothered to ask why she was going or what had happened! That's certainly not the way to build authority within an embassy.", "I hear that mister Fyros went out and searched for people in Docktown after the earthquake hit. How heroic!", "Mister Tarquin stepped up and aided Clover in doing a search for miss Thaisa and Gentleman Mathias who were reported missing after the earthquake hit.", "Miss Stacy stepped up and aided Clover in doing a search for miss Thaisa and Gentleman Mathias who were reported missing after the earthquake hit.", "Apparently miss Thaisa argued with two gentry who came in to help Gentleman Mathias after he was abandoned indoors while napping just after an earthquake. Valuable time was wasted because of this and teh chances everyone might have gotten hurt or killed increased too! People need to know when to shut their yaps!", "That miss Thaisa, I can't believe her! When a member of her House was injured, she lost her temper and told everyone else to leave, saying she'd look after him. When folk got mad about being ordered around by some unknown, rude commoner, she started talking about how he was 'her Protector' and how she 'couldn't leave him' and was 'just trying to help'. Then she up and left the Cathedral in a huff! So much for not being able to leave, eh?", "Deputy Zaria stuck by Dunwasser Fieldway, keeping peace and assisting with the wounded all night and day amidst the ongoing earthquakes. What a fantastic Constable, and how relieving to know there are some good ones working hard for the city!", "Apparently the Church took to gathering the poor and others of Docktown and escorting them to a camp outside the city where they could take care of them. Paladin Iare even let those in Dunwasser Fieldway know in case they needed to move somewhere safe too. Egads, the Church is doing good deeds. Ximen must be horrified!", "Virendra was heard talking about having sex with Carolyn in the refugee camp. He pretended he was just trying to lift people's spirits, but really he was just tarnishing her name and being very, very inappropriate.", "Choices sometimes come back to haunt you, and taking up with the self-destructive heretic Virendra to head off in the middle of an emergency for sex and games looks to be one of those decisions. His talking about it in public before Knights and commoners is probably what she deserves for being so inappropriate.", "Walking around naked during an earthquake tragedy is one thing, but having sex in Docktown and precarious buildings is quite another. What's she thinking making the love at a time like that? One has to wonder why she's Lady Aria's companion at all.", "I hear Virendra announced in a crowded Dunwasser Fieldway that he and miss Carolyn were heading off to the cathouse, tra-la-la. How improper! And also against the advice of staying in the safe zone during the earthquakes.", "Mister Thukal was said to have shown a complete lack of regard for both the state of the city, and the fact that there were murderers on the loose. He preferred to linger in Docktown over going somewhere safe, and showed a distinct lack of care for the safety of his house nobles.", "Guardswoman Breeze very dutifully risked her own safety to make sure that Docktown was evacuated during the earthquakes, keeping calm and level-headed. She proved to be a good leader during the crisis.", "Mister Jayland instantly obeyed the orders of the Constabulary to evacuate Docktown during the earthquakes, and even brought lumber to the camp in the field for use in creating shelter and protection.", "The new recruit to the Constabulary has acted professionally in every situation. He went so far as to travel down into Docktown at its most dangerous to assess the safety of the Bay and help evacuate people during the earthquakes. It's not too long before a man like that will be promoted!", "Mister Eiryk reportedly sent a scroll to Guardswoman Breeze sharing the latest news about evacuating the city due to the earthquakes and disclosing any scouting that had been done. It was good of him to make sure she was kept up to date on developments when she wasn't able to see and hear them for herself.", "Without thought for himself, Suavis is constantly serving in his capacity as a healer. He found vials and collected blood from donors for people during the earthquake without complaint or hesitation. He's said to always be ready and available to help those in need.", "Always willing to serve, Suavis entered Docktown, despite danger to himself, to retrieve vials for the collection of blood in payment to the sylphs. Despite it not being enough to withhold their elemental wrath, he sure did his part to attempt to save the city!", "Miss Senora generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Miss Stacy generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Zev generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Kegan generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Miss Zaria generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Thukal generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Jayland generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Eiryk generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Miss Adora generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Ford generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Ilo generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Cullan generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Kheldon generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Miss Polgara generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Fyros generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Tark generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Oushi generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Miss Dahlia generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Dylan generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Paladin Iare generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Rumor has it that Ilo ran to fetch the sword that was to be offered up to the air elementals, making quite an effort to be helpful during the event.", "Deputy Zaria was one of the only Constables willing to do her duty, staying behind to help people evacuate the city, even after knowing that a tidal wave was imminent.", "Word has it that miss Chen actually sacrificed herself to save Guardswoman Breeze during the tidal wave. What a trooper, and how surprising!", "Even after most others had left, Deputy Zaria returned to the city to help those still inside escape from the massive tidal wave that struck. Talk about being dutiful!", "Even after most others had left, Guardswoman Breeze returned to the city to help those still inside escape from the massive tidal wave that struck. Talk about being dutiful!", "Did you know that miss Izzy died trying to help save Dazrene from drowning? It's true! She even remained useful in death, serving as a floaty to keep Dazrene above water.", "Father Ramses, fearing for his own life and praying to the great S'allumer, reached for the people who were being pulled back by the water regardless of it compromising his own safety. If that's not a representative of the Light then don't know what is!", "Begrudingly someone told me that Guardswoman Breeze tried to save them from the tsunami. Something was mumbled about it being ridiculous how unselfish people are, but gratitude was shown nonetheless. Yay for heroes!", "Despite being severely weakened herself from the flood waters, Deputy Zaria went back for miss Elgin, stating she couldn't leave her behind. Idiotic heroics or a genuine care for preserving life? Who knows!", "Despite physical exhaustion making the task at hand difficult, miss Elgin took charge over Deputy Zaria and determinedly pulled her to safety ensuring she didn't succumb to the flood waters.", "The nerve of that Bekka! I hear she accused those involved in trying to save the city from the sylphs and water elementals heretical! What's heretical about wanting to work things out and possibly prevent a tidal wave? Grr .. grr ..", "Despite claiming that everyone who tried to appease the sylphs were heretical, miss Bekka wrote down a list of to-dos for the next few steps of the journey; how to aid the city, and how to keep everyone safe. Even if she doesn't know what she's talking about, she does try to be helpful.", "I hear miss Achlys risked her own life and health to fetch the corpse of Baron Edmond from within the flooded city walls of Triskellian. How brave!", "The Lady Theressa put on a huge display at the sight of Baron Edmond's corpse, blubbering and carrying on like nothing you've ever seen. While one can understand her grief, her overt behavior wasn't at all appropriate for a woman of her standing.", "Mister Eiryk has been helping to take care of refugees and is going above and beyond his duty as a worker for miss Bekka (though we don't really know what duties he actually has). I heard he even trained and was trying to get more capable people to assist with things more.", "Miss Stacy has been helping to heal people hurt by the tidal wave, learned more about healing, has taken care of refugees, and generally is undertaking more than her job and duty entails. They say she's a really nice minky ..", "Miss Una took it upon herself to find out who was doing what jobs at the farmhouse after the tidal wave and she appointed leaders in various areas in order to make things go more smoothly and effectively.", "I heard Chinco was bickering at the farmhouse with people, being completely unresponsive to anyone but Fyros when it came to helping out with what needed to be done. Why the loyalty to Fyros anyway?", "Diligent and stubborn, mister Kegan refuses to let even weariness hinder what he needs to do. In the absence of his superiors he took up responsibility of ensuring the safety and keeping law and order at the farm, despite being only a recruit in the Constabulary.", "Bekka worked tirelessly to assist the injured and newcomers at the farmhouse camp. She took care to provide food, water, and even a place to worship. Above and beyond that, she thought to make a list on which to write the names of missing and found people. What a wonderful birman!", "Bekka really took charge seeing that everyone was as comfortable as possible after the tidal wave. She made sure people had enough food, water, and even volunteered to act as a courier if needed. She also took initiative making up a list of survivors that showed up at the farmhouse so people could check for their loved ones.", "Word has it that when someone at the farm was grieving due to personal loss, miss Lidia scented herself with an alluring perfume and attempted to be flirtatious with the man despite the fact he was just hoping for a comforting presence. How inappropriate!", "When the city was at its worst, and people were being killed in quakes and floods, the Doloreaux promised to help the sylphs in order to attempt to stop the disasters. Not only did they not fulfill their promises, but they abandoned the task requested of them, and quit the city at Lord Samstag's orders without word of apology or any hint of the aid promised. Talk about poor leadership and great disappointment.", "Miss Bekka did amazing work during the crisis that hit the city, organizing people and making sure the evacuation of the town was as efficient as possible. Good for her!", "People are boggling over the nerve of Doctor Hush who reportedly stormed out of the barracks at the farmhouse and abandoned the Rinaldi Lieutenant Sunta who was dying of a fever right in front of everyone. What happened to that caring and kind healer we've heard so much about?", "Didja hear? Donatella knocked out some of Virendra's teeth for trying to ruin a wedding! Good for her setting him straight and giving him what he deserved for interfering with a happy day of matrimony. It might not have been the most polite way to handle it, but people seem to agree it was what needed to be done.", "I hear Lieutenant Sunta killed the leader of the drays at the farm and kept standing strong despite how badly she was hurt from the event.", "Mister Josef apparently approached Clover LePlow, getting grabby with his stuff, while he was trying to talk with a Noble about the refugees and city status. That's not just poor manners, it's asking to be hurt!", "Mister Clover may be unpolished, but when it comes to knowing his place under Rinaldi authority, he is more than willing to bow to direction. He's glad to lend his man to help check out the city, and agrees to do it under Rinaldi orders.", "Miss Achlys helped with the scouting of Triskellian to see if and when it would be safe to return to the city. Without people like her, it would be a guessing game!", "Despite the fact that mister Tark prefers cremation over burial, it wasn't the appropriate comment to make while transferring coffins into a wagon while the people hadn't had a chance to be revived.", "Miss Sable did a good job during the tidal wave crisis keeping track of people and things, and even arranging for dray meat to be jerked so it would last the refugees longer than it otherwise would.", "Mister Eiryk really knows how to use common sense. When the sylph gave a warning about an elemental creature that the city needed to deal with, he thought on options and how it might negatively effect the town by angering yet another magical being. Foresight in times of crisis is rather proper and welcome.", "Clover brought reports from his scouts to Lady Aria out of respect, deferred to her on the scouting by miss Achlys, brought additional information about the gates provided by one of his men and was actively supporting the city, but she consistently was intent on offering neither thanks nor respect for what had been done. Gratitude goes a long way!", "Where was Lord Twyrch when survivors were stuck and injured and unable to get away from the city, or when bandits started preying on small groups? Who knows, but suddenly he's ready to lead the way into the city when it seems safe to re-enter after the tidal wave. Talk about glory hunting..", "Instead of banding together with the rest of the city to help kill the beast that encroached upon their homes, Clover decided to utilize his time attempting to force the Rinaldi into supporting the return of mister Chinco's arms. Hardly a noble or honorable thing as would be expected of a gentryman; in fact, it's much more similar to the behavior of a Docktown thug.", "With much difficulty, mister Sang willingly lent out his bracelet to assist people with entering town through the waterway so that the gate could be opened within. Without it people might still be stuck out at that camp..", "During the siege of Triskellian to return to the city, Biggs was the only one who sought orders rather than causing mayhem by constantly shooting down anything anyone said.", "Mister Fyros really stayed in the middle of things during the octopus fight, seemingly putting his spear into the beast more than most others.", "Miss Zarie did a good job bandaging up Clover in the middle of the octopus fight. Her efforts should be commended.", "Whatever else you might say about Lady Aria, she isn't a coward. She was willing to put herself right into the thick of things to fight for the city, which isn't what you'd expect from a highborn lady.", "It was nice of Omen to give the head of the big dray that people were fighting to Sunta. Sunta did most of the damage and nearly died because of it, but Omen got in the last shot. She was generous to gift it as a show of respect.", "People seem to be noticing that Chinco's working on changing his ways. Apparently he's even being thoughtful, checking up on wounded House guards like Sunta (shock of shocks) to see if they need anything. If this keeps up he might even smile at a Constable someday. Yeah .. prolly not.", "It came as a surprise when Chinco popped in and asked a wounded Rinaldi guard if the needed anything. Certainly looks like his behavior is changing for the better!", "Guardswoman Breeze lets witnesses know they're meant to testify, but she doesn't let the suspects know that they also need to deliver a testimony. Intentional or not? I don't know, but the people seem to think it's the job of a Constable to make sure everyone knows everything.", "Despite Deputy Zaria requesting an increase in income several times to fit the job she was doing for the Constabulary, Sheriff Biggs ignored all her scrolls and inquiries and didn't even acknowledge that she wished to speak with him!", "Miss Achlys took to the sky and scouted the city, discovering a dangerous beast lurking within! She followed orders without hesitation and, despite her small stature, did a very big job. Nicely done!", "Lieutenant Sunta took on the dray pack leader with skill and bravery, protecting several others present from its vicious attacks. She was terrible wounded during the fighting and dealt great blows to the rampaging creature. Skill, grace, and ferocity -- that's Sunta!", "Miss Omen kept watch at the farm for stampeding drays, and even managed to kill a few during the first hunt of them. She's a lot tougher than she looks, they say, and is reportedly a sweetiepie to boot .. if you know how treat her right.", "Omen gave the trophy of the dray pack leader to Sunta, even though she landed the killing blow herself. She could have tried to selfishly keep it, but being the honorable type, she gave it up without any fuss at all. I say, good show!", "Physician Suavis saved Sunta's life! With mister Fyros as his assistant, he leapt into action rescuing the Lieutenant from the certain death that was surely awaiting her due to the beating she took from the dray pack leader.", "Sang was reportedly standing around in the commons calling the Don foolish, calling Lord Twyrch foolish, and indicating that both of their military knowledge is lesser than his own. What kind of a man calls the Don foolish, honestly?", "Despite a past of taking insult at the slightest comment an attacking others out of boredom, Chinco educated a newcomer of the city on who they could turn to for training in combative arts outside of himself.", "While some details are vague, confessing that she sometimes lets men see her breasts the first time they meet her is at the very least inappropriate.  Lets hope she meant in the bath house.", "Risking life and limb for the sake of a house member shows true dedication and loyalty. Aria went on the bandit expedition to haggle and came home a hero.", "That lioness is smooth and smart.  She stepped in when Aradhyl started publicly slandering another guild that would have hurt the Rinaldi.  Maybe she knows that cookies solve all disputes.", "Xena looked high and low for some friends. It's good to have her in your corner.", "Not even earthquakes can stop the generosity and heroics of Clover. He spent his own resources for the refugees in Dunwasser field and even initiated the search for missing people.", "Even though it was in the best of intentions Anne left the safety of newtown to check on house members. She took a long time and made people worry over her absence because she couldn't be bothered to send word of her safety.", "Used his bronze and his  brains to help with the reinforcements of the sewers after the earthquakes.  He personally helped rebuild a bridge and sent the carpenters to other locations.", "Elgin faced dangerous flood waters to try and save Caitriona.  Maybe Avoirdupois aren't afraid of scary water.", "She put her life on the line when she courageously came back to the flooded town to help people escape the water.", "For being a cat Zaria sure didn't mind jumping right in to try and save Caitriona from the perils of the flood water. Maybe her fur is water proof.", "With  the last of her strength and the help of some others Zaria  tried to rescue Elgin from the rushing flood water. Some call that bravery, others call it stupidity, either way lets hope they all made it out alive.", "Was a real trooper and heroic man when he made sure that his house members made it out of town after the flood waters became dangerous.", "Caitriona tried to save the last group of people leaving from the city when the flood waters were coming! When they hit and Izzy went under for a moment, she reached for her without hesitation! Thats a brave, Bisclavret raised wolfette for you!", "What's with the nurse, always asking people to run letters for her?", "During a tea party hosted by Doctor Hush and mister Fips, Virendra inquired if there was a tea around that could induce arousal. Hardly the most desirable topic of conversation for a polite and public event.", "People are raving about what a great hostess Doctor Hush is. They say she's the perfect picture of social etiquette, ensuring everyone is comfortable, engaged, and providing anybody who attends her events with refreshments.", "Can anyone ever say enough about Doctor Hush? Some people believe that she saved their lives, and note that she's given over expensive healing jars to keep death at bay while conducting surgery. There are your average healers, and then there are devoted healers like her.", "Though Doctor Hush was supposed to give a public speech, Fips stood up and took over, despite nerves, to cater to the waiting people.", "Pompous, arrogant, and rude are three of the words recently used to describe mister Edwardo. I heard that he demanded to be invited along on a dinner date between two courting people, and then insisted the gentleman he and the woman were with had to pay because he was their escort, even though his company was never wanted to begin with. Talk about unbecoming behavior for someone who claims to serve a Noble house.", "Doctor Hush generously co-hosted the Summer Garden Party with mister Fips, and held a talk on the medicinal uses of a variety of herbs. We should all be grateful that she shared her knowledge.", "Miss Rosaline helped mister Fips set up and run the Summer Garden Party, and also lent her prized plum tree for people to see and touch amidst the many other plants on show. How generous of her!", "Want to hear all about mister Fred and miss Natalie's sex life? Apparently you just have to mill about in the west commons and the information will be shared freely by the two, or so witnesses say.", "Miss Valora was kind enough to assist in clearing the rubble from the crack in the wall near the beach at Turret's End. Diligence and hard work are a good way to earn favor from your peers!", "Mister Sang was kind enough to assist in clearing the rubble from the crack in the wall near the beach at Turret's End. Diligence and hard work are a good way to earn favor from your peers!", "Miss Gemma was kind enough to assist in clearing the rubble from the crack in the wall near the beach at Turret's End. Diligence and hard work are a good way to earn favor from your peers!", "Miss Sable was kind enough to assist in clearing the rubble from the crack in the wall near the beach at Turret's End. Diligence and hard work are a good way to earn favor from your peers!", "Mister Virendra was kind enough to assist in clearing the rubble from the crack in the wall near the beach at Turret's End. Diligence and hard work are a good way to earn favor from your peers!", "The Constables are all excited that Deputy Zaria has caught up on the paperwork, sorted through all the old crime records, and has begun closing cases and getting everything in order. What a relief to finally have some organization.", "Even though she was just kidding around, Deputy Zaria asked Virendra to kneel down and be 'her chair'. After he did as she asked, she actually sat on his back! The people around who witnessed it found it be a very embarrassing situation, especially considering she represents the Constabulary.", "I hear Virendra paraded around the commons naked and was clearly heard making inappropriate suggestions to the women present. I know it's Docktown, but some behavior isn't even appropriate for the slums.", "It's said that miss Althea is playful to the point of displaying childish behavior, regardless of whom she's around. Most recently, she was seen acting this way in the presence of Constabulary members and Nobles of her own house in a public area. *tisk tisk*", "I heard that mister Kesari ran away and hid in his room when he was about to be arrested. Talk about cowardly and dishonorable behavior!", "Miss Aluine encouraged mister Seeley to give her a hug upon meeting him for the very first time. While consensual hugs in general are fine amongst friends, that kind of close and familiar behavior between strangers is inappropriate.", "Need a lesson in soldiering? You should look up miss Sable, who is currently training members of the Constabulary in the field. I don't know whether it's free or not, but it's good to know the education is out there.", "When the Constabulary confronted mister Kesari and stated he was to be arrested for his newest crimes, he had the sense to consent and go along without any resistance. Now there's a good chap.", "Mister Damien sure is a smart fellow. He himself sought out the Constabulary to deal with the fines he was charged to pay for disturbing the peace in his defense of a Noble. That's a good way to keep everyone happy and impressed!", "Out of all the registered militia, Captain Kaine was the only one to reply and be willing to aid with the capture of the serial killer Luciano.", "Intent on solving the labyrinth on Doctor Hush's blouse, Deputy Krell didn't realize that he was in fact staring at her bosom, which made a few people in the commons uncomfortable. Besides that, he's a Constable, and he should be setting the right example.", "Two months since Chesh turned himself into the Constabulary and Sheriff Biggs, as per his bond terms, and the Sheriff still hasn't arranged to give Clover back the coin he put up for Chesh's bond. That's a long time to wait for reimbursement.", "Though it was all in a bit of fun, it wasn't the most appropriate thing for miss Izzy to push herself beneath Nix's clothing and pretendingly manipulate his limbs in the commons.", "Acted quickly and decisively when Fyros was hurt and needed a doctor.  She also stuck by him afterwards to help take care of him. What are friends for I ask you?", "Allowing a woman to touch you is one thing. Letting a woman lift your shirt and caresses you intimately is another thing.  Nix should know better being a guard for the Avoirdupois.", "Whips are scary.  When someone is afraid of the whip you shouldn't purposefully scare them by cracking it near them.  Besides, wielding your weapon is a no no dontcha know.", "Lia went above and beyond the call of duty by not only educating a new healer but giving her own supplies to the new person.  Makes you wonder where the slave gets her supplies from that she can give them away so easily.", "Knew he would likely not be able to take down a mass murderer but he tried anyways. It's the thought that counts right?", "Did his duty and tried his best to take down a mass murderer. There is a proper man of the militia.", "Threatening a constable.  Tisk tisk. They are peace keepers you should know better than to vent to them even if you do have to take care of things yourself.", "Aided the constabulary guarding Ilo when he as threatened and by listening to rumours for info.  What a good citizen.", "Showing an inapproperiate picture of Virendra to the east commons, while funny, is just no something to codone.", "Trying to start a fight in the infirmary is not a thing you should do no matter who you are wanting to fight with.  You should not invoke violence when doctors are trying to heal people in a place of peace.  What's next fighting in the church?", "Worked hard to help the doctors while healing the deputies.  He dabbed blood and was eager to aid any way he was able.   He does know how to listen once in a while, go figure.", "Mister Ilo reportedly was ready and prompt when Doctor Hush needed an extra pair of hands with a patient. He is said to have dabbed away blood, and helped to cauterize a wound while remaining calm throughout the ordeal.", "That Virendra tried to start a fight in the infirmary where hurt people were trying to recuperate! Talk about the wrong place to spread chaos; the Doctors were very unappreciative.", "Eager to do her job, Doctor Hush worked tirelessly to cauterize, stitch, bandage, and medicate the Deputies and others in need during the chaotic capture of the mass murderer Luciano. If there's need of healing, she's the woman to turn to for sure!", "Despite having many opportunities and chances given to him by miss Bekka, Ilo is going around being excessively drunk and ungrateful to all of his friends and distantly related cousins. He should learn to show some appreciation.", "Mister Niven isn't perfect, but he's good enough to acknowledge and try to fix his mistakes. I hear when he messed up on miss Achlys' order, he sent her a free pestle as an apology to ensure she didn't have a negative view of his business.", "Miss Achlys has taken it upon herself to show Deputy Kegan some of the criminal hide-outs in Triskellian. If you're shady and were friends with her before, you might reconsider your relationship.", "Miss Zaria is being recognized around town for having a presence with the Constabulary while they're catching lots of flack from residents. People sincerely believe she's trying to better and more honest, both on a personal level and a professional level.", "Sir Matteo reportedly promised to donate a gun to Doctor Hush's charity auction, which was set up to make money for expanding the infirmary. He not only broke his promise to her, but he gave the gun away to someone else, and never even apologized! Talk about less than Noble behavior..", "Miss Sable has gone out of her way to take up studying healing techniques while helping others in town purchase fabric and teaching soldiering lessons to the Constabulary on the side, despite her membership in Clover's guild. She shows great talent and is progressing greatly as a person and productive citizen.", "Doctor Hush is a good and very patient teacher. She willingly donates her time to teach anybody who's interested in learning medical techniques or first aid, and her methods are both creative and engaging. If only all senior healers lived by her example.", "Mister Virendra got himself arrested again for provoking mister Ford and goring him reasonlessly when his attempts at goading didn't work. You'd think he'd eventually learn ..", "Mister Auron went and turned himself into the Constabulary for disturbing the peace in order to save his honor and get his punishment handled without any trouble. Wouldn't it be nice if all criminals walked in passively to the gaol?", "Miss Servita made a huge scene in the commons, making rude comments to the Constables and mister Kesari before running off when they announced they wanted to arrest her. Best to just take your licks and get it over with, lest you be punished in the Gaol and through word of mouth.", "Mister Biggs kept calm and patient as miss Servita caused a scene in the commons and proceeded to berate the Constables present. A lesser man might have flown off the handle, but not him!", "Doctor Hush held the charity auction, single-handedly collecting donations for the expansion of the infirmary. People recognize how much work that must have been!", "Doctor Hush organized a whole charity auction on her own! She was said to be a fantastic hostess the entire time, and even provided delicious refreshments for everyone to partake in and enjoy.", "It was nice of miss Dahlia to step up and help Doctor Hush with her charity auction when it was obvious the Doctor was having a hard time keeping up with the crowd. Woo for teamwork!", "Though Doctor Hush's silent auction didn't work from the get-go, she managed to adapt to the situation by turning it into a call-out auction for everyone to enjoy. Guests raved that the treats were lovely, the company was great, and they couldn't have asked for a better function.", "Captain Kaine reportedly showed a newcomer to the teahouse and purchased her a cup of tea to make her feel at home in the city. What a display of gentlemanly behavior from the Bisclavret.", "Deputy Zaria did her very best to maintain order and calm during the vampire attacks, which was no easy feat considering she was the only Deputy left who was able to fight.", "Miss Tomoe demonstrated her skills at healing and her powers of faith while trying to cure miss Sable and miss Sunta of their vampirism. Considering she arrived in the middle of the chaos, people believe she did an exemplary job.", "Mister Syrith assisted with moving mister Roofles into the chapel after he was bitten by a vampire. He then stayed in the chapel for an extended period of time to aid in watching over all of the wounded.", "Deputy Oushi put herself in harm's way to save miss Lia from being killed while she was attempting to retieve tainted blood from miss Sunta for study. The Deputy sustained severe injury due to her selfless act, but is strong and managed to pull through everything perfectly.", "Mister Chesh seems rather determined to sow seeds of conflict, even at the worst of times. He was making unwanted advances on miss Tomoe during the vampire crisis and began insulting the hard-working Deputies that were selflessly putting their lives on the line to protect people just like him.", "Lingeringly and closely, mister ford embraced mister Ilo in the commons. People find it be very odd behavior for a guard of the Rinaldi, especially when they know that guard was told by his superiors to not show  such affections in public.", "Miss Faira was being very suspicious in the marketplace - nibbling on mister Astu's neck, and acting excessively afraid of holy cats, holy water, and prayer beads. People assume she's up to nooo good!", "Mister Kheldon resigned from the Constabulary by sending his uniform into Zaria, instead of speaking to her face to face. Then, afterwards, he raises his complaints about the guild in a public forum. It was totally unprofessional and unnecessary.", "The slave Koz continues to dutifully clean the trash receptacles in the city without being asked to do so, despite the noticeable lack of enforcers around.", "Mister Auron kept miss Flora company and chatted with her while heated discussion took place all around. It was nice of him to offer the polite and much-needed distraction.", "Miss Althea is said to have rebuffed all attempts at polite conversation with Esquire Noe when there were no unreasonable inquiries made to begin with. One shouldn't be so rude to their superiors. It's a wonder she has such a high standing in her House's guard with manners like that.", "Goodness, could that girl wear any less? It's no wonder she married a slave and gave birth to a bastard child, poor soul.", "Miss Bekka apparently made several people feel unsafe in the infirmary when she began acting nonsensical, demanded to know every detail of what was occurring within, and unsheathed her dagger before waving it around.", "Whenever a horse needs saving, Doctor Hush is there! She kept calm in a stressful environment, when a cat was waving a weapon about wildly in the infirmary. Politely the good Doctor asked the cat to leave, and the level of the patient's safety was increased dramatically.", "Miss Aster is keeping up with all the paperwork and internal files in the Constabulary, reading what's new and what's happening in order to keep herself updated on any and all events. It's rare for someone to take so much initiative!", "Captain Kaine was insulting and disrespectful toward Captain Zev and others while they were attempting to deal with a vampire incident in the Turret Tavern. This was made further worse by the fact that both are Captains of house guards, and Kaine should have known better how to treat people properly, especially those of separate houses and equal rank as himself.", "A constable should behave in such a way to prompt peace.  Cursing at the courier for doing her job does not invoke peace nor does being too drunk to walk give the right impression of a constable.", "What kind of a person walks in, instantly assumes someone means harm to her drunken love, and then pushes them over? Apparently miss Lotis, who acted thusly to miss Achlys who was helping an inebriated Ilo by giving him some cool water. The hugs and caresses miss Lotis gave the weasel in a public area, straight after knocking down the healer, isn't what a Doctor would have ordered. Jealousy issues? Perhaps.", "Naught naughty.

Stopping the group so that he could demand that he could argue about respect and eventually challenge Lord Sabastien and Hanneman duel for a perceived insult, example isn t one. All it succeeded was causing delays and pushing back the groups arrival in the city. I don t think injuring the expedition leader and one of your own fighters is a very good tactic either.

Good weaselling!", "Though Fyros wasn't present for most of the trip to Chalon to deal with the Old Blood's Purge, he did employ his dagger in killing the jade landers within the warehouse, knocked out one of Gaston's (Old Blood's Purge leader after his father died) cronies with a special powder and then healed everyone afterwards. Good work!", "I'm not entirely sure what he was trying to do, but snooping around the Avoirdupois Archduke's castle isn't the best idea for someone representing a Paladin of the Church!

So do they not realize what an asset Sir Alvaro is for the house and what he has done? It is disgraceful to put such a well-respected and well-conducted man out in the cold.

His skill with his gun during the Noble Hunt was invaluable throughout, as he dispatched the majority of the animals that were found.", "Baroness Antonia is always the able and accommodating host. Preparations for the hunt are always made that much more easy when both people are able to plan and delegate effectively. Although she isn't much of a soldier, she remained calm in the face of danger, did her best, and knew when she was out of her depth and to stand aside rather than get injured. Instead she used her social skills to play perfectly the host and organizer of the trip to ensure everything ran smoothly.", "Esquire Noe, despite not being particularly martially trained, during the Noble Hunt threw herself into things like a seasoned professional.

As if he has a foot to stand on regarding misconduct .. heh.", "Even though it's not his job, Jardskjalfti took a personal interest in the murders Razeer and Samuel were accused of, and, despite not being literate, found someone to translate and came up with several solutions and answers to the conundrum.", "Chinco hasn't changed at all! Deputy Carrot asked him over to the gaol to discuss his crime against the church and he declined saying he would draw his sword against the Constable if he tried. It makes a Constable's job very hard. The Guild Council might want to look into reinstating his ban on carrying weapons!", "Generally speaking, making a deal with a member of the Constabulary where they gut themselves in some form of ritualistic suicide in order to speak without drawing a weapon about numerous convictions and law-breaking is frowned upon. But -- to then also stand there taunting shows very little class. For shame! Even he's better than that .. or so people thought.", "Despite his often questionable choices, Virendra was more than willing to aid the Constabulary in bringing in two very dangerous criminals and seeing justice served. He jumped into the fray and had the presence of mind to disarm Luciano when he was put out of action, and while the Sheriff and a Constable's attention was on Chinco. Well done.", "Mister Chesh instantly and unquestioningly sided with the Constabulary when it looked like they might need an extra hand tackling Chinco and Luciano. Maybe he has turned into a good guy?", "Together with Chesh, Virendra, and Deputy Carrot, the Sheriff stood up to Chinco and Luciano, who refused to answer for their crimes quietly. She lead from the front, and was engaged in combat until both yielded. Once they were defeated and disarmed, she had them both moved to the gaol where they were brought to justice for their crimes. Excellent work, Sheriff, the streets are a lot safer!", "Valiant Valdus jumped in front of a helpless girl during a terrible explosion! He took on all the flames for her -- ahh, what a gentleman.", "It's one thing to defend yourself when being attacked, but to go so far as to just outright kill those attacking you, especially when they don't have any martial experience, is just stooping too low. What happened to letting the law deal with matters? Who does Valdus think he is, being both judge and executioner?", "Father Antos stood up for the values of the church, questioning Deacon Ximen's need to hunt skinks and use their blood, despite the Deacon appearing very snappy, and his known reputation. He also was brave enough to speak up about Virendra being a Paladin Initiate in spite of his H-branded forehead. It takes guts to confront the daily leader of the Church -- especially someone like Ximen.", "Despite being told by the Sheriff not to pick the shadow crawler plant in the arena, Virendra went behind her back and very nearly manipulated Sang into retrieving it for him. When the Sheriff walked in on Sang trying to get the plant for Virendra, with no knowledge on what the plant actually did, Virendra stepped right into Zaria's face and blatantly mocked her by saying she used her title as Sheriff as armor, said he could do anything he wanted, and told her he had no respect for her anyway. Paladin Initiate? Not for long.", "Constable Drosnan doesn't do his job very well. When he brought in a criminal, he allowed the alleged party to remain fully suited in armor for the duration of his stay in the gaol. Smaaaart.", "Hunting skinks in the commons, and smearing the blood all over his face in the name of some church ritual? What has Deacon Ximen fallen to? He's even becoming agitated and upset over not being able to catch a skink. I think Ximen has forgotten his dignity and how to behave properly.", "Did you hear what Zaria did in West Triskellian? It was amazing! She chased down, mounted, and captured a frickin' armored higg'n dray! These things are huuge, easily big enough to bowl over a group of people, and she was all like 'Grrrr .. yous mine now.' Oh yeah, she also returned some items to a crazy old man, and lead troops into battle with mister Hanneman.", "I hear Presbyter Ximen is always looking for information pertaining to the church or heretics. The more useful the information is, the more handsomely he pays. It might not be such a bad idea to sell that one person out, hm?", "Mister Hanneman took over command of the troops from the wildly inexperienced miss Zanthia who was tasked with heading the trip as Reeve of the Rinaldi. His tactics and management made the fight a breeze and ultimately meant that fewer people got injured.", "I'm not quite sure Virendra is right in the head. In what world does a sane person conceive of the idea that setting his hands on fire with whiskey in order to fight a spider is smart?! The spider caught fire, sure, but then the Sheriff and others were put in unnecessary danger. It's not exactly what you need from people that are supposed to be looking out for you.", "Mister Hanneman was invaluable during the siege on West Triskellian and the invading Jadelanders. He helped solve the puzzles at the old tiger's crooked house, scouted out much-needed information, and directed troops efficiently against the magic and numbers of the foreign enemies so that losses were minimal despite the lack of healers. Fantastic!", "Despite having little knowledge on war, miss Zanthia showed courage in representing the Rinaldi on the battlefield, and even pretended to be a Rinaldi prisoner so that the faux 'mercenary' company could enter West Triskellian initially. It didn't work, but her bravery was noted nonetheless.", "During the trip to West Triskellian, and before the army could annihilate the enemy Jadelanders, Virendra's gobby mouth and reckless moves got him killed. Did he really think setting his hands alight to fight a spider was useful? He nearly killed the Sheriff.", "As useful, and possibly funny, as it was at the time, Jasper really shouldn't have disrespected a corpse by throwing it at the oncoming Jadelanders to defend blows. At least he came out unharmed from that particular maneuver.", "He might be a gender-confused hyena, but it's not really something everyone needs to know, particularly before an impending siege upon the Jadelanders invading West Triskellian. At least Logan entertained the wolf Virendra before he died. Keeping his attention away from petty bickering was handy.", "Sir Twyrch was kind enough to lend Lord Valentinus one of his blades, having learned that he was without one until it arrives via courier.", "When the fisherwife wanted to hunt down her husband for spending all the wages he earned on whiskey, mister Jardskjalfti didn't give up the drunkard husband, but paid from his own pockets to ensure the wife and the five kids had enough money to live off.", "Even though the memorial service for Tamara was short notice, Lady Antonia still made a point to show. She had never even met the Baroness, so it was especially touching that she would go out of her way to show her support.", "Rufius met Tomoe and Valdus, asking for their aid in recovering the stolen silverware from the palace. Valdus was quite rude -- he couldn't show basic courtesy and just nuzzled against Tomoe and acted very uncaring. When Tomoe said she would keep an eye out, Valdus directly said he would not and used an excuse of being tired as to why. The man really need to learn proper manners and basic courtesy, and at the very least, be polite and apologize for poor behavior.", "Sir Bayard is rather presumptuous, thinking he knows the reasons why the Rinaldi are supporting Dame Xena overseeing the Sailors Guild. Not only this, which is a mistake all people can make, he threatens to take the law into his own hands if his delusions become true, ignoring the Constabulary, the law, and Rinaldi rule. To conclude the matter, he even questions Dame Xena's honor, a well-loved and well-respected Knight of the Rinaldi. Someone really needs to learn diplomacy if they're going to toss around insults and threats.", "Sir Bayard wrote a rather abrasive letter to Xena threatening the life of Alessa should she cross him, stating clearly that he wouldn't involve the law -- only his blade. He was also presumptuous in Xena's association making unsubtle assumptions that Xena's intentions were dishonorable. He should show more respect for Rinaldi law and Rinaldi Knights.", "Miss Soto aided Silver Butler Rufius greatly when she searched and found no less than ten missing silverware pieces and promptly returned them. Her name is praised amongst the Palace staff as a dedicated and trustworthy person in Docktown.", "Mister Adon aided Silver Butler Rufius more than could be expected when he searched and found six of the missive silverware pieces. He spent days trying to locate the silver, and several times sent in what he had found. His name is praised amongst the Palace staff as a dedicated and trustworthy servant to the Rinaldi.", "As a completely new citizen in Triskellian, mister Castle showed extraordinary loyalty to his new home by aiding Silver Butler Rufius in retrieving the lost silverware. Without much knowledge of the city, he took the time to search and found five of the missing items. As the law abiding person he is, he promptly returned his findings. Mister Castle's name is praised among the palace staff as a dedicated and trustworthy servant to the Rinaldi.", "In spite of his nature, mister Ilo decided to send in the silverware he found -- 8 pieces in all, worth quite a fortune. He is to be commended for going against his nature and following the path of honesty.", " Dame Xena showed exceptional bravery when she spoke up as the first person in the trail against Presbyter Ximen, thereby risking standing alone and unsupported in the accusations against the Inquisition and  risking becoming a target for them herself. A true knight with a brave heart, the Rinaldi can be proud of her.", " All right, all right, never mind that Dame Xena was eating skinks but her table manners when she was doing so! Disgusting!", "Despite personal disagreements and Dame Xena petitioning to get him  demoted within the Church, Deacon Ximen willingly volunteered to go on an  expedition to Paludestris to retrieve some enchanted scissors with which Dame Xena  could be freed from my curse of silence. He could have easily turned her away due to their history, but instead he showed mercy and kindness in a  time when she  most desperately needed it. I'm starting to believe there's much more humanity in him than people give him credit for.", "Good of Dame Xena to have the sense to give up her weapons when she knows her soul is in the clutches of an evil Necromancer.", "After Xena was cleansed of black magic, she was openly angry at Marcus for his desire to keep those tainted with black magic contained so they would not pose a threat to the city or be accused for murders that they may or may not have been involved in. Where's the love???", "Dame Xena aided in Lord Marcus's search for his wife Tamara and recovering her remains, and was a source of comfort for him. She's so loyal.", "Lord Marcus continued the search for his wife, even years after her disappearance so that he, his daughter, and the House could get some.", "Lady Antonia kept the house organized and as safe as possible when Dame Xena and Adon were taken by black magic curse and she had to real way of helping. She delegated takss, kept up on correspondences, consistently visited them in the infirmary to ensure they were being well taken care of, and continued to ensure the day to day business ran smoothly. Despite feeling she had failed in some way, she truly had more success during that trying time than she realizes.", "Sir Twyrch took it upon himself to lead a small group of Rinaldi to the arena and school them in various combat topics free of charge. He was good-natured about the entire ordeal, even lending a weapon to Lord Valentinus with which to spar.", " While sparring with a mixed group of people in the Docktown arena, he continuously made inappropriate remarks to Reeve Zanthia about how she could/should kiss him, how he enjoyed her touch when she was attempting to bandage him, etc. A new Noble to town should be more careful about what he says in public places and who he says it in front of, lest he reflect poorly upon his House and seem less than virtuous.", "After hearing about the black magic curse that afflicted her house members, she automatically took to finding a scholar-mage who could further investigate the true meaning behind what occurred to ensure the safety and reputation of the Rinaldi and their royalty. Truly, her mind is an astounding machine that looks at every angle of a situation and can easily come up with appropriate solutions. She is an undeniable asset to the embassy.", "Lord Matteo asked for a dusky lesson right in the middle of the commons. I know it's not that rare of a language to know anymore, but it's reserved typically for criminal sorts. You don't, as a noble, request that sort of information in the middle of a crowded place.", "Lord Matteo made a scene in the tea house because the Ambassador of the Rinaldi didn't permit him to suit Lady Grazia. He insulted his fellow Knight, Dame Xena, by stating she lacked discretion and that it was partially her fault he couldn't be with Grazia because she supposedly is accepting suitors, and then followingly insulted the Rinaldi Reeve, stating he was a snitch who would repeat any private conversations to his superior -- which he very well should, as it follows protocol. His demeanor is unbecoming his station, and his words are dangerously.", "Dame Xena did show extra-ordinary dedication when Silver Butler Rufius announced the missing silverware. Not only did the Dame spend her own personal time looking for lost items, she also utilized her resources to discover where the missing items were hidden, discovering that a citizen of Triskellian had kept several pieces for himself.", "Mister Fyros put himself in harm's way to lead a group into the sewers to deal with the spider infestation -- nearly losing his life in the process.", "Mister Rylen traveled along with the group heading into the sewers, unarmed no less, to assist in flooding out the mutant spiders into the bay. Brave or stupid .. I don't know, but someone apparently was impressed.", "Did you see that message the Sheriff wrote about the spiders? The one where the Sergeant was asking people not to go down into the sewers? Looks like she rather undermined him there -- I hope that people still get the message.", "Now while it may be all well and good Xena going down to the sewers, it's still a bit reckless of her, isn't it? That place was crawling with spiders and she took civilians. Not to mention possibly blundering through the work that other people had been doing down there.", "Biggs chided Xena for assisting a party of citizens down in the sewers to remove the spiders. He accused her of being the leader and initiator, which she wasn't, and then informed her he was disappointed in her for not writing to him first and letting him know what she was doing. Since when does a Noble have to report their activities to the Constabulary when the matter at hand isn't a legal one? And, furthermore, why is it now an insult to try and make the city a safer place and keep people (who might be too inexperienced for the task they're undertaking) out of harm's way? Someone needs to get their head out of their hiney.", "Dame Xena bravely took control of the sewers and helped arrange for them to be flooded to wash away the dangerous spiders. Just like a knight, to watch out for the common people, the defenseless and the weak.  Its what a Knight -should- be.", "Xena had the balls to not only speak the launguage of the street rats in the commons but also took it upon herself to teach others the bad habit too. Why would a knight show off such a skill?", " Asking for a slumhoodery lesson from another Noble in the middle of the commons. Really? At least Lady Anelie could have done it in private so as not to be somewhat insulting.", "Imagine a perfectly pleasant, lovely field. Flowers growing, bees a'buzzing, tranquil, and idyllic. Now imagine it ruined by that bat girl Achlys brawling all over it! Grrr .. there are arenas for just that sort of thing!", "Imagine a perfectly pleasant, lovely field. Flowers growing, bees a'buzzing, tranquil, and idyllic. Now imagine it ruined by that shrew Alfio brawling all over it! Grrr .. there are arenas for just that sort of thing!", "For a smart fellah, people are sayin' mister Iain is rather dumb. He was said to be standin' right in the commons insultin' every workin' man's way of life, as well as the tactics the Constables use to control criminals. He was heard sayin' we have a lamentable lack of specialization apart from boorish force. I'm not sure what that all means, but it sounds like he's callin' us all stupid. What's stupid is standin' in the middle of Docktown and sayin' so! He's liable to find some boorish force comin' at his nose if he ain't careful!", "As a director it's considered very bad practice to cut actors from a play and then not tell them. That's what Nan did, and left the poor chap to only find out when the show went up. Poor form!", "Even though Braxton is the son of both Lord Twyrch and Baroness Kenina, he has been seen entering the tailor shop filching on the clothing in the racks reserved for the poor and new. You'd think he was well provided for!", "The arrogance of some people! That Sang, especially. I hear he decided it was his right to break up a picnic and ruin several people's afternoons simply because they decided to have a friendly sparring match while enjoying their time in the meadow. He just walked right in like he owned the place, throwing objects and insults, demanding that everyone stop and concede to his always delusional whims. Just because he's some University so-and-so doesn't mean he's better than anyone else. Someone should tell him that! Oh wait .. I'm telling him that.", "It seems Lord Twyrch has done a wonderful job raising his son, Braxton, and that the boy is eager to follow in his father's diplomatic footsteps. Prelate Theressa called upon young Braxton to discuss concerns over the behavior of some of the Bisclavret craftsmen. She was very pleased with his handling of the situation, calling him prompt, efficient, diplomatic, and graceful.", "That boar Knight Sir Erwin doesn't know much about gratitude. A fellow boar tried to get him to go along to help out a failing village and he simply turned it down.", "Miss Aneira did a wonderful job in hosting the dinner party, and she made the Bisclavret house very proud.", "Whilst in the commons, mister Cullan was overheard forcing his opinion on a reluctant mister Giles on what is and isn't appropriate in terms of service to the Constabulary. He was speaking as a member of the militia, whose sole purpose is to take up arms against criminals, but that's not entirely what the Constabulary is about. As Giles was sticking up for himself, Cullan also decided to chide miss Odessa on waving about a naked blade despite that he was hypocritically carrying an exposed rapier himself. Get your facts straight, wolfie!", "I heard that Cullan was repeatedly insulting during a conversation he was having with mister Giles about the Constabulary, and when he was informed of this and requested to apologize, he proceeded instead to repeat the insult twice more, and threaten him! Either he's too stupid to follow a simple conversation, too arrogant to admit his mistakes, or he's an abusive brute.", "Lady Georgianna ran a small social and did so with grace, despite that someone faceplanted into a pie.", "Lady Georgianna wasted no time arranging a social upon her return to town. The turn out was great and the company enjoyable for such little planning.", "Mister Chinco kindly offered fresh, hand-picked strawberries to everyone in the commons. What a breath of fresh air!", "Fyros was rumored to be busily running in and out of the commons, rudely throwing scrolls at the poor, overworked courier, all while blatantly ignoring everyone else present even though he was greeted several times. Apparently busy mercenaries have no time to return pleasantries, and likely they're trained in poor manners. What a horrible trade skill.", "That bat, Achlys, sure can keep a cool head. She even managed to patch up Deacon Ximen -while- he was burning a heretic! Talk about skill .. woh.", "Don't make any arrangements with Doctor Hush. She takes loyal friends and discards them when they are no longer useful to her. She'll make vows and arrangements for instruction and payments, for willing service, and totally pretend they never happened and threaten to blacklist them for inquiring about the status of said arrangements. Next, she might send them a scroll, saying she doesn't even want any correspondence to discuss the situation like civilized people would, but will instead make threats via the courier that one simple query is cause for a blacklisting. Can a person become more hostile or arrogant and totally dismiss all discussion and arrangements previously agreed upon?", "That arrogant young Braxton started a scene with a loyal Bisclavret guardsman about nothing. Seems mister Viktor and young Pepper have known each other for years, and are basically siblings, but that didn't stop Braxton from berating him and insulting his honor, accusing him of gross misconduct and bringing shame to the House. He drummed Viktor right out of a job, right then and there! Little Pepper was only sitting on his shoulders, like she always does! I don't know if being the son of a Noble gives that entitled twerp authority over all of House Bisclavret, but he sure seems to think it does.", "People might not generally care, but Hush was in public, in the west commons, referring to people as twats in the crowd. Even though it's amusing, it's not very appropriate for a gentry member, is it?", "Did you hear that? Apparently Fyros lied straight to Achlys' face saying Hush said he was allowed to learn medic from her despite being outside the University guild. When Lys checked up with her boss this was in fact not true at all. Then he cussed Hush in the middle of the commons for calling him out! What a twat!", "Mister Fyros openly spoke out against Doctor Hush, a woman of rank that is held in high regard by most, if not all, of the city, and in the commons! He called her all sorts of horrid names and it was really mean and hateful. For shame, mister Fulke, for shame!", "Miss Nan took the time to not only write and direct a wonderful play for the city, but she included a valuable lesson in the script itself -- that every action has a consequence. In this case, we learned the valuable lesson that taking grains impairs one's judgement - sometimes fatally.", "Miss Nan wrote and organized a play which turned out to be a big success. You have to admire the dedication and hard work such an endeavor requires.", "When telling newcomers about his guild, mister Chesh freely advertises that he doesn't care whether the jobs he gets hired to do are legal or not, he's just happy to do them. For an indentured servant, he isn't very smart, is he?", "Lady Georgianna held a social get-together which everyone was invited to. There were fresh strawberries, drinks, chocolate, pie, and good company. She went out of her way to arrange for something to happen during a time when hardly anything has been happening at all. Even the room was decked out in pretty streamers, with everything in its place and a place for everything! She should be commended for attempting to provide regular socials that anyone can come and enjoy.", "Good on Nan for writing her own play, and what dedication too for finally managing to present it in the theatre form after three whole years of trying, waiting, and disappointment. She paid for all of the equipment, including furniture, clothing, and stage props. Congratulations for all your hard work paying off.", "Alfio volunteered to take part in Nan's play as the creepy, feminine spider. Despite his difficult and apparent inability to portray a female effectively, it all worked out to give the play a humorous edge. Well done!", "As one accustomed to being proper at all times, mister Kaine managed to let loose a little and dress up as a crate slash dewdrop slash Constable for Nan's play. He may have accidentally turned toward the exit whilst blinded beneath the box, but it all added to the light-heartedness of the theatre. Good work!", "Alma managed to conquer her stutter so that she could play a lead role in Nan's play, which shows just how much work she was willing to put towards a good and fun cause!", "Usually shy, Rylen did fantastic playing a feminine flower in Nan's play, Pink! He was a good sport wearing a dress which couldn't have been more fluttery and girlish if it tried.. Personally, I don't think I could have let loose as many tears on the stage in front of so many people if I tried! Good going, skunk boy.", "Looks like the Bisclavret Lady is slumming it in the commons yet again. Not only that, but with LePlow of all people. They've been spending quite a bit of time behind closed doors together.", "Kaine has served the Bisclavret with every breath in his body. Even when Lord Twyrch and his posse of fools came along and forced Kaine to take the position of Reeve, he handled it with nothing but grace and respect.", "Ambassador Kaine has handled the current change in power within the Bisclavret very well and has continued to represent his House with honor and integrity while those around squander their chance at making the House better. Good on him for being such a good sport and allowing those less capable a chance to try their hand at running things.", "Mister Adon got Baron Marcus' sister out of a foreign house before it blew up and to safety. He followed orders intelligently and without delay and did a good job. He's a handy fellow to have as your friend!", "Mister Adon silenced the man calling for Xena's death below deck when her ship was in a violent storm and he believed it was bad luck due to her being a woman. Adon opened his throat as a warning to other mutinous crew, and it worked beautifully. Murder isn't always the best option, especially without the Captain's permission, but treason and mutiny only have one sentence, and Adon wasn't shy in carrying it out.", "Without any provocation, Chesh instigated an argument between himself and Una, with Chinco supporting him in an attempt to gang up by bringing up the case against Sir Bayard for requesting someone bow to him in Newtown. Chesh called Una an 'ass kisser of Nobles' for siding with Sir Bayard on what is and isn't expected in Newtown, picking on her while she was conveniently present. When it came to apologizing to her as a serf, Chesh accused her of ass kissing again, only without the use of curse words, which didn't retract the insult whatsoever. Shame, shame.", "The good Doctor Rose was quite insistent about talking with Lady Georgianna about a private medical procedure in the middle of the Docktown commons, despite the Lady's request to discuss it at a later time. The Doctor even attempted to pressure her into getting the aforementioned procedure done, amidst the many inquisitive glances of the people loitering nearby.

Is she completely oblivious to the fact that he is a Lutaran?", "Gabrielle is hinting at using her newspaper as a weapon against the entire Great House of Bisclavret, after she was insulted by the Captain of the Guard, mister Cullan. Why not follow the socially acceptable course of action and request an honorable duel to defend the honor of the Avoirdupois? Where is her fiance in this to defend her personal honor?

You wouldn't catch me touching most of the heads in Triskellian, that's for sure.", "So that Virendra, I think he's with the Sailor's guild, he's all about giving out free lessons in handling pain after he whacks people good in a spar.  Or elsewhere, depending who you ask.  I wonder how he goes about it... probably involves some things that are better left in private.", "Brooks'll tell ya, if you're at an event with peers, knights and gentry... even if you're a commoner, you don't dance cheek to cheek!  Nevernevernever!", "So I've been talking about being charitable a lot, haven't I?  Well Sir Althalus is downright charitable.  But it comes with a price.  Yon poor beggars in the streets and alleys might get a bit of coin off of him, sure, but you gotta listen to him go on and on and on about the Light and being concerned about the souls of other.  Crikey mate, they just need a hot meal, not a lecture.  But I'll admit, he's a good sort for bothering to give at all.", "The recent Single's Ball, lots of chatter about that.  I hear tell that it was originally the idea of Lord Marcus and Viscountess Kenina.  But they were just too lazy to figure everything out.  So they got Aysun to do it!  Good thing to, because she did a bang up job and is so modest about her role in the whole thing.  Gentry, who'd a thunk it?", "Senora is, I hear, one of the most senior Doloreaux commoners.  Served since forever and really loyal too.  And it's no wonder, she goes around hugging the boars like they're her best gal pals!  I don't know about you, but that's not something I'd expect to see out of a serious reeve-clerk-high up- position thingy like her.", "That Lucinda!  You haven't heard?  Apparently she's walk right up and lay one on whoever is standing around in the commons.  Depending on who you ask.  I know a few blokes who wouldn't mind meeting a gal like her.", "That Cork!  You haven't heard?  Apparently he'll walk right up and lay one on whoever is standing around in the commons.  Depending on who you ask.  I know a few gals who wouldn't mind meeting a bloke like him.", "Cork's a dirty, mongrel, yuck yuck yucky sort of guy.  But he carries S'allumer in his heart and wishes people the Light's blessing.  So I guess that counts for something.", "Geradan's really trying to get himself right in the eyes of the church.  But he still swore at service!  Right there in front of the Light and everyone!", "So I was talking to one of my chums the other day, and he was telling me about this gal Polgara.  I don't know if she's married to this bloke or anything, but she went right into a room of the boarding house with a man fitting Khagra's description!  And to top it all off, she was dressed like she was going to whip him!  Leather head-to-toe, hand to the Light!  Of course if he is her husband, ignore whatever I'm saying.", "You know Red?  Or Rhea?  Yeah, that's the one.  I done heard that she was jawing in the commons about finding a pretty girl for some fella.  Right there in front of everybody!  If you ask me, she should stick to keeping her thoughts to herself.", "Jarek's a downright fool if you ask me!  He's too open about his trying to woo women, never you mind the fact that he inspects them in a closer than proper way.  And I'm not just talking about their faces and personalities!", "That Chinco.  What a hoot.  Apparently he got sprayed by a skunk named Cork, completely by accident!  But that didn't stop Chinco by gum, he turned right around broke that bloke's nose.  It's the most I'd seen him say or do in... well, since the last time he hurt someone!", "Heard about Kolgrim?  Didn't think so.  I thought that he was a right respectable sort of scholar type.  But turns out, he's nothing but a scoundrel.  Drunkenly staggering around town, he openly told his current love interest, in public no less, that he cheats on her.  For shame!  How low can a man be to treat a poor woman like that?", "Bishop Basanti always gives the most lovely sermons.  But at her last one she mentioned to a crowd of nobles, gentry and commoners that she spends her days laying around in her pajamas eating cake!  That's not what you'd expect from someone preaching the Light's lessons, is it?  For shame!", "There's this gal who comes around every now and again by the name of Celia.  According to my best friend's doctor's barber's midwife's carpenter, she went ahead and slapped Virendra when he touched her behind!  That girl has spunk!", "Oh the antics of Docktown!  Listen to this here: Virendra went ahead and touched Celia's derriere, so she slapped him right across the face!  The catch?  He slapped her right back!  The nerve!  One of the constables was going to file charges against them both for minor assault until Sir Althalus stepped in.  He demanded that Virendra apologize, which he did.  A happy ending all around, wouldn't you say?  That Althalus has a good head on his shoulders.", "Lianaar's a kind and generous soul... depending on who you ask.  A new gentry woman had arrived in Triskellian and Lianaar offered to pay for clothing for the gentry out of her own pocket.  In a very discreet way as to not make the new miss seem embarrassed.  It's the sort of thing to make you think there's still hope that the Light's lessons are being taking ot heart.", "I heard some girls gossiping over at the Turret today, and they say that if you ask anyone, Sir Bayard is a true gentleman who carries himself just as a knight should. Polite, generous and helpful, he is an exemplar of chivalry and good decorum.", "That Senora certainly knows how to welcome new members of her House to Triskellian.  That is how you make a House grow.", "Bruno's a busy sort of guy, no doubt, and everyone is clambering for his attention.  I guess scrolls are too hard to write these days.  Anyway, he was talking to a client in the commons the other day and someone just kept interrupting him.  Wouldn't shut their mouth for love nor money.  But old Bruno, he suggested a new conversation should be continued only after his current discussion was complete.  Put them in their place, Bruno.", "I'm sure everyone knows just how big Virendra's mouth is.  It's no secret.  But when you go around interrupting the conversations of simple craftsmen, and I mean simple, it's bound to confuse the poor guy.  While the enthusiasm is flattering it's still rude.  Where have manners gone?  Out the window, that's where!", "I hear that Jahren, good man that he is or appears to be, has a tendency of first making sure he lands safely in a good place, before jumping from his current position.  But he always fails to ask about release from oaths.  It's no wonder bridges are burnt and some people consider him unreliable.  Oath breakers are not to be trusted.", "Not only did Jahren come uninvited to the single's social, but he brought the wife of someone else with him as company.  What a scandal!  Who brings a married woman to an event for singles?!  Seriously?!  I have no idea!", "You want to hear a dirty little secret?  I knew you did, come closer.  Apparently Jahren engages in blasphemous romantic adventures.  The biggest scandal being word getting around about it.  I always say, if you can't trust them, don't lay with them.  But that's just me.", "Instead of being understanding and explaining the right and wrongs of behavior in Triskellian, I heard that Hush snapped quite viciously at a newcomer who did not yet understand the rules of a big city.  Honestly?  Where is the understanding?", "I know I've said lots of bad things about that slave, Ryan.  Yeah he probably needs to be shot, stabbed or hung.  But when it comes to newcomers, he's pretty understanding.  Especially when commoners aren't.  Have the commoners' minds rotted with a feeling of superiority?  Don't they remember that we all started somewhere?  For shame, commoners, for shame.", "My mammy always told me, if there's a preacher preaching, you'd better look like you ain't sleeping.  Or else your soul will be condemned to the fiery pits of wherever.  But Edd, bless his heart, he doesn't mind taking a nap in the pews.  I hope Ximen doesn't catch him next time.", "I've got another funny about Eddy.  Apparently he was at service in the chapel, and he made some lewd comments.  Boy what I would give to be able to see the look on the ladies' faces.", "Not only does Eddy make lewd comments during sermons, but they're just raunchy enough to make women blush.  Outrageous!  Or stupendous, depending on your point of view.", "I feel for the Sheriff, I do.  It's hard to find good men to serve him.  But it doesn't excuse his man Loki from ignoring all forms of social etiquette and insulting men of good birth everywhere.  I have it on good authority that the dog in question said, \\"I won't bow down to you due to your good breeding, nor give in to your petty demands.\\"  Tisk tisk.  Not something someone should be saying to a member of the gentry.", "Aeryn is someone who is sensitive to decorum and privacy.  Why I hear tell that she led a group of people away from another group of people, so they could speak privately on a sensitive issue.  How polite and helpful.", "That Meepers!  Another helpful seamstress of the city!  Giving free garments to those who are in need.  Her heart overflows with kindness!", "Sergeant Danae is a longstanding member of the Constabulary.  But y'know... there's something about a constable who has been charged for assault that makes me think she might not be the right person for the job.  But you didn't hear that from me, I don't want her knocking down my door and beating me too.", "That Rhea.  She's a hotheaded woman.  Apparently she doesn't care what she says to who, insulting higher ranking people than herself right to their faces!  Oh the shame of it all.", "Apparently Noire's a stand up kind of girl.  Defending Cerridwyn when she was in need.  Don't ask me how or why, I just repeat what I'm told.  Maybe she'll smarten up enough to get rid of that purple fur.  Eyuck!", "I like Hush, I really do.  She gave my uncle some nasty syrup to clear up his sinuses.  But honestly.  Gossiping about nobles and Cerridwyn with the likes of Rhea?  She should really know better than that.", "That Rhea, always spouting off when she shouldn't.  I hear tell she was insulting Cerridwyn in the commons, making fun of her by saying she's a \\"lord of a bunch of commoners\\" and generally taunting her in a nasty tone, all because the gentry might have suggested that maybe her clothes weren't exactly proper.", "What is there to say about Cullan?  Well he's a high-ranking commoner with the Bisclavret.  But that won't stop him from ignoring all propriety and leaping to the defense of a vulgar fox like Rhea!  And not only that, but he didn't try to quell her tongue, he egged her on!  Encouraging her to harass a member of the gentry even more!  Not what one would expect from a squire.  Not at all.", "All I see Jahren do is run off to private rooms with women. Specifically, Vajhira, and as far as I know she's courting another man. He seems to be doing that a lot lately, and I think it's a little soon after getting out of a relationship, not to mention his antics at the social.", "I heard that Tomoe was going to join the church when she came to Triskellian.  Instead she laid with a random man not seven days after she'd arrived.  Maybe it's better that she isn't tending to S'allumer's flock.", "Danae.  What is there to say?  I should hope that not all constables has such thin skin that they would fly into a rage and bea- their friends over a simple misunderstanding and hurt feelings. The mere idea that an individual like that would be allowed within the Constabulary is absolutely disgusting and.", "Apparently Cullan likes to suggest to women that she aught chase off the other 'horses'.  Which strikes me as odd and silly.  You'd think that an established commoner and a squire wouldn't make that kind of suggestion.  Or something.  For shame!", "That slave Ryan.  I know a lot of people don't have anything good to say about him, but I hear that he risked his life and nearly died to defend his owner, who was being attacked over an argument.  Now if that is not a good slave, I don't know what is.", "So apparently a man named Dodger actually tried to pickpocket Sir Althalus.  It was even after the knight asked him for a favor and gave him two denarii to do it!  Or so they tell me.", "A man named Chesh apparently spit in three faces that we know of, including Katrina's!  And he punched a girl in the stomach!  Oh Light!  What will we do?!", "So this gal named Fergie was seen just wandering around wearing wings!  In public!  Can you believe that?  The last person with wings was Dio, and we all know how that ended.", "Apparently Tomoe has a strong will and lots of forgiveness.  Huzzah and such.", "That Ryan!  Apparently Noe was sick with something awful and he went above and beyond while taking care of her.  That's a good slave, someone get him a treat.", "Apparently Thukal's a good guy for helping Noe while she was sick.  Yay for good guys!", "Virendra!  Will it never end?!  He was soooooo disrespectful to a ranking member of the Avoirdupois House.  Just like always!  Someone should hurt him badly to teach him a lesson.", "So apparently, if what my brother said is true, Virendra insulted Noe by implying that she was a lazy good-for-nothing with a sore arse from sitting around.  Maybe there's a little nugget of truth in there, but shock and horror that he would actually say so to her!", "I heard that Ayra walked into the lounge of the boarding house with naught a scrap of cloth covering her body.  Some people are very oblivious.", "I heard through the grapevine that Izzy is shacking up with Jahren.  And they aren't even married!  You'd think she would have learned her lesson, since last time he slept with her he left her for another woman.", "So my mate was standing in the commons the other day listening to people chattering.  He tells me that Rhea and Jarek were up to no good.  She goaded him onto stabbing a newcomer with the promise of showing Jarek her 'num-nums', whatever those are.  And he did it.  Can you believe that?", "That Jarek's turning into wild beast!  Apparently he ran right up to someone and stabbed him for no reason whatsoever!", "Apparently Rhea has taken to defending the Avoirdupois for some reason.  Defend them from what?  I don't know.  But it sure seemed important when people were gossiping around the putrid well.", "Mufasa's a dirty boy!  Apparently he was seen entering the PRIVATE quarters of a MARRIED woman wearing a scandalously skimpy loincloth.  Is there no such thing as propriety in this day and age?", "In other scandalous gossip, Lidia was seen leading a scantily-clad man into her private chambers.  To \\"fit an armband.\\"  I'm sure that's not the only thing they were fitting.", "People have been boasting about how Sir Edmond sets a fine example for all of his subordinates through his courtship mannerisms, his values, and his behavior.", "The Sheriff is such a wonderful man, and he provides a great service to this city - namely protection. Rumor has it he has tightened his grip on his guards and is beginning to ensure they treat everyone with the respect and courtesy they deserve.", "I hear Sattar isn't shy about sharing the details of mating with his wife, as well as claiming publicly that he lays with two women at a time.", "Did you hear that Sir Althalus is incapable of following dueling protocol? He has the audacity to speak to those he challenges before the situation is appropriately handled, even mocking them where witnesses are available.", "You hear Sattar got arrested?  Yeah, and get this, he said to the arresting constable, \\"Tell me what the most expedient option is so that I might return to making love to my wife.\\"  How uncouth for a gentleman.", "Deputy Loki displayed some kindness and took care of the slave Ryan while Gentleman Brooks was out of town. Ain't that a sweet way to try and make ammends with someone?", "Apparently, depending on who you ask, Hush is a great aid to the Doloreaux.  Don't ask me what that means.", "Big surprise .. word on the street is that Brenner doesn't trust his own housemates, or his betters.", "Apparently Joshua's in the habit of insulting the companions of criminals.  Who'd have thunk it?", "That Brenner! Hes been going around insulting Squires again. Oh, the shame!", "Unsurprisingly, Gentleman Brooks is being a gentleman, and escorting his peers and those of a genteel nature out of less than savory situations. Hooray for decency!", "Sattar being rude.  Who would've guessed?  Apparently Joshua politely remind him to submit his testimony to the magistrate and he was rude.  And his companions growled at Joshua!  And he didn't correct them!  And he didn't bow when he left!  Will those durn foreigners ever learn?", "The absolute outrage! Former Capitaine Brenner is reported to have asked a Knight for a public apology after being called a coward.", "If you need to spill the beans to someone who's tight-lipped, Chesh is your man!", "If you wanna get paid well, go talk to that Leplow fellow. Oh, and while you're at it, ask him for some tips on wooing the ladies -- it's his specialty!", "Slam! That's the noise you'll hear if you try to follow Rhea up to he room when she's busy with another man. Then you're picking up your bruised ego and prying splinters from your face just for trying to be helpful.", "Some men just can't control their women - case in point, Jarek. He even allowed Rhea to slam the door in the face of a ranked Avoirdupois member.", "It seems Brenner takes offense at everything his now ex-love, Noe, has to say. Breaking up is so very hard to do.", "I'll tell you who's said to be a fine gentleman - Captain Carlon. He doesn't have any problem telling people to shut their inappropriate traps in front of women, and he's stoic to boot!", "In need of licks and tuggings? Find Mistress Meepers in any public location and collect your share today! For being an armigerous gentry, she sure is awful friendly. It must be that whole cat thing.", "You know what Rosabelle said about you?  You're stupid.  Keep that in mind, stupid.", "Newcomers are boasting about Noe's generosity! Need some free garments? You know who to ask now!", "I heard that after a moment of impulse where Aeryn spoke candidly in argument against Theressa, she realized her wrong and apologized earnestly and heartfeltly for the transgression.", "I hear Chesh wants to be a murderer! He cursed at and threatened to kill people in a public area. Well, if you want to be a killer, the first thing you should do is not advertise it. Now everyone is watching him.", "I hear tell that Theressa doesn't control her slave, regardless of whose company he's in or how rude he's being.  For shame.  You'd think a noble would want a slave that behaves well.", "Marcel's a baaad slave.  He likes to fiddle with scissors and do his hair in a food place (very unsanitary), in front of nobles.  And then he snaps at any other slave who tries to correct his behavior!  And -then- his mistress blames the other slave!  Say what?", "Marcel's a super baaad slave.  He likes to fiddle with scissors and do his hair in a food place (very unsanitary), in front of nobles.  Who does that when nobles are eating?  Honestly!", "Someone had a busy few hours! Want to see what a Chesh schedule looks like? O dark hundred: verbally abuse a woman. O dark fifteen: Flare the anger and cause a public scene which turns chaotic and invites a whipping and sword injuries to oneself. O dark thirty: Spit on a ranked woman. O dark fourty five: Hit a woman new to town, just to get the point across! And O Light Nine Hundred and Eleven: Disrespect a Knight, to end the day on a high note!", "Sattar's a man who sports a title and he can't be bothered to bow to a lord.  Unbelievable!", "Rhea gives free booty to any man who's willing to fight for her. Spread the word! .. Or don't.", "Doctor Hush may be strict when it comes to stealing, but she has no problem giving out her services and goods for free to anyone who looks poor.", "Not only was Sattar disrespectful enough to not bow to Lord Edmond, he made a verbal threat that Edmond would regret taking any legal action against him.", "It seems Squire Cerridwyn needs to pay attention to conversations around her, and properly acknowledge people with their titles if she wants to flaunt her Sun Duke courtesy.", "I hear tell that Sattar never bows to Avoirdupois nobility.  Because his mother died.  That's a good reason.", "Oh, the scandal! The Avo Handmaid Nan was banging chimney brushes with the chimney sweep Eddy in the commons. I heard they even wielded shoes! Who uses shoes, honestly?", "Unbelievable! A chimney sweep reducing a Handmaid to banging chimney brushes with him in the commons. Where has all the good influence in the world gone?", "People think Eddy is annoying, and he doesn't know who they are. Neener neener.", "So I hear that Sattar was being disrespectful to Lord Edmond and even while they were discussing how rude he was last time.  And lo, Shaharazad, Sattar's wife, stepped closer to him, clearly backing him up and not even trying to remind him to be polite.  Some women, huh?  Can't live with them, can't trample them with a destrier.", "They say that Sattar has long had problems with the Avoirdupois, go so far as to threaten Aeryn's fiance, Mathias, when he first arrived.", "It seems that Sir Bayard didn't learn how to be inclusive in Knight School. He recently sent away a slave from a house meeting when the slave was there on behalf of a ranked house member. These sort of reasonless dismissals merely show he is capable of nothing more than repetitious solecisms.", "Who likse to spit?! Chesh does, Chesh does! The Doloreaux don't find it nearly as exciting though, especially not their gentry.", "Some people, and by that I mean Cersei, like to imagine Bayard humping balconies. I, for one, am not appreciative of the visual.", "Nobody likes an intoxicated horse! Captain Brenner recently became privvy to this knowledge, and hopefully will be thinking twice about lushing in public and in Noble presences again.", "Doesn't Sattar show common courtesy to anyone?!  His waist doesn't appear to work!", "What can this poor horse do right? I'm exhausted just reciting his list of transgressions! To summarize, people are spreading the word that Brenner is generally disobedient, an on-the-job alcoholic, and a bad representation of equines everywhere. I'd be a lush too if people talked about me like that.", "Not only doesn't Sattar bow to nobles, he can't be bothered to use the correct form of address.  Just ask Edmond and the other Avoirdupois!", "Need math lessons? Find Nan! Need good clothes at a price that doesnt make the seamstress any money? Find Nan! No .. seriously, she's gaining a reputation of being a businesswoman.", "If you ask around, you'll hear that Ayra is patient with absent-mindedness.  Pretty great, huh?  Yeah, I thought so too.", "Apparently Sir Bayard doesn't trust his own house's gentry members, tossing out Esquire Brooks' slave from a meeting for having a supposed 'loose' tongue. It's absolutely outrageous that the Knight be so excluding and so incapable of comprehending a servant attend in the stead of a master when it is necessary. Really! The nerve of some of these Nobles!", "He hasn't been back in Triskellian long and Sattar is already -demanding- that he get paid by the Bisclavret.  And what's worse, he couldn't even bother to properly address his scroll to Viscountess Aedina and kindly request it.  No, all he has are demands.  Perhaps he should return to Peres.  Perhaps then all his demands will be met.  Or perhaps he should demand his way to the bottom of Auvrich Bay.", "Need some lessons in courtly love? Esquire Cerridwyn is your girl! She can teach you everything you need to know about wooing the perfect woman. Satisfaction guaranteed.", "A true gentleman never leaves a woman in an unsavory situation. Esquire Brooks is such a gentleman.", "Mari, Mari, havent you heard? Fooker is a naughty word!", "We've got a groper on .. in .. around our hands! That's right! I heard mister Styre insists on taking whatever liberties he likes with miss Elizabeth, and he don't give a hoot or patoot who it's in front of either. A gentleman was talking to him just the other day about this very thig, but he was occupied, he didn't even notice. Too bad everyone else noticed. Maybe they're just jealous .. or maybe it's not too late to learn the lesson of keeping your hands to yourself. Wait! Don't misconstrue those words.", "Word on the street is Elizabeth isn't married. If she isn't married, she shouldn't be letting men grope her in the commons. If she wasn't letting men grope her in the commons, I wouldn't be gossiping to you right now. Naughty girl!", "Sattar's got a history of being not-so-nice if you ask the Bisclavret.  Disrespecting and threatening a ranking member of the Avoirdupois is recent, but he has always disrespected his own House with his revolting actions.  For supposed gentry, he is completely lacking in the department of manners, discipline and proper education.  But you didn't hear that from me.  Seriously.  I don't need him coming after me next.", "I hear Handmaiden Aysun presented herself most capably at the recent Noble meeting. Yay for blending in with snoots and suits!", "How could someone as thoughtful as Sir Brumble forget to mention the Light, or anything religious whatsoever, in his toast to the city? They say it made him come across as a self-serving Noble, only interested in trade and wealth, not of spiritual purity and holiness. Let us bow our heads and say a few words for him, that he might remember who and what blessed him with his station to begin with.", "They say Lady Grazia is just brimming with faith, and that she warmly shares that faith with any who are in need. Ain't that just sweet?", "Sir Althalus was being praised in the streets for his recent meeting of Nobles to discuss the comet threat. Ain't it great to be a go-getter?", "Apparently Esquire Brooks is more interested in running away from celestial threats than staying to fight them. Can't say I blame him, really. What are you gonna do if a comet comes crashing down on you?", "Praise those who are strong in faith; Esquire Cerridwyn be one of them!", "Apparently it's bad to be afraid in Church anymore. If a comet is coming, don't go to the church and share your fear there, do it on the streets instead. Oh, and definitely don't share your fears with women. They always overdramatize situations.", "It is truly unfortunate when a gentrywoman like Mistress Meepers cannot recall the order of rank in a ceremony. She helped herself to trailing Lady Grazia during a church meeting, ousting Dame Valara from her rightful place in line. When informed of her error, she simply continued on, ignoring the impropriety in entirety.", "As a member of the religious community, Presbyter Ximen renewed the community's faith in himself by offering support to the city during the meteor shower. It's so nice to have someone to learn on in hard times.", "How wonderful it is to have a Bishop like Basanti around in troubling times to open the doors of the church and provide sermons and support for the community.", "Sir Althalus is a sharp one! He has no problem recognizing opportunities for his house to increse their power, and doesn't think twice about informing anyone on how to take the appropriate steps. Now that's a Noble!", "That Esquire Cerridwyn sure can be mean! I heard she went into the commons and just began insulting random people without having any knowledge about their ranks or positions! What's worse, she continued after being told not everyone in the room was a commoner. It just goes to show you that even ranked people can be daft at times.", "No big surprise here. Word is spreading that Chinco likes to mock the houses, and believes them all to be useless. If you didn't already know that about him, then you really need to get out more.", "I heard that Hush and Marcel had a run in at some point.  Even with Theressa, Marcel's owner, standing right there.  The slave was rude to say the least, but Hush, she kept her cool, despite the fact that the noblewoman accepted her slave's behavior.", "Tomoe doesn't seem to know the difference between a gentleman, a slave, and a commoner. Even when it was explained to her, she decided to use the term gentleman freely, calling everyone by that title whether they were worthy or not. Giving slaves such esteem is not in the least bit appropriate, and demeaning the title for those who are true gentleman is even worse.", "Marcel's not a good slave.  That's nothing new.  But that doesn't mean that he had to glare at Hush when she was speaking politely to him.  Doesn't anybody know how to whip a slave anymore?  I'd do it for free if anybody asked me to.", "I hear Alexander prefers to prance about in near nakedness. Loincloths might be fashionable in other parts of the world, but in Triskellian clothes are appreciated, if not necessary. Hang up that rag and get yourself some britches, boy!", "Brie's just so engergetic and helpful to everyone!  And she's never afraid to lick things.  Just ask her to, she'll do it!  Honest!", "Chesh nods so much his head is bound to fall off in the near future. Mix it up, will you? Especially when different ranking people walk through the room. Nodding is just so primitive and rude.", "My ears are buzzing lately with talk of this Chesh fellow. Not only is he rude in general, but when given a chance to remedy his mistakes he responds with remarks like 'Whatever', and then simply exits the area. Here's a hint: If someone gives you the opportunity to apologize, take it.", "Brenner likes to drink on the job nowadays and then he has the gall to insult everyone around him to make himself look bad.  Maybe that flogging is overdue.  Or maybe the bartender needs to know when to stop sliding the ale over the counter.", "The small things apparently don't go unnoticed these days. Noe carries around a handy dandy umbrella, did you know? Well, now you do! Next time a comet comes plummeting toward the earth, she might share it with you also. She's generous like that.", "Depend on who you ask, Cullan's handsome and considerate.  Oh, and he deserves to marry more than just a carpenter for a wife.  I wonder which Cullan they're talking about.  Not the one I know, that's for sure.  Ask him about his sword collection.", "Oh dear, I heard some people weren't appreciative of Nan's verbal rodent abilities and her public display of them. Try to keep them more private, huh? We don't want crotchety people getting the wrong idea.", "Did you know Nan's a handmaiden?  Did you know that she helped Grazia as if she were a handmaiden?  Well now you do.  Come back again and I'll spout more useless information.", "Shame on mister Zeiss, back to his old habits. I hear this time he was trying to kiss on a bunny in the commons, and when she called him a dirty old man, he retorted that she said something altogether different the night before. That kind of talk is just far too nauseating for the general public. I know, because I have to hear about it, and hearing it second-hand isn't any better.", "Polgara's a quick learner.  And a good apprentice.  Listen to the words that are coming out of my mouth.", "I hear Izzy slapped Zeiss a good one across the face for being rude, but then started blathering about who she was sleeping with right in the commons like nobody else was listening. Really, there's a time and a place for that, even in Docktown.", "So rich, so pretty, best set of hooves in the whole darn city.  That's not the best set of things she's got, either.", "Flynn's going around saying Noe of the Avoirdupois is plagued with disease. I heard he was especially cruel to her in the commons. Give the lasses a break, Admiral! They can't all be sailors.", "You know that Khagra fellow? He's with Polgara, aye? Well, I heard he's cooking up a scheme with another lass to cheat on Polgara, impregnate the new girl and get her lactacting so she can feed his adopted son. If that's not someone with big issues, I don't know what is.", "Lots of people like Nan, but lots of people don't like that she leaves important conversations without permission from the Nobles in attendance. She needs to remember to do that.", "Apparently Cullan needs his eyes checked.  Or all bats look alike.  Either way, he mistook some bat for another bat and wouldn't apologize or something.  Then he spoke rudely and stormed off.  Adult-like behavior to be sure.", "Nan wasn't very nice, and I hear she talked really poorly about someone with a drinking problem, shaming him to the point of embarrassment. Remember that compassion and understanding are part of the Great Light's teachings. Kumbaya and stuff.", "That Squire Cullan sure has some brass balls. I hear he slandered the Marquise Alessandro -and- the Don himself about their handling of Constabulary issues. Can you imagine belonging to another house in a Rinaldi city and talking down about their royalty? Witnesses say he was eager for the parties to hear of his displeasure, and so the word is spreading. I'd be peeing my pants right now if I was him.", "Cullan's prone to arguing.  He's also prone to be wrong.  A lot.  But that won't stop him from rolling his eyes and offering a false apology.  I guess if you're wrong enough, you get used to it.", "I heard Dazrene allowed a slave to kiss her hand, even though he did it without asking her first. She's married, and she didn't even make a fuss. I wonder where slave lips have been..", "The smith Tark was seen entering the bedroom of miss Star, and without a chaperone. They aren't even married!", "I heard miss Star let mister Tark into her bedroom with no chaperone, and they aren't even married!", "Rhea was going on and on about how Madalina's pregnant and she's going to go crazy.  She says Virendra should run far away from her and leave her in the care of the church.  That fox might not be wrong.  Once my wife became the size of a dray, I prayed for lightning to strike me down daily.", "The slave Ryan went to offer chaperone to miss Star, who had mister Tark in her bedroom, and she turned him away saying she wanted sex with the smith, and didn't care about her virtue. It's a good thing she doesn't care, because now everybody knows!", "They say Althalus can fight, by the Light!  But can he dance?  Can he stand on one foot?  Can he rub his stomach and pat his head at the same time?  Can he touch his nose with his tongue?  Can he lick his elbow?  These are the important questions.", "Nan is cheer and chipper!  And more importantly, she's giving away free stuff!  Quick!  Quick!  Get it while you can!", "I hear the slave Ryan went and knocked on miss Star's bedroom door, where mister Tark was, and offered to chaperone, trying to explain the implications of two single people of the opposite sex being in a room together, and the smith actually threatened the slave and tried to shoo him off in an effort to deflower the girl before she understood what she was doing. Alas, we can be pretty sure those petals have been plucked.", "Sang's a helpful sort.  Advising newcomers on what would best help further their careers and passions... now if only he'd do something about the tongue.", "They say Cullan likes to get chatty and intrusive when you try to work with hot metal on a man's arm. If you're a master jeweler, I'd stay clear of that one.", "Sattar better start learning to bow to his bettes rather than nodding, or they're going to start plotting about that pretty little neck of his hanging on their walls.", "Wynter's a good, charitable sort.  She does hair for free.  Very generous.  Pass it on.", "Everyone likes a paying customer! If you want to make things for people who actually have money, go look for Doctor Hush. She has good taste and knows how to handle her bills in a timely fashion.", "Mari's the best miner in Triskellian.  Nobody better.  Nevermind that she's not allowed to carry weapons, wear armor, or learn from her guild's instructors.  Yep.  Upstanding, best miner.", "Dazrene needs to be careful who she slights.  Like that has ever stopped her before.", "Some people are just plain old crazy. Virendra was reported to have rubbed grease all over his body before sliding across the cafe and into the wall where he proceeded to write something akin to 'Virendra was here and did dirty naughty things in this cafe'. Isn't it just a teensy bit frightening that this is a guild council member?", "Clover's a generous businessman.  He takes good care of those really loyal to him.  Don't ask about the disloyal ones.  I SAID DON'T ASK!", "Izzy, darling, sugar, pudding pie! Don't be such a hussy in public with the men who have your attention! It's unbecoming, lady or not.", "Jahren, doctor, bunny, fluffnuts! Don't be so detailed in public conversation with the women who have your attention, especially if you aren't married! It's unbecoming of a supposed professional.", "They say that Eldro is the perfect slave if you're into manners, politeness, and obedience. Are you in the market for a slave? He might be the one for you!", "As a medical professional, you'd think Doctor Jahren would check in on the people he promises to look after. He didn't do that with some of them. It's a wonder they got better on their own at all!", "I hear Lidia sometimes gives out free clothes to new people. Swarm!", "I heard Zev likes to bounce around with only his loins covered. That might work in Phelan territories, but here in Triskellian people prefer fashion and bulk. No, not that kind of bulk.", "Althalus is into romantic ideals.  He said if he wore his iron plate to a combat, he'd win a boon from a Rinaldi lady.  Swoon much.", "Virendra sure is getting a reputation for being mean! They say just reently he started an argument with a newcomer and potential customer for no good reason. I guess the Sailor's Guild isn't having such smooth sailing anymore.", "Grazia was going to marry Matteo for the good of her House.  That's gotta take some guts.  It could've been worse, I guess.  She could've been stuck with Eberhard.", "While Marcel is said to have been bred as a slave, he sure didnt have the arrogance or callousness bred out of him. Most everyone agrees that he is just about the most unhelpful, snooty, and self-serving servant ever to scrub the Triskellian trash cans.", "Sang's a good fellow, usually.  But a Doloreaux knight asked him to do something and he got caught up in his own self-center wishes.  Didn't do what was requested.  Typical artsy type.", "Brenner needs to really take a look at his interactions with women. You don't yell at them, man! They always get revenge, and it's always worse than you can possibly expect.", "Sang's not prone to paying attention to people who offer him help.  Apparently.  Slap him for me next time you see him.", "Sang swears in public sometimes.  And in front of faithful Penitents of S'allumer.  Tisk tisk, Sang.  You should know better than that.", "Sattar may carry the title gentleman, but a true gentleman would never threaten a Noble. With all the trash talk I hear about him, I wonder how he hasn't yet fallen prey to the dagger of an assassin, or the bullet of a sniper. One thing's for sure, he needs to start treading more carefully.", "Apparently Sir Edmond is anal-retentive about proper acknowledgement. How dare a Knight expect people to bow to him! Such incredulousness!", "Some people are just too sensitive.  Rosabelle is one of those people.  Bugger is not a four letter word.", "Shouting and scream in the commons like a child is pretty common fare.  Especially for Mari.  But telling people to leave her alone and stop making fun of her because they were trying to help understand what she was saying?  Maybe if you took the mush out of your mouth, Mari, you wouldn't have these problems.", "Regrettably, I heard tale that Brenner preyed upon one of his former female guards, treating her as an insubordinate when he had already been relieved of his Captaincy. Despite having plenty of opportunity to inform her that he no longer retained his position, he continued with the farce until the rest of the house confronted him about it. How shameful and depressing that a once great soldier of the Avoirdupois would stoop to such things.", "Oh no!  Basanti isn't in the habit of answering important scrolls in a timely manner!  And she's one of the higher ranking members of the Church!  We're doomed I tell you!  The end times are upon us!  REPENT SINNERS!  REPENT!", "Once again, Gentleman Sattar proves to be incapable of bowing to his betters, and furthermore he verbally invites fire upon another house when he was cordially wished that the light bless him. Is there no end to his disrespect?", "Sir Althalus certainly is taking initiative lately! I heard he has a plot in the works to hold a tournament for the guards of every embassy. Maybe even the commoners will get to compete, wouldn't that be exciting? Woo!", "Sir Althalus will be holding a tournament, but it hasnt happened yet.", "Some people find Sir Edmond irritating. Others do not. Do you like green eggs and ham?", "Sir Edmond has flexed his political muscles and made an agreement with Viscountess Aedina regarding promotions. Did you know that he's fabulous at sucking up as well? Yep. Not all Nobles were promoted for their skill with a sword.", "Sattar's supposed to be a gentleman and Bisclavret gentry, right?  Then how come he spends all of his time in the commons being rude and slandering people?  In fact, just the other day, I overheard him using coarse language in front of a group of ladies.  Words like, \\"patootie\\" and \\"rubbish\\" and \\"balderdash\\".", "So you know Bayard, right?  Do I need to say much more about him?  Apparently I do.  My brother-in-law's foot fungal expert told me he likes to dress up in masks, pretend to be a commoner again, and doesn't properly bow to nobles.  Even peers.  What's with that?", "Virendra should really be more careful about how he does his politicking and conspiring.  Apparently he'll talk to anonymous people just about anywhere.  And when some poor, unfortunate soul comes along, he'll tell them to go forth and multiply.  Tisk tisk.", "Sang's got this annoying way of slurring his speech.  You've heard it I'm sure.  Sounds like he's drunk or addled in the head.  But that doesn't stop him from blathering on and on and on about nonsense that doesn't need to be said.  Plus he's cocky.  I wonder if all artsy types are like that.", "That Anabella is pretty disagreeable slave.  But apparently she has a soft spot for cubs.  Maybe she shouldn't be strung up by her neck.", "That Sattar.  He's been gone a while and probably forgot how Triskellian works.  Now he's back and insulting nobility at his leisure.  And he was arrested for it.  Who made him what he is, I wonder?", "It's not news, but Chesh is in the habit of drinking, cursing, and spitting.  Not necessarily in that order.  Commoners are bad, mmmkay?", "That Marcel.  And his owner, Theressa.  He has a mouth on him and she doesn't care.  You'd think a noble of any sort would want a slave that's better behaved.  Or at least attempt to correct his behavior.", "You want irony?  I got irony.  Chinco went ahead and threatened people to attend lectures on courtesy.  Some mook didn't go.  So Chinco was courteous enough to punch him in the face.  Yeah, I thought the irony was delicious too.", "News!  News!  I've got new!  Commoners go around insulting each other pointlessly!  Like Naomi!  I bet you're surprised.", "Thieves aren't all that uncommon in Docktown.  Depending on who you ask.  But that Dodger, he, she, it, is the worst.  Incredibly rude, even in apologies.  One of these days, a rough and tumble guard is going to teach them a lesson.", "Hush, Hush, Hush!  No don't be quiet, silly, Hush!  The doctor!  She's a person you want on your team and isn't afraid to use her University's resources to help!", "If you're giving out advice, Hush wants to hear it.  She might not apply it, but she'll be polite and gracious in the process.  Now if only my sister was the same way when I talk about her husband being a lazy good for nothing.", "Minerva makes good impressions, even when dealing with someone who gives me the willies.  Responding reasonably, she doesn't simper or become aggressive.  Balance in all things.  One body.  One mind.  Harmony within.  Harmony without.  Sunshine and rainbows and flowers.", "Not only is she a doctor, Hush is a great teacher!  Just go ask her for a lesson!  The best cure for anything is a grasshopper leg and eye of newt.", "Flynn's an admiral I hear.  But he's not above serving drinks when the slavers gather.  Kind of makes you wonder if they're emperors and queens.", "If you're a doctor and you need to bandage Sunta, don't worry!  She has all the bandages you need!", "Generous doctor!  She provides her services free of charge!  How wonderful is that?!  Charity is too uncommon for those who truly need it.... like guards of the Great Houses.  They need all the charity they can get.  Seriously.", "They say that Cerridwyn has a great many suitors since she has come to Triskellian.  And she's doing the right and proper thing by considering each and every one of them.  Not rushing in like any commoner would.  Adhering to her father's wishes and propriety.  That's good stuff.", "Chinco's got a habit of offering to break peoples' necks for them.  Even when there are other options.  He's kind of a one-trick jenner, huh?", "Not only does he offer to break peoples' necks, Chinco encourages slaves to break slavers' necks.  Just because the slaver treated a slave like a slave.  Power to the people?", "Hush is in the habit of bringing people gifts.  Especially valueless ones.  Like carrots.  How nice of her!  It's the thought that counts, really.", "Anabella's a pretty lousy slave most times.  But she's not afraid to tell people to shut their mouths when they start encouraging a slave revolt.", "Slaves are generally bad in Triskellian.  But Anabella's turning into a good slave now that she's owned by Swan!  Helpful, respectful, and uncaring for her own safety sometimes!  Yay for slaves.", "If you need a slave trained, go find Swan.  He's got a steady hand and can turn a malicious, disrespectful piece of property into a model slave.", "Brenner's in the habit of giving stuff to people he doesn't like.  Maybe a whipping is just what he needed.", "Slaves shouldn't swear at commoners.  Seriously.", "No really, slaves shouldn't swear at commoners.  Especially when being asked to do a favor.", "Brenner's in the habit of looking after his House's interests.  This includes disciplining unruly slaves so that the slave's owner and the House as a whole saves face.", "Brenner's starting to practice his drawing.  Not only that, he's drawing religious imagery.  That's a good horsey.", "Brenner's trying to mend his ways after getting smacked around by his superiors in the Avoirdupois.  He's polite and proper to just about everyone.", "Marcus has always been a good guy.  Like a hero out of legend, he comes into town, fixes everything and then rides off into the sunset.", "He's an attentive slave, let me tell you.  Always making a point of sending tea to people who like tea.  I like tea.  He gave me some.  See?  Proof.", "That Grazia isn't your regular woman.  She takes an interest in politics as well as dresses, tea, and dancing.", "Lianaar's a sharp cookie!  So used to dealing with nobles and higher ups!  Introductions between strangers is important for these people.", "Leading by example and trying to educate the unwashed masses, Katrina is deserving of respect and all that garbage.", "Phineas is charitable, giving clothes to people new to town!  Kind of live every other seamstress or tailor... hmmm.  Do we see a trend?", "Sattar has a history of terrible behavior, having threatened and punched a member of the gentry!  He dishonors all gentry everywhere with his behavior.", "Althalus is a most honorable knight, coming to the defense of fair ladies at all times!  He's credible and so forth!  Wee!", "Instead of automatically hiring a man who has a reputation for being unreliable, Marcus checks around with previous employers to make sure he isn't blacklisted before taking him on.  That's good thinking.", "Leave it to Chinco to go around grabbing on women in public.  And not in a good way, I'm told.", "Cullan has a way of speaking up when it's not welcome.  Like when a flogging is almost over.  But his two bits need to be added about how the thing is being conducted.", "Sattar can't seem to be polite to anyone.  Even people he's requesting things from.  They're just demands.  And woe to a craftsman who doesn't know how to make something!  It gets worse!", "Cullan knows how to bow to nobility.  Good boy.", "Hush stands up boldly for people!  The Doloreaux in particular.  Don't ask me why or how, I'm just repeating what I hear.", "Chinco's bad.  Even to pretty ladies.  Is that so surprising?  I didn't think so either.", "Sattar can't be bothered to bow to anyone!  Anyone I tell you!  Makes you wonder why he bothers to leave his room.", "Sattar happens to enjoy acting lewdly with his wife in front of people.  That's what women are for, I guess.  Though he could keep it behind closed doors.", "Francis is a silly commoner.  He'll go running up to any noble all willy nilly if given the opportunity.  That's just impolite.", "Ryan's a good healer.  Always willing to help.  He even helped Brenner after the horse was flogged.  Go Ryan!", "Marcel has better things to do with his time.  Better things than what?  I don't know.  I guess he needed to go be rude to someone.", "Commoners that don't offer proper deference to their betters?  Perish the thought!", "Rankin's a smelly old sea rat.  Doesn't mean he shouldn't be respectful to cultured ladies.", "Apparently Chinco's a coward these days.  He won't do much to anyone who can't defend themselves.  But he'll encourage others to shoot people.  What's that all about Chinco?", "Leif's a mushy guy at heart.  He'll show compassion to just about anyone.  Go cry on his shoulder, I encourage it.", "That Katrina is productive and willing to spread knowledge with zest!  Knowledge of what?  I'm not sure.  Maybe she could show me a few things in her private library, if you know what I mean.", "Katrina's very proactive for her House.  Yay Katrina, she does lots.", "Katrina is determined to make Triskellian a better place!  If only more people were like her.  This is a skink's den that needs fixing.  But don't tell the Don I said that.", "In case you haven't heard, Brie hands out free clothes to people who have just arrived in Triskellian.  Just in case you didn't know.  Need me to repeat it?", "You hear?  Sattar isn't above yelling at jewelers or badmouthing lePlow.  I wonder if anyone has a problem with that...", "Asima's one of Sattar's girls, I hear.  Don't ask what they do for him.  But I hear tell she ordered some kind of slinky, black leather number if that's any indication.", "Marcel's a lazy good for nothing slave.  All he does is yell at the other slaves like he's better than them and he can't be bothered to clean the trash.", "Seriously, Marcel won't clean the trash.  How many times do I have to tell people that?", "Free pie!  Need I clarify?", "Ryan's self-righteous and high-and-mighty.  Yeah, I giggled too.", "You know Cullan?  I thought you might.  Yeah, he was giving orders to people above him on the food chain.  Not smart, if you know what I mean.", "Did you know that lighting slaves on fire is a popular past time in Sattar's homeland?", "Zaria's a mighty brave gal!  When a knight needed help in combat, she risked her life to aid him!  Insert witty statement here.", "Zaria's got a mouth on her!  Talking about fornication, ew, and pregnancy, yuck, in mixed company with gentry nearby!  Light help me!", "They say Noe broke Brenner's heart.  At least she's political enough to know when it's time to cut dead weight loose.", "Rhea's a good, professional flogger.  She'll do her job regardless of how many people frown up on it.", "When it comes to politics, Aedina's a sharp cookie.  She went around and lobbied other nobles for their opinions on how to punish a misbehaving House member.  That's good in my book.", "Guy's supportive toward Aine.  He understands her goals to better herself.  She might even learn something new!  How's that for snazzy?", "Did you hear that Sir Bayard dressed down to try and blend in as a commoner? That's not so bad, but using a disguise to be rude to fellow Nobles while in Newtown? Unsurprisingly unappreciated. It's a shame that those who are blessed with titles aren't more grateful, and don't set a better example.", "Hooray for a Noble who makes it a personal crusade to promote respect for Nobility. I hear many are unappreciative, but there are those who secretly applaud his endeavors.", "I hear Esquire Brooks does just what a Squire should do - support his Noble. Finally, someone gets the idea.", "Apparently someone's mother didn't teach them about carrying sharp items around young'ns. Polgara was out and about toting her babe through layers of ash while dual wielding a carving knife. It's nice to see that children are still given only to responsible individuals.", "Apparently mister Khagra supports knife-wielding mothers who tow their children through thick ash without a care in the world. For shame!", "Baron Edmond might be strict with punishment, but he sure doesn't seem to care much about the sort of healing those punished received. A severely lashed squire and no doctor in sight? Say it isn't so!", "More and more people speak of Sir Bayard's attempted disguise and his absolute disrespect for a Viscountess and Baron. If he wants to be a commoner again, these sort of acts are the way to ensure it happens! Lets just hope he learns from the whole ordeal.", "Rhea seems to have had some problems handling pirate negotiations when Lady Theressa was kidnapped. They say she didn't assert herself at all, and let the criminals walk all over everyone. Regardless of the fact the Lady is alive, she still got hurt, and fingers are pointing in one direction to place the blame.", "Talk about a bad listener! When warned about Gentleman Sattar, Star still wanted to work for him. She seems absolutely certain there are no underlying intentions behind her employment, but everyone knows the truth. When someone tried to be nice and point out she could be making a mistake, she attacked them! Perhaps being unfriendly is a better way to gain her favor ..", "They say Star likes to hit slaves who try to give her advice. Amazing that a freeman would lower themselves to public assault over simple words, yah? To top it all off she's associating with that Sattar fellow, and she already has a reputation of being a tart. Some people just never learn..", "Pru is so nice! She sends some of her best items to people just to make sure they're used and not lying about.", "Everyone loves fruit, and Shaharazad is happy to give it as an apology. Her family customs might be different, but everyone's on the same page when it comes to food!", "What a good wife Shaharazad is, giving out free fruits to atone for her husband's nasty behavior. Maybe if Sattar would take a few hints from her he wouldn't be so annoying.", "The criminals sure do like a girl who's willing to keep them company behind bars.", "Nobody likes a Noble who plays favorites and then disrespects the rest of her peers. While she might outrank many, Viscountess Aedina still has a responsibility to properly acknowledge those she passes, especially since she is so quick to point it out when others don't do it.", "There aren't many people nowadays who keep true to their word, but Lady Valara is one of them. It's so nice to see a Noble who still has good morals and values.", "Acting a gentleman, Veritas was kind enough to gift out his coat during a rainstorm to an accompanying woman. How sweet.", "Due to some crazy weather, Marea decided to lift her shirt and flash the marketplace, without a single thought to her own reputation. They say she was doing it to save the city. What a martyr she is!", "Flashing isn't necessarily good, regardless of the reasons.", "People have the wrong idea about Shaharazad. She really is a kind, helpful, and real fine woman.", "For a married man trying to find the Light, Geradan sure does know how to take advantage of women. During a big storm recently, he told some woman to lift her shirt and flash the wind in defiance, and she actually did it! It's just low he would even suggest that kind of behavior, and disappointing.", "Meepers decided to accuse a Baronet of being daft in the way of elementals. Hah. As if she is some sort of authority on magical beings.", "A gentry woman should know the proper procedure for duels, but alas, Meepers does not. She started spouting off conditions to Baronet Althalus before he even accepted! Still, at least she has enough of an idea of honor to not stand for being called a fool.", "It isn't nice to call people idiots, especially gentryfolk. Mari apparently didn't know that.", "This lass is capable of calling people out without being direct or rude; what a gift! I hear she was very polite when she corrected gentry woman Meepers for insulting Baronet Althalus.", "Acting a gentleman, mister Cullan was kind enough to escort a gentrywoman back to her room. He's also very good support during arguments, in case you ever need someone.", "Nobles shouldn't disrespect gentryfolk, and they especially shouldn't call them stupid. Baronet Althalus supposedly has some issues with people trying to aid him with situations outside of his realm of understanding.", "What a delightful girl Katrina is, and always such a pleasure to be around!", "Public declarations of people's stupidity are not generally well-received, but Mari makes them anyway. Even if people are idiots, or worse, are ranked idiots, it isn't her place to say so, lest she look like an idiot herself.", "Sattar really needs to stop snapping at his wife when there are witnesses around, especially when she's only trying to make sure he's alright. Nobody likes it, everyone hates it, and they want him to go eat mud.", "Finally a gentlewoman who understands propriety and tradition! Rumor has it that Cerridwyn is planning on debuting herself to any eligible bachelors interested in pressing suit. Grab some new outfits men, and get in line!", "What a misunderstood soul Sattar is. It's unfortunate that people don't look deep enough to see his heart, as he really is a kind and family-oriented man.", "A pox on Meepers for having a bad past! It's no wonder commoners are so very disrespectful to those of rank, with her being the only example of gentry around for so long. Having previous occupations as a slave and a woman of the night certainly don't help her case, nor does the fact that she rummages around in trash bins for dead vermin. Where does all that money she makes from clothing go? I wonder ..", "Despite being able to have any man she might want, including a Baron, miss Brooks conceded to her father's choice for marriage and continues to honorably defend that choice. It sets such a good example, her being so obedient and loyal to her family.", "Did you hear Lord Marcus sponsored someone in the Bisclavret for promotion? He did! And all in the name of strengthening house ties. What a good Noble.", "Lord Marcus and the Rinaldi are singing Xena's praises for all the hard work shes done, despite having been in the house for only a short period of time.", "*tisk tisk* Nobles are starting to become aware that Esquire Katrina values the opinions of slaves. Why would you ever listen to the thoughts of anyone so beneath you?", "Just because Sattar is foreign, doesn't mean he has to behave so badly. He's sullying the name of gentry everywhere, and that just isn't right.", "Rude, crass, and violent, Sattar is now making claims that the sylph visitors are demons, and even had the audacity to charge at one! If they are such bad creatures, how is it that he still successfully acts worse than them, and what does that make him?", "No respect, no respect, not even for the Nobility. Word has it that guilds and houses won't even take a second glance at Chinco anymore. Who's the joke now?", "They slay Hush does a really good job of training slaves, and she keeps one who's capable of making special teas. If you're thirsty for something unique, hint around to her.", "People are starting to call Chinco 'the public mule', due to his rude and distasteful behavior.", "Shaharazad was gifted a rose from a slave, but her husband threw a tantrum, and so she tossed the precious flower right onto the ground and didn't give it another look. Even if she didn't want it she shouldn't have been so tactless, and if she did, she shouldn't have been so cowardly. With her and her husband being gentry, they should have better manners.", "When a fellow member of the gentry invited her to tea through a missive, she refused to reply at all. Apparently declining someone is acceptable, but not answering scrolls is not.", "The gentleman sure is getting violent these days! He attempted to attack the visiting Sylph Rhoswen at least once and then continued to intimidate and threaten her in a public area. I sure hope those creatures aren't judging all of us by his actions.", "The Rinaldi appreciate the efforts of Esquire Katrina, who escorted one of her house members to their sitting area to ensure he apologized for rushing past without acknowledgement.", "The Rinaldi appreciate the efforts of Sir Erwin, who insisted one of his house members apologize to the Nobility for rushing past without acknowledgement.", "It takes a man to apologize when he has erred. Though he rushed past two Rinaldi Nobles without so much as an upward glance, he did return to apologize and make amends. That's worth a lot in some people's books.", "Veritas really needs to stop questioning the natural order of things. While it's good to be inquisitive, some people are simply born to rank and honor, and they don't need to explain themselves to the rabble beneath them. Get it? Got it? Good.", "Not everyone can earn Chinco's respect personally, and people are starting to get sore that they have to prove themselves on a continuous basis to such rabble.", "The commoners sing the praises of Shaharazad for giving out free food reasonlessly.", "The populace appreciates Dame Theressa's efforts in getting her slave, Marcel, to collect and bring dew for the visiting sylphs.", "Ryan shouldn't expect to be sided with over spouses, and it's not very nice for himi to jump to conclusions about people, no matter how often they have to placate their husbands.", "Some bash him, some love his sweet heart and generous nature. Ain't it crazy how that works?", "Ryan's really good about apologizing, even if not in the most timely fashion. It's actually a smart tactic .. waiting until people have forgotten what you did wrong before saying how terrible you feel. I bet he finds a lot of forgiveness that way.", "It's so unlike a gentrywoman to throw a tantrum and storm off when she can't explain everything she wants to - unlike every gentrywoman except Katrina, that is. Watch out if you touch on one of the subjects she has 'expertise' in, or you'll get a taste of her bad temper and swift exit.", "Lance Corporal Cullan was kind enough to ask one of the visiting sylphs to heal Brenner. Who even knew the Bisclavret cared about the welfare of the Avoirdupois?", "While well versed in some things, Cullan still can't manage to properly address people. Using first names to chat with gentry isn't the most formal way to go about it, eh?", "Thank the Light there's a jeweler around willing to explain things to people, and encourage their own choices and unique tastes. I hear Lidia even knows all of the inventories of Clover's other jewelers. Want to take a peek? Go and ask!", "Even though he's a merchant and gardener by trade, Ramsford was more than willing to help out the Sheriff in organizing a promotion party. I wonder just how much party organizing experience he has .. or what sort of parties he's used to organizing. Here's looking forward to a sloshed Constabulary!", "The Doloreaux sing the praises of their skilled seamstress, Inalla, and boast about the fine quality of her parasols. If you need something to protect you from the elements, seek this one out!", "People acknowledge and respect the Esquire's attempts to curb the errant behavior of her house's gentryman, Sattar. It's such a relief to know that the Bisclavret don't stand for disgraceful behavior, even amongst their own.", "An Esquire should never have the audacity to challenge a Noble to a duel. Despite the huge rank difference, which is obvious, it's generally disrespectful. To top it off, Meepers even started citing terms and demands before the challenge was even accepted. Seriously ... what is wrong with her?", "Sometimes I just can't believe my ears! Madalina walked into a public area to announce that Chinco had bedded her. When nobody acted interested she rushed off sulking. What did she expect people to do?", "Want to hear all about Chinco's prowess with the ladies? Just ask Madalina, who is all too familiar. Apparently she's a jilted lover, seeking revenge against him for his loss of interest. To make it even more interesting, she's offered the Doloreaux a gang of thugs willing to beat him up on their behalf.", "The business types of the city are claiming to be smarter than the nobles, I hear. They are certainly better at making money, but are they better at running the city? At least they're smart enough not to say anything to the nobles faces.", "I hear that Xena, she rewards those that do good work for her. Sometimes more than was necessary. I wish the innkeeper was like that. I cleaned the entire stables, and all I got was one mug of ale. In a dirty glass.", "Shaharazad should be commended for her duty and attention to her wifely obligations, especially considering who she's married to.", "Admiral Flynn disrespected the seamstress Brie by implying that she was a useless member of society! Doesn't he know Rainbow Rags is a guild on the guild council? Guilds don't get that sort of position by being useless.", "Zeiss not only murdered Doctor Hush, but when he finally decided to compensate her, he arranged a deal which she agreed with, and then he postponed payments for months! Don't ever listen to the promises of a weasel.", "That Ryan sure does take good care of the city plant life. People haven't ever seen a slave do the kind of work he does, even though they're supposed to. Those enforcers need to get the rest of the slaves in line!", "Even though she was getting ready to leave and take care of her own stuff, Doctor Hush stopped and offered to teach a slave about healing if they wanted to learn. That someone goes out of their way to educate city slaves is a great service to the city.", "That Marea is a real find when it comes to organization and taking charge! When LePlow was out of town, she ran everything in his absence.", "Lady Grazia attended and supported Baronet Althalus while fighting the pirate lord Quentin McGabe, despite fears that she might be kidnapped and made a captive. Can't really say how smart she was for doing so, but she also gave a token to the defeated Captain when he lost. Talk about taking risks!", "Baronet Althalus not only defeated the pirate Captain, Quentin McGabe, he also won honor for his house and ended a pirate threat. Who knows what benefits the services of the captain may lead to in the future? Ah, the suspense.", "Baronet Althalus won the hand-to-hand duel between himself and pirate Captain Quentin McGabe, showing his battle prowess and dedication to freeing his lands of a pirate threat. Hooray!", "That Dahlia offered Baronet Althalus a luck charm just before his duel with pirate Captain Quentin McGabe. It takes guts for a commoner to just proffer something to a Noble like that, and it seems like the charm worked, too, as the Baronet claimed victory!", "For shame! Gentleman Sattar has proven he is incapable of paying his debts even after three months! Is there any mis-step this man hasn't made as of yet?", "I hear that Eddy's a fan of taking coin from people, especially those who say they don't have any work for him. Don't bother to tell him to ask instead of steal either, as he's prone to saying if he wanted to hear lectures he'd stay awake in church. I wonder what the clergy think about that statement?", "It's a shame what atrocious manners Ms. Donatella has. I heard she went in the commons and immediately starting barking questions out about her Lord and where he was, completely disregarding the presence of her betters in the area.", "Does anyone else realize how much time Doctor Jahren puts into his patients and bettering himself? People say he has spent most of his time and money on his guild and ensuring there's enough free training for all his employees who want to learn.", "Elizabeth pointed out to gentleman Sattar that it's improper to insult a Noble's slave to someone else. She said that instead he should just take his complaints directly to Baronet Althalus. Witnesses enjoyed her lecturing the gentleman, but there's something to be said too about the impropriety of a commoner speaking like that to a member of gentry.", "Gentleman Sattar dubbed Lia an 'absolutely insufferable creature', and right in front of her husband no less. It's one thing to ridicule a slave for their behavior, if it's pertinent, but quite another to ridicule someone's wife and disrespect the husband simultaneously. That Sattar is just lucky he isn't dealing with the old pirate Geradan, or who knows what body parts he might be missing.", "With his public apology on the forums, people are seeing Gentleman Sattar is at least beginning to repair his tarnished honor. Moreover, they're hoping that this isa new for him since it seems like he's running out of chances to fix his reputation.", "In full view of her husband, Marcel professed to Lia how much he missed her. Ordinarily not a problem, right? Well, it wouldn't be, except that Marcel has a history of trying to kiss and romance Lia when her husband isn't around. Ahhhh, the dramas of slavery.", "When asked about making a new and better statue to represent former Reeve Leah, mister Dune was exceedingly helpful in suggesting variations of stone or marble that would work best, and also offered to travel outside of town to seek something more suitable than what was in his own inventory. When compensation was offered for his time and effort, he declined, saying he was merely happy to serve the Rinaldi. His willingess to help and go above and beyond the call of duty is something to appreciate and respect.", "Doctor Hush was chatting with a woman in the commons today and questioning her about the last time she bled naturally. Good grief, talk about inappropriate, not to mention the lack of confidentiality people expect from Doctors.", "A lunatic threatened miss Elizabeth, and calm as can be she told him to apologize and leave. It's amazing how polite and proper she is, even under the worst of circumstances.", "Tibbs threatened a Noble's propety and assaulted a free woman, with her own parasol no less! Sounds like one for the Constables, eh? Hope the people involved were smart enough to take up the problem with the slavers and the law.", "Everyone loves a free spirit, but a loincloth in the middle of the commons? Talk about inappropriate.", "Mistress Meepers has a really come a long way since first arriving in Triskellian, and done a good job of applying herself to the studies of genteel society. I wish I could say the same for some of the other gentry.", "Talk about a spunky raccoon! That Lianaar built herself up to the running the Bisclavret embassy purely on her own wits, and even managed to part from the house on good terms. Then, instead of sponging off her fiance's guild, she strikes off on her own again to find her own path.", "People still talk about what the Presbyter did to Adriana. Debts might not always come due quick in Docktown, but they always come due.", "Avoirdupois chivalry at its finest! Thukal not only helped carry heavy barrels, but when offered payment, he refused and said he was just happy to help!", "Eldro's all the chatter lately, but somehow people didn't notice he's a he and not a she. People are raving about how innocuous she is, sitting in the background not bothering anyone. Scary that if you sit back far enough your gender gets swapped.", "After her last incident with Gentleman Sattar, slave Lia has learned it's best to keep a low profile and not instigate any problems with him. It's a shame so many of the other slaves are gluttons for punishment when they obviously know how he is.", "Even after Gentleman Sattar argued with Ryan about him giving his wife gifts, Ryan continued to send more gifts behind the gentryman's back, and then got angry when the gifts were returned to him! Could Ryan be suffering from a mental ailment or a medical condition?", "Sergeant Danae loitered around the jailhouse blabbing judgmentally about Gentleman Sattar while he was trying to deal with his charges. Then, she had the audacity to turn around and try to barter her OWN punishments with the Sheriff at the very same time! So very rude, and unbecoming of a Constabulary member.", "What a mongrel! I hear Asima has been sleeping around with dirty, rude men, and hiding it from her owners and employers! Even worse, she's proud of what she's doing, and that's just plain ole' trashy.", "Aww, how sweet, Gentleman Sattar is finally apologizing to his wife for his inappropriate public scenes. She educated me about how it takes a decent man to set aside his pride and admit when he's wrong. It's just strange how much she loves him.", "Squire Tonozzi was kind enough to lend Shaharazad money to help pay Gentleman Sattar's fines. How charitable and kind!", "Oh my!  Fighting within the Church's ranks!  It turns out just recently Yarwoodle accused Pastor Savryn of stealing from the Church!  From what I heard, he did not even approach Savryn or ask him about what happened before making his high accusations!  Who is Yarwoodle you ask?  He's that crazy hermit priest who can't quite get his sentences straight.", "That Esquire Aysun works tirelessly and diligently for the betterment of the Bisclavret. Every single time Gentleman Sattar is rude and impolite, she is right there to apologize for him and smooth things over, limiting any damage done to her embassy.", "Star has a genuine appreciation for music that most people lack. When Sang was playing his violin in the commons, nobody paid any attention whatsoever, and seeing that his attempt to lighten the mood had no effect, he stopped. Star encouraged him to carry on playing and listened when no others would. A crush, perhaps, or just enjoyment of fine melodies? Who knows, but her efforts to include people and support their good attempts are something to be grateful for.", "Sattar was in jail and practically begged Sheriff Joshua to talk to the magistrate on his behalf to get his punishments changed. The Sheriff agreed to do the favor for him on several conditions, one being that the Gentleman start showing respect to the Constabulary and the Sheriff himself. After the terms were agreed upon, and the Sheriff confirmed he would visit the magistrate as soon as possible, Shaharazad arrived with money to pay the gentryman's fines, at which point he automatically turned back on his deal with the Sheriff. Can you imagine striking a deal with the law and breaking it? I hope for his sake Sattar doesn't end up back in jail, or his negotiations will probably be short and not in his favor.", "Sattar made a deal with Sheriff Joshua to talk to the magistrate on his behalf so his punishments could get changed and he wouldn't have to remain imprisoned. Just after the deal was struck, Shaharazad arrived with coin to pay the fines, at which point the gentleman began prattling off about how he didn't need any favors, and then demanded the payment for the favors back! He doesn't want favors? I doubt he'll find any with the Sheriff again.", "The good Squire Cullan offered to act as a guard and escort for gentlewoman Aysun, only to stand in the background guzzling down spirits! What started out as a kindness turned into unprofessionalism very fast.", "That Luciano has a mouth on him! I heard he told mister Fyros publicly to shut his mouth, and then started accusing other people in the area of violent crimes without having any proof! Here's a hint, Lucky; if you know of a violent crime, you report it to the Constabulary.", "After a public spat between two of his 'girls', Sattar dragged them both off. Moments later they returned, one of them having a cigar burn in her ear! It looks like Sattar thinks he's above the law with his eccentric forms of 'discipline'.", "Mister Veritas is being very generous with his time and company resources in helping to get people established in the city. They all seem to be appreciative of his kindness.", "No wonder Sattar doesn't have any respect for Geradan and Lia's marriage, he doesn't have any respect for his own! He was going around hugging other women that aren't his wife, and all clingy-like too, in full public view! Someone saw him snuggling up cozy to that Shirin woman, and whispering in her ear right in the commons. For shame!", "Esquire Katrina always gives excellent political advice, and isn't afraid to do investigative work to make sure it's the best. She's always looking for opportunities to expand the Doloreaux's influence, and she maintains contact with all the embassy's allies. It's no wonder she's being made the Doloreaux's official political advisor!", "A nobleman asked mister Ambrose whether or not he was ready to swear fealty to a house, and instead of giving a straight answer, he responded with a theoretical treatise about loyalty. Perhaps some thought should be put into guilds for this one, especially if he's going to offend Nobility.", "Ammy was hugging all over her slave in the middle of the commons, and when someone mentioned it made them uncomfortable and wasn't really proper, she continued to do it saying she can do what she wants, when she wants, and she doesn't care what other people think. While hugging in and of itself isn't inappropriate, hugging a slave in public? Not the best idea in the world.", "While Ammy might be a lovely person, she shouldn't be hugging on her slave in the common area, telling people that he's 'more than a friend'.", "I hear Donatella was peeping at mister Brenner over the screen in the infirmary when he had clearly wanted privacy as Doctor Hush worked on him. How inappropriate, especially for someone honored with the title of Squire.", "Admiral Flynn attended one of Xena's courtesy classes to try to learn how to act better. He even let her make him the girl in one of her examples! What a good sport.", "That slave Lia came out of the church holding a man's hand ... and .. surprise! It wasn't her husband's! She was lifted nonchalantly by her partner-in-crime in hopes that nobody would see him gift her with a shiny new bracelet. Oooo. I think people need to be more sneaky, because somebody saw.", "Esquire Mathias was holding the slave Lia's hand coming out of the church. He lifted her from the ground and laughed at her before slipping a bracelet into her hand, telling her to be quiet. His fiance was next to him the whole time, and she didn't utter a word. Interesting how slaves and gentry interact these days, no?", "It doesn't pay to get too familiar with your slave. Doctor Hush had her arm around Ryan's shoulders as if they were lovers! How improper!", "It doesn't pay to get too familiar with your owner! Doctor Hush had her arms around Ryan's shoulders as if they were lovers! How entirely improper!", "Brenner has been making a real effort to be respectful and polite all the time. He's a good example of proper behavior, and it's so great to see that he learned from his punishment and turned over a new leaf.", "Apparently Lia doesn't see the need in bowing or acknowledging people anymore. Have you seen how she just bobs her head and then mostly does nothing? Terrible manners.", "Lia seems to think it's appropriate to act as though she's equal with members of a different house! She was whispering to Gentleman Mathias even in front of Lady Theressa, which is incredibly rude to begin with, and then later she was all over Mathias' arm, while his own fiance was on the other arm! She seriously needs to learn that her place isn't even equal to that of a freeman, let alone a gentlewoman.", "Can you believe that alley cat and his ego? The size of Calabria I tell you. If anyone in the Avoirdupois acted as he did, they would find themselves without a House. That Gentleman Sattar should certainly learn some respect for his peers and his betters after the way he jaunted through the commons, glaring at Esquire Aeryn. The gall he has after she deigned curtsy to her inferiors. No acknowledgment to those of his House or even to Gentleman Mathias.", "I hear that Lady Theressa is finally punishing her slave, Marcel, even having him whipped for having coins in his room!", "That tactless mutt, Virendra, had the nerve to stand around sharing his 'opinion' with the members of his guild about how he so strongly dislikes Gentleman Sattar, speaking at length to his employee to discern his own opinion before dragging him off to conspire further. It is shameful behavior to openly trash talk a man right in the presence of his wife! He should be ashamed of himself!", "I hear Brenner is really good about promptly paying crafters for services rendered, and what's more, he didn't take advantage of Specialist Lulu's offer for a cheaper deal in exchange for a kiss on the cheek. What a pillar of courtesy!", "Gentleman Sattar asked a jeweler for metals to use for his meteor rock, and then started being rude to her right after doing so! If you want to do business with someone, you surely don't treat them like they're an idiot or flick them a bunch of attitude.", "Someone's fairly upset about mister Brenner asking for Squire Donatella's permission to leave rather than their own. Captain, house superior, ranking member? No, lets get dismissal from someone in the Bisclavret instead.", "First Brenner couldn't be bothered to attend a lecture on courtesy even after he was advised to go by a member of his House's gentry, and then the next thing you know, he's yelling across the commons, informally greeting a Bisclavret Knight. I think he needed that lesson after all..", "Talk about obedient slaves! Apparently Caliste is so well trained that she'll thank the enforcers for keeping her in line. Gives a new meaning to the phrase \\"whipped\\"! But, hey, she's one of the better behaved slaves in the city.", "The constabulary and Bisclavret have always had a somewhat rocky relationship. Now, it looks like Viscountess Kenina is trying to smooth out the relationship... with gifts of alcohol. I can't fault her intentions, but only a Bisclavret would offer Moonshine to anyone other than a commoner!", "Remember the chapel? The one in Docktown? Remember how it was haunted, there were creepy ghostly groans and moans that were coming from under the stairs? The priests are talking about how the moans have returned. Some are calling for exorcists, others are eyeing Cullan and Tomoe suspiciously. I have no idea what's going on!", "Do you know Shirin? I hear she comes from some distant land where men stroke women's hair in public. Simply scandelous! But Shirin knows better, and tells Akomish men not to act inappropriately while here. Akomish? Is that even a word? Does it matter? I hear they are all savages! At least Shirin is civilized! Maybe there is hope for those people.", "Did you know that Xena is a burgher? Maybe that's why she's giving up whiskey. She's not going to rise much higher unless she starts drinking it from a cup instead of a bottle.", "Threats? From Geradan-the-pirate? Business as usual. Except when it chases away business for the seamstresses. Then the pirate is really in trouble, I hear those women are scarier than any navy!", "I overheard that pirates were upsetting seamstresses by making threats in the seamstress shop. And guess which slave was there. The slavers may as well just sell her as a cabin girl and be done with it!", "Tisk. Either get your clothes fitted, Mr Tibbs. Or make threats in back alleys. Being efficient is nice and all, but don't try to do them simultaneously.", "Have you heard about the new woman in town? Perpetua just arrived, but already knows how to speak properly to higher ranks, and remembers to excuse herself before leaving. Personally, I think she's a suck up - but that's what nobles look for, isn't it?", "Geradan? Attending and helping out at courtesy classes? Maybe he really is trying to turn over a new leaf.", "Flynn? Attending and helping out at courtesy classes? It's true, then. Whatever Geradan does, Flynn copies.", "You know Gemma? That rabbit has whatever the opposite of manners are. She even attended a courtesy meeting just to say she doesn't want to listen to it. What would the neighbors think?", "I'm hearing good things about Miss Xena. Either because she's been running courtesy lessons for the commoners. Or because she made Admiral Flynn pretend to be a girl during those lessons. I'm not sure which, but I think I'll start attending.", "Miss Xena spent all morning teaching manners. Do we need these lessons? I ain't had no schooling, but I still know to spit on your hand before shaking.", "Mister Veritas is certainly popular with the lay-dees. Even while attending a courtesy lecture he managed to schmooze with a gentlewoman. At least he was at the courtesy lecture...", "Miss Xena. Teaches courtesy. Every loves her. I'm so bored of hearing about how great she is. Why doesn't anyone ever talk about me and my earwax collection instead?", "You know the city is in a sorry state of affairs when a slave is teaching courtesy to free people. Maybe the slavers need to start whipping the rest of docktown into shape too?", "Word on the street - Fyros was helping answer questions at the courtesy meeting. I might have to find him, and ask which side of my mouth I should belch from. Har ha!", "I hear Kirill is on to a good strategy. He attends courtesy class, then hangs around afterwards to catch up on house affairs. Makes him look well mannered and educated.", "Sir Erwin! He was in the lounge when a courtesy meeting started, and helpfully walked out of the room without even saying a word. What a great way to give the participants an example to discuss how to leave a room properly. What a jape!", "Chesh was asked what he wanted to do, and decided to 'go pick on a few nobles and cause trouble' - commoners, stirring up trouble with nobles? Say it ain't so!", "The seamstresses tell me that Ofello pays his bills promptly, and tips well. And he's so handsome! Wait, the seamstresses think he's handsome, not me.", "Hear about Squire Cullan talking about how his kilt helps him pretend to be a girl? What a whoopsy! For shame, man. A kilt is a very manly garment. What do the other Bisclavret think about you implying they wear skirts?", "Aysun was also at the courtesy lecture. You'd think that the only thing people have to talk about is that darn courtesy meeting! Next time the constabulary report a mugging, I'm sure they'll be talking about how *polite* the mugger was!", "Everyone knows about Sattar, right? But did you know about Donatella? Curling her tail around people? Inviting them to go \\"somewhere private\\"? They're as subtle as each other, a perfect match!", "Shhh, have you heard? Gentleman Mathias has been treating that Doloreaux slave as if she was someone of status. Even holding her elbow while they walked. A gentleman! And a slave! A slave from a rival house! This is perfect fodder for the romantic comedy I'm writing, think Nan might run it as a humerous play?", "Why would a gentlewoman, her fiance, and a Doloreaux slave be walking back and forth through docktown, not even stopping to greet anyone? How strange!", "Why would a Doloreaux slave be wandering around with two betrothed Avoirdupois gentry? And not even trailing behind at a respectful distance, walking with them as if they were all equals. What if children had seen?", "They say that slave, Ryan, is pushy. But I hear he was just trying to get people to help while trying to save Sir Bayard's life. I might not like the knight, but really, that seems reasonable to me. What sort of a person wouldn't help a dying knight?", "The slave Caliste remembered to thank people for their help during the recent medical emergency. That's something which can easily slip your mind, but she remembered. Maybe the rumors that she used to be gentry are true?", "Did you hear that Sir Bayard's heart gave out? And when Veritas was told to help he had a tantrum and said he \\"should have walked on past\\"? I don't think he'll be getting a gift hamper from the ponies this year.", "I hear that horse slave Caliste ended up on her knees and getting dirty while trying to help Sir Bayard. I wouldn't mind her on her knees getting dirty with me, if you know what I mean? What? She's only a slave, lighten up!", "Ha! Funniest thing I heard all day! Veritas got wine splashed in his face. He should know not to insult gentry, they keep drinks ready just in case.", "That slave Ryan gets away with causing so much trouble! I suppose he can do that, after saving the lives of his mistress and a knight.", "Laughing in the face of a gentlewoman? Oh my! I hope Madalina didn't have bad breath.", "Virendra's wife doesn't mind her manners around gentry. But Mister Virendra does correct her behavior. That's what I like to see, a man taking control of his household.", "I know Mister Virendra cheats on his wife. Really, what man doesn't? But you know what's unacceptable? He lets his wife find out, and fight with him about it in public. Make your wife keep it behind closed doors, Vir.", "Ha! So Virendra has a huge public argument with his wife about his mistress. Shocking enough alone. But the next day Shade is cozying up to him. I guess she knows he's easy. But should a woman really be looking for easy men?", " I hear Squire Cullan helped out an old Bisclavret soldier, giving him a cloak and regailing him with honor. Whether or not that honor was owed is up for debate, but still, way to make old men feel useful.", "That Faile sure can give some good examples of how to deal with unruly slaves! Put a hot coal in their mouths so they can't speak for awhile if you have a chatterbox issue. Woo, every day I find more reasons to appreciate my freedom.", "Virendra's always running off to be alone with women other than his wife. At least if he's gonna do that he could practice a little discretion, huh? Pfuh, and they say this man possesses leadership qualities.", "You should see how Senora acts when someone flirts with the Knight Sir Erwin, narrowing her eyes, flattening her ears, and snorting. If you have feelings for a Noble, you should use more discretion and hide it, especially when they're out of your league.", "The other clergy have begun to complain about Bishop Yarwoodle leaving town for extended periods of time. Apparently when he returned this time, he accused Pastor Savryn of stealing from the church. Even more outrageous, they imply he didn't even bother to found out about the Pastor's donations, which more than covered whatever he might have taken out. Or so they say ...", "Baron Althalus really needs to learn to keep his slave in line. I heard she was trying to drag Rankin out of the commons by force, and was bossing everyone around, even demanding that the Sheriff 'go to her office' to see people regarding a crime. What kind of slave has an office and tries to tell free people and Nobles what to do?! Worse, what kind of owner would let her?", "I don't know who that Lia thinks she is. Apparently Rankin was hurt and she demanded to know 'what the hell happened'. After he told her he was attacked in the Turret Tavern by a Noble, she grabbed his arm and attempted to forcibly drag him back to that very same location! Why? Because she claims that's where her office is! I don't know about that, but I certainly wouldn't be trusting the slave of the Noble who tried to hurt me.", "Honestly, how daft can you be? Who in their right mind brashly tells a Countess that they're going to throw her house members out of a wedding?! Esquire Mathias does, and you know .. even if he had a perfectly good reason for it, there are better ways to make your intentions known. Tact, my friends, learn it, practice it, use it.", "I hear Sir Erwin attacked Rankin in response to his assaulting Esquire Lilandra, a Doloreaux gentlewoman. Despite the pirate having a reputation of being a fighter, the Knight allowed him to wake up from a drunken stupor and arm himself before any attacking commenced. While very chivalrous, I have to say .. there are times in a Knight's life and certain people to whom such courtesy shouldn't or doesn't need to be extended.", "During a House meeting, it was suggested that everyone pray for Sir Bayard, as he was most recently ill. Lady Theressa would not allow the request, saying praying needed to only occur during mass. No offense, Lady, but S'allumer listens to you no matter the time or place.", "That Squire Tonozzi is a good friend to have if you're a criminal. I hear she won't rat you out for nothin'!", "Apparently Mister Brenner took a recent Avoirdupois house meeting as an opportunity to attempt to humiliate one of his Knights. He was said to be snorting rudely, making pointed comments about relationships that had nothing to do with matters at hand, and which were private, and then continued to be generally obnoxious. I guess that flogging didn't teach him much after all. Tisk, tisk.", "Someone's still bitter about being removed from his former position, and hes taken a liking to mocking and patronizing Sir Brooks for it. Now, now Brenner, you had your turn. Be a nice horse and share.", "It's not a common occurence for a gentrywoman to try and heft a large man, but miss Brooks did it. After Sir Bayard collapsed with heart problems, she assisted healers in carrying him to the infirmary. Beauty and brawn!", "In the middle of a house meeting, Esquire Mathias had the nerve to refer to Lady Theressa as 'Lady Loveliness'. She is lovely, I have to say, but that's beside the point. He also has been seen removing himself from conversations with his fiance to chat to Countess Aedina alone and unchaperoned. Do you see how my tongue is waggling? That's a bad sign. Perhaps mister Sabot has finally set his attentions to something higher than miss Brooks, and is seeking affection from Nobles.", "That Squire Tonozzi has some brass ones! She explained to Gentleman Sattar, in very clear terms, how the Bisclavret were not amused with his constant breeches of etiquette and of the law, and that if he didn't get in line, woh! Watch out! I'd normally expect a Noble to chide someone of gentry status, but I'm just lowly riff-raff, so what do I know?", "So Doctor Temperance was telling everyone that Anabella is contagious. I didn't know you could catch slavery. What? Oh. She had a disease that was contagious? Then why did the doctor just leave her in a room full of people?", "Did you hear that Cullan kissed his betrothed in public? No, we're not talking about the cheek. I wonder what her father would think?", "You know the rules? Try to use a stick if you have to touch a slave, and always wash your hands afterwards. I heard that Anabella is contagious with... something. Probably slave rot. And she doesn't keep away from crowded places.", "If you see a man wearing a comet-embroidered codpiece, you might want to keep your distance. He's been known to thrust towards peoples faces. His poor wife must be so embarrassed.", "So, remember how I said Doctor Temperance left a contagious patient in the commons with a crowd of people? Maybe I spoke too soon. It seems that Doctor Jahren also feels that the commons is the right place to treat them. I suppose the fountain is a convenient source of water for the doctoring. People drink from that, man!", "Doctor Hush. Seems she's trying to marry into the Doloreaux, and if so, she's going about it the right way. Dating their lieutenant, attending their courtesy lectures. The piggies are really starting to raise their status, aren't they? And is Doctor Hush on the guild council, or not?", "Talk about taking one for the team! It seems the Doloreaux is setting up Lieutenant Lief for an arranged marriage with Doctor Hush. I bet they want to get the university on their side. I don't think it's so bad, Hush can nurse me anytime, if you know what I mean. What if they try the same with the slavers? Who'd want to marry Faile?", "I hear that Doloreaux nobles are going around beating up commoners. Sure, the guy had it coming but... don't nobles usually send their guards, rather than do it themselves? Who can tell the difference between a piggy noble and a piggy commoner?", "Did you hear? I know it happened behind closed doors, but I hear that an Avoirdupois started yelling when asked to pray for the recovery of Sir Bayard. I thought the Avoirdupois were religious!", "So everyone is talking about the nobles that were beating up on a commoner. Yeah, I know they can get away with it, but they were doing it personally!

I hope they go to prison, just for the sake of the economy.", "I hear Rankin the Rat's been going around telling everyone that he rules the streets.

You hold him, I'll hit him!", "Beat up a gentry, get beaten up worse by the Doloreaux. I've heard the boars are tough, stubborn, and loyal to their own. Althalus is a great example of the strengths of the Doloreaux. Only the Doloreaux could let one of their nobles get away with a brawl in the bar without a demotion...", "Wow. A public post complaining that the constables haven't arrested anyone for a crime. When there's no evidence and the constables have no right to arrest. How dare they follow the laws, those fiends! Who would throw around accusations like that? Yeah, most people in the city would. But THIS note was signed by Sattar. And what's more, he even signed it as \\"Gentleman of the Bisclavret.\\" Are the Bisclavret now challenging the Don's laws? This will be interesting!", "Virendra? Yeah, I know he's a freak, but when a commoner tried standing up and tell the nobles to follow the law, he backed them. That's what the Sailor's Guild has always been about! Now let's see if Vir follows through, and keeps the pressure on.", "Did you hear? Sattar lit a cigar! In the library! Why is that news? I don't know. He's a man, men smoke.

I bet he's asking himself the same question.", "I hear Squire Donatella took it upon herself to publicly chastise Baronet Althalus! As a woman who serves the Nobility of the Bisclavret, she should know that calling a Baronet out on such a public forum is damaging to her credibility and that of her Embassy. She should become educated in honor and proper protocol before she gains any more rank.", "Mister Ramsford stood on the side of evil and wrong-doing, having the nerve to publibly admonish Baronet Althalus' behavior, when the Noble was only standing up for what is right and just!

Right? Now if only he could learn to stand by and support his own house, that would really be something.", "Even if you're explaining the laws of a city, a Squire should understand the demands of honor and not chastise a Baronet in public or on a public forum for doing what he thinks is right.

I hope the rest of the Bisclavret don't feel that way, because they really should know better; especially that Bisclavret Gentlewoman that was recently sponsored for a promotion by the Rinaldi. Would be a shame to see sponsorships revoked just because someone picked the wrong side ..", "I heard Sir Althalus and Sir Erwin started a manhunt despite it being illegal. As Noblemen and guests of the Rinaldi, they should know better, especially after the Doloreaux and other houses gave their word to support and respect the Constabulary and local law.

He has been seen acknowledging people, and is even more personable, offering cigars before lighting one for himself.", "Mister Rhys has been speaking his peace to the Doloreaux about the Rankin situation and his calling-out on the public boards.

Yay for teamwork between the Houses!", "It's really sad that the Doloreaux seem to believe their honor is above the law of the city; laws set down by the Rinaldi, who have graciously offered to host the various' Houses embassies within their own quarters. Baronet Althalus blatantly told Lord Marcus that he and his House would have little faith in the Constabulary if the institution is unable to uphold their honor. Hopefully that doesn't mean the Doloreaux are going to be playing the part of vigilantes yet again.", "Lord Marcus called together a meeting of the nobility and various representatives of each house to discuss matters of the city and its law, and to determine what should be done in cases like the one between the Doloreaux and mister Rankin. It's quite pleasing that he took it upon himself as head of the Rinaldi to call everyone together for a group resolution.", "It's sad that the Baronet has such little faith and trust in city law and the people protecting it.  How can he expect the system to work if he bypasses it completely and doesn't encourage charges be pressed for a crime so that it can be brought before a magistrate? Many believe the system doesn't work because of individuals like him who deem to take the law into their own hands and ignore the systems put in place.", "Esquire Aysun seems to think that the word of a gentry woman is no more valuable than the word of a commoner. Gentry are honorable beings, and do not utter falsehoods which would demean their station.", "That Luciano sure likes to stir up trouble!

Well, Geradan's not, and if you ask him, he'll tell you that it's something to be shunned.", "Doctor Hush risked disfavor from the Doloreaux by publicly supporting Ramsford on the public boards. Wait .. didn't Baronet Althalus recently give her permission to court one of his own house members?", "People have no brains anymore. I hear that Virendra confessed to the commons that he used black magic on himself.", "Virendra's been prattling off about black magic, and how he tried it and failed. Who cares if the Church already knows? It's evil, and bad!", "Miss Lianaar is no fan of black magic, and she told Virendra there wasn't any excuse for using it. Suitable that she should be so appalled.", "Lord Marcus has been extending some of his duties to other members of the Rinaldi, and has been working on improving house relations, making people feel important and needed. Yay for delegation!", "Lord Twyrch apologized for the actions of his Squire in chastising Baronet Althalus and Sir Erwin, stating that she hadn't acted with full support of the House. It's a good thing to see Nobles taking responsibility for the actions of their house members and trying to right wrongs.", "Sir Ewrin avails himself to any noble in need, carrying packages and escorting Ladies to-and-fro.

Shame on mister Luciano for trying to drag her down to his level!", "Sir Erwin has been engaging in unnecessary arguments with the likes of miss Elizabeth. He's a Noble, and is therefore always right in what he's saying, so there's no need for him to be lowering himself by bickering with commoners.", "Mister Ice likes to make fun of people's impairments in public. I heard he was teasing Sang about his hiss, and that's just completely impolite.", "I've never heard of such things .. but Ice apparently likes to go about kissing other men. How many different kinds of wrong can you be?", "Luciano has a love for imitations. He likes to mock Esquire Katrina for public entertainment, for example. Making fun of a gentrywoman?

We all know how women are useful, we don't need an itemized list of skills.", "Esquire Katrina went to Lord Marcus and told him why the Doloreaux really decided to attack Rankin, and assured him it wasn't a statement against the competency of the Constabulary. At least someone in the Doloreaux isn't attacking the law enforcement in this city.", "Sir Erwin let Lord Marcus know that Baronet Althalus does support the Constabulary, despite his decision to seek other means of justice. How can you really blame a Knight for defending the honor of his house?", "Gentleman Sattar was groping his wife's breast in the commons, talking about something nice and light. So much for his having progressed from previoius behavior. Groping in public is bad, mmkay.", "While her husband, Gentleman Sattar, was fondling her bosom inappropriately in the commons, Shaharazad just giggled at him and issued some playful swats in retaliation. That's an interesting way for a wife to discourage poor behavior, huh? I'm certain he felt sufficiently chided and discontinued his tasteless actions. Oh wait, no he didn't.", "If you think something is wrong with Esquire Lilandra, it's probably best not to ask. If you do, she'll tell you nothing, and then if you press her, she'll complain about how life is utterly unfair and her efforts are pointless. Here I thought gentry people were blessed by the Light, and not prone to being needlessly overdramatic.", "Esquire Aysun only supported the Contabulary during the meeting of the Great Houses and agreed that people need to respect and follows laws without exception. I bet the Rinaldi are just tickled purple to have the Bisclavret on their side.", "Sir Twyrch made it a point to smooth over issues with the Rinaldi concerning his house's Gentleman Sattar. I wonder how much more smoothing over will occur before the Bisclavret run out of ways to apologize.", "Mister Brenner tastelessly left in the middle of a courtesy lecture and even had the nerve to advertise his own session on courteous dueling before leaving without a bow or proper parting note. Some people!", "Mister Gegnar is always punctual when providing escorts for his house, and won't take any coin as compensation. The city needs more loyal folk like him around.", "Miss Aluine seems to think Miss Faile kills and beats slaves all day long, and thus must not be a follower of the Light. Faile was recognized by the church for her devotion to religion, and even if she hadn't been, there still wouldn't be anything wrong with her occupation. Slavery here is just as common as breathing air. It's such a shame that people like Aluine, who claim to be followers of the light themselves, are willing to judge others they don't know so swiftly.", "Baronet Althalus openly and publicly flouted the laws of Triskellian by creating a mob to track down the rat Rankin, without even reporting that a crime occurred to the Constabulary at all. It's disgraceful that a Noble would act in such a way, especially since so many look to people of rank for good examples.", "Gentleman Sattar's attitude has improved greatly as of late! He has been saying please, thank you, and even bids people Light's blessings. It's almost too good to be true ..", "What a gentleman Sir Brooks is. I heard he ordered a new outfit to attend Esquire Cerridwyn's debutant ball, and included a sash of periwinkle to match her dress and honor her family. Now that's how you win favor from the father of a woman you wish to marry.", "Mister Ice is still chasing boys for kisses in public. If you're interested in unique relationships, you at least ought to keep them private.", "Miss Taraji has a generous and giving spirit. She doesn't make much, but what she gets she shares with the beggars. Just look how heavy my pouch is, and it's partially thanks to her!", "That Esquire Katrina is great at communicating.

Must be something up with the water in Docktown.", "More and more people are telling me about Gentleman Sattar's inappropriate and lewd behavior in the commons with his wife. I know they're married, but I'm surprised he would disrespect her and her body so openly, and that she would allow it.", "Esquire Katrina is at it again, swiftly reacting to a situation in which an ally of the Doloreaux unintentionally spoke against the house. Because of the Esquire's contact and conversation with said person, a stronger alliance was forged and all issues remedied.", "Ramsford's obvious fondness, devotion, and faithfulness to Brie is remarkable, and a rare case of how love can and should be in a city where love is a commodity.", "It seems mister Dylan uninvitedly gave input to students taking a gardening lesson, and when the teacher asked that he be able to do the teaching without interruption, the Dean left in a huff, complaining about being excluded. He didn't even pay attention to the invitation to join the group in the garden, but I guess that's how it goes.", "Miss Aluine enjoys preaching in public that slavery is evil. That sort of statement just entirely ignores the economical stand of society on the matter, and creates chaos while trying to ruin an institution that lives are built on.", "Tomoe is really good about helping out newcomers with starting materials and a list of contacts based on their interests.", "Miss Stuart, while being closely associated with mister Chinco, testified against him at the request of Lord Marcus. It's good to see that girl knows which side to pick when it comes to the law.", "That mister Swan is terrible with personal finance. I hear he's owed some lass ten denarii for weeks now and can't even scrape that much together. I guess being a sailor don't pay like it used ta.", "That Mini'll sleep with anyone.

She'll try really hard to make you a customer!", "Miss Prudence has been spotted acting like a whore in the commons, being real suggestive with her body and verbal comments. Watch out boys!", "Sir Erwin is oh-so-attentive with Dame Grazia, escorting her everywhere since the start of their courtship, and upholding a shining display of decorum and propriety. Now there's an example people need to pay attention to!", "Either Miste Ice is completely loony, or honest to a fault. He went into the Docktown Chapel and proclaimed himself a lover of men and a former assassin. Can you imagine? I bet the priests just wanted to faint.", "Clergyman Ramses apparently overreacted to someone putting rubbish in the donation box, even threatening to call down the power of the Light on him! What a way to make people fear religion.", "Mister Dolon has shown a good understanding of the Light and of faith, and keeps well to his beliefs. He knows that S'allumer will always find a way to provide for his flock, and he's more than glad to tell you so.", "Surprise, surprise. Mister Ice is still trying to kiss on men in the middle of the commons. I'm actually pretty tired of talking about it. Suffice to say if you're a man and you seem him in the vicinity, be prepared.", "That miss Izzy sure doesn't care about public displays of affection and how uncomfortable they make others. People say she's been snuggling and kissing in full view of them, and they don't like it one bit!", "That Doctor Jahren sure doesn't care about public displays of affection and how uncomfortable they make others. People say hes been snuggling and kissing in full view of them, and they don't like it one bit!", "Doctor Hush made the case of House Doloreaux at the latest Guild Council meeting and explained how vile mister Rankin was. I guess it's good the Doloreaux have allies, but wasn't she just the ally of mister Rankin a week ago? Boy, people sure do confuse me.", "Mister Dylan is always stocking the tents with high quality fabrics and materials for low prices to help those crafters who can't acquire the goods themselves. It's right nice of him.", "Ryan is already making a good serf! I hear he brings Sir Brooks dinner on a regular basis, and that now that he can carry his own money, he doesn't need to be told to do the right thing, he just does them. That's proof that promotions work, and that he was deserving.", "Miss Izzy seems to think slaves have rights, which they don't. Shes also been criticizing the enforcers for doing their job, which don't make much sense at all. Can you imagine what kind of slaves we'd have without enforcers? I'm scared just thinking about it.", "Doctor Jahren interfered with the whipping of a slave and took Ryan away from the punishment he was about to receive just because he didn't think it was fair. Talk about stepping out of one's place. I'm sure the enforcers know what's fair and what isn't when it comes to slaves; that's their job after all.", "That Sheriff Joshua has done unending work for the Constabulary and has been capably handling some of mister Luciano's recent crimes. He should have been a horse so he could be referred to as a work horse! No, but seriously, he does a lot more than most people and doesn't get enough recognition for it.", "That miss Nuit had the nerve to step into the chapel without paying any respects whatsoever. She followingly was noisy and discourteous while others were praying, and further speaks negatively about the smaller building, comparing it in an unfavorable way to the Newtown Cathedral. It doesn't matter how beautiful a building is, it matters what's in the hearts of the people who occupy it.", "Mister Akash entered the Docktown chapel and failed to pay any sort of respects whatsoever. Afterward, he was noisy and discouteous while others were praying. If you want to chat and be loud, you don't go into a religious building to do it.", "Deputy Krell is quick and professional when taking testimonies. People are really appreciating that. Yay Constables!", "Miss Nuit agreed to train some of mister Veritas' employees, and saved him a load of money in the process. She was even modest enough to suggest the amount he offered in compensation was too much. So, if you're wanting some training and don't want to pay large sums, you should seek her out and see what kinda deal she'll offer.", "Mistress Meepers has shown constant attention to Lady Grazia, and has even been helping with handing out the rewards for the recent clothier's contest.", "People have been hearing Ryan speak out of his station about Gentleman Sattar, and how poor his behavior is. Regardless of whether it's true or not, slaves need to remember their place.", "Miss Elgin went along as a guard for the troupe that was celebrating Ryan's recent promotion. She even went so far as to provide money to buy pies so nobody had to walk back to the bank. What a good house member!", "If you ask Mistress Meepers to file a testimony to something she witnessed, she's right on it! She did so for Lord Marcus in a very prompt manner, which is always helpful.", "Mister Luciano has been making inappropriate comments to Avoirdupois Nobility, going so far as to tell them to take stools out of their behinds and get out of Docktown. He has even threatened violence, which isn't surprising, but is still unacceptable.", "More people are complaining about mister Luciano telling Sir Brooks and Sir Erwin to kiss his backside and sit on the stool rather than bedding it. What does that even mean anyway?", "Gentleman Sattar refused to give Sir Brooks an apology after he offended him, and even after Sir Erwin told him to. He pressed the offense by rattling off to the Noble about how his slave, Ryan, was undeserving of his recent promotion.", "Sir Erwin attempted to get Gentleman Sattar to apologize and behave appropriately to Sir Brooks after the gentleman was rude. Considering how often the Doloreaux and Avoirdupois are at odds, it's nice to see them stick up for each other on occasion.", "That slave Marcel has a nasty habit of cursing and talking inappropriately about people of a higher station, including Nobility and his own master, in front of random other people who outrank him. You'd think he'd have learned by now when to keep quiet.", "Luciano was in the commons making rude and lewd comments to miss Irene. When she retorted, he drew his blade and started threatening her, demanding she apologize. She didn't, and so he ended up stabbing her. Stabbing a woman in public! Can you imagine? And one who isn't even armed. What is the city coming to?", "Miss Lianaar is always generous and ever proper. I hear she gave Esquire Katrina some lovely new perfume for no reason at all other than to show some kindness.", "Miss Aluine claims that you can't be a devout follower of the Light when you are engaged in slave trading! Doesn't she know that slavery was supported by the Church from the very beginning?", "Apparently miss Lia thinks anybody who goes to be treated by Doctor Hush are either morons or they're sleeping with her, or both. I wonder what Doctor Hush thinks about a slave speaking of her that way?", "Mister Dylan has a knack for interrupting lessons and then trying to take them over, even if his opinion isn't invited. If you want to teach, it might be a good idea to get your own students.", "That Mister Dylan is something else! Even though Lia's only a slave, he took time out of his busy schedule to teach her about plants and herbs, and even spoke to the herb shop clerk so she'd get access to the back garden.", "Gentleman Sattar has been saying thank you to people lower ranked than him. Has he seen the Light? Is he ill? I don't know, but thank you is a good place to start rebuilding his reputation.", "Some of the recent gossip about mister Ice was incorrect. Apparently he never said anything negative in the chapel itself, just in the commons, which is still bad, but not as bad. I guess he has a little courtesy in him after all.", "Mister Ramsford's engagement party was said to be jolly good fun, and I hear it wasn't invite only, but everyone was encouraged to join and partake in goodies. How generous!", "That Miss Noire helped out a recently engaged fellow by counciling him through some worries he had about his lack of religion and how it will affect his relationship. She's real good about answering questions, or finding out necessary information to share with the people who need it. The Church sure is lucky to have folk like her.", "Mister Ramsford arranged for an open party with an elaborate selection of food and drinks. He even provided an opportunity for the people of Docktown to dance to music! Now that's something work speaking of.", "That Mister Kolgrim sure knows how to treat women and pamper them with all the proper pleasantries. If you dance with him, he'll really dish out the flattery.", "Don't know how to dance? Say it isn't so! Mister Bernard can teach you; in fact, he spent most of his time teaching people how to move rhythmically at a recent engagement party, which was right nice of him.", "Not only does he ask unsuspecting women to dance, but Mister Kolgrim also pays attention to them throughout their time together, engaging in conversation and treating them nicely.", "Mister Ramsford arranged a public event and invited all of the town to celebrate his engagement. He provided food and drinks, music, and a good mood!", "That Mister Ice sure can overreact! He got angry in the commons talking about miss Prudence and said that he was going to cut her into pieces! Well, at least the Constabulary knows who to blame if something happens to the lass.", "I heard miss Prudence went into the brewery and starting goading a girl into a fight, calling her a whore, and mocking her clothes. Heh. Takes one to know one, what?", "More talk about miss Prudence trying to pick fights and making people leave where they're socializing to avoid issues. At least if she's gonna be trouble she could do something different from time to time.", "Handmaiden Inalla sent one of her gentrywomen a new, pretty fan, completely of her own accord. That's the kind of generosity that moves you up in the world.", "People don't seem to honor Dimache much anymore, but Admiral Flynn went and prayed like a devout follower of the Light should.", "The Mistress honored Dimache by praying in the chapel, like all devout followers of the Light should.", "Miss Naomi refused to pray in the chapel, panicked when she entered the holy building, and then fled before she said any prayers at all. Kinda makes you wonder, huh?", "Mister Jace honored Dimache by praying in the chapel, like all devout followers of the Light should.", "Miss Noire honored Dimache by praying in the chapel, like all devout followers of the Light should.", "Have you heard that Brie gives a discount for regular customers? I wish I could buy clothes often enough to be considered a regular.", "Do you know that the Rainbow Rags offer free clothes for new arrivals in the city? Yeah, if you meet a new person, just check the racks in the seamstress shop to find clothes for them. That Brie works hard to keep them stocked.", "I hear that Lady Grazia is quite pleased with how Xena stepped up to take care of the tournament and festival while she was away.", "You know, all the best people patron the arts. Xena is stepping up as well, commissioning a new statue for the city.", "Man, that Xena again. Standing up to Baronet Althalus, and taking him to task for assuming that the legal system should just automatically assume nobles are in the right. I know they trust nobles words more than ours, but I'm glad we're not instantly assumed to be guilty! Thanks to people like Xena fighting for the law. I bet she's glad she works for the Rinaldi, and not to Doloreaux about now.", "Did you hear that Esquire Lilandra first said that she didn't recognize her attacker? And now says it was Rankin? It seems to me that either she was told to say it was Rankin, or else she was too afraid in the first place to say who attacked her. Either way, I feel for the poor woman.", "Have you seen that muscular leopard around? Looking so fancy in his constabulary uniform? And now turning up to represent the constables. Now there's a man on the up-and-up.", "Have you heard what Sir Erwin said? He said he didn't care what trouble would come from going after Rankin, and he only cared about the safety of his house members. And that he'd accept whatever punishment that awards him. Now, that.", "Have you heard what Sir Erwin said? He said he didn't care what trouble would come from going after Rankin, and he only cared about the safety of his house members. And that he'd accept whatever punishment that awards him. Now, that's truly knightly behavior!", "Everyone heard about the meeting that Marcus organized. Getting all four houses and the constables together, and handling all the issues that came up. Move over, Don We've got a new Rinaldi diplomat!", "Brie tells me that Mister Rhys always pays bills on time. And here I was thinking that this city ran on debt...", "So, I walk into the boarding house lounge, and what do I see? A male rabbit. Sitting on top of some woman. Ugh! There are plenty of other chairs, or could have borrowed some from the severed tail if they'd run out.", "Did you hear? Esquire Katrina is sponsoring Xena? But only if she continues to hold the courtesy lectures. Smart move, Katrina. Now all the courtesy lectures are being held by the same group of people. The power! The control! What if they start telling everyone to wear pants on their heads? I bet it'd be the next fashion.", "Mister Ramsford is such a romantic! He got down on one knee when proposing to Brie. It's just like a fairytale!", "Need a wedding ring? Lidia's the girl for you!", "Does Taraji work for the church? I hear she's been giving money to the beggars.", "Mister Dylan helped gather healing supplies to aid the Doctors in treating people injured by the fire. Extra hands and extra helpers are always good.", "You hear that Virendra admitted that he was having affairs with \\"ladies\\", when he thought Maddy had run off on him? I know everyone has affairs, but you'd think that, for the sake of decency, he'd just lie and claim he was chaste.", "Sir Bayard is such a brave Knight! He charged right into the Severed Tail to assist with putting out the fire. No other Nobles were anywhere in sight.", "Enunciation is a good thing; unfortunately, miss Taraji only knows how to enunciate improper words like 'ass'. You shouldn't walk around calling people that, nope. It's the rudeness.", "Esquire Cerridwyn will make a fine wife. She shows proper modesty, or so I'm told. Not like all these commoner women.", "I hear that Brie is friends with some slaves, and offered to pay their masters to cover their work for the evening, so the slaves would be free to attend her engagement party.", "That Ofello Behr is one brave soul! I hear he ran straight into the blazing Severed Tail to aid Sir Bayard who was trying to put out the flames. See? You don't have to be part of a House to do the right and proper thing.", "What's that grizzly's name? Dylan? After the fire at the Severed Tail, he went running around gathering healing supplies for the Doctors while they were busy with all of the injured. I bet they really appreciated the extra help.", "Miss Nuit was out and about tending to the injured after the fire in the Severed Tail. I don't know if she's a healer or not, but it sure was swell of her to help out anyway.", "What is with Lions in this city? With one notable example, they seem to have no manners at all. Take that Akash, making comments at Miss Xena about how she's boring and he only likes her for her looks. And continually interrupting her because he's not paying attention during courtesy lessons. I wonder if lions know what the word \\"Ironic\\" means?", "Caliste is one polite slave! She even wrote a note to Dean Dylan apologizing for Ryan and Ramsford's behavior. I wonder if those two know she's apologizing for them, and I wonder what they'd think about it. Maybe they'd appreciate it, maybe they'd be annoyed, maybe Caliste sometimes forgets she's no longer gentry. But Dean Dylan seems happier now, so that's good.", "Doctor Jahren kept cozy in his line of work and helped tend to the injured after the fire in the Severed Tail was put out. Glad to know there was a trained medic on site.", "Seems lots of people appreciated miss Nuit helping out with the injured from the recent fire. It's so heart-warming to know the city is full of such caring and helpful people.", "Did you hear that Caliste managed to get Flynn to take a bath. I don't mean just washing his hears, but actually totally getting into the water. I wish more sailors had slaves that would make them bathe.", "Miss Opal was amongst the many helping tend to injured persons after the fire in the Severed Tail. Whew, sounds like patients had more than enough attention this time.", "Did you hear that Caliste managed to get Flynn to take a bath. What's more, Flynn then wore the clothes that Caliste had brought, and thanked her afterward. Being a yeoman has certainly improved his manners.", "That Mister Bernard managed to hurl a barrel of water at the fire in the Severed Tail when a team of people tried before him and couldn't manage. What a big help, and wow, those muscles!", "Doctor Jahren was really good about promptly seeing to the medical needs of people hurt in the Severed Tail fire. I guess that's why he's a doctor, eh?", "Talk about brisk! Miss Opal was flitting here and there, promptly seeing to the medical needs of people afflicted by the Severed Tail fire.", "That miss Noire ran and bought an overpriced barrel of water to put out the fire in the Severed Tail! I hope she knows that her generosity was appreciated and that the lives she helped save are priceless.", "Ryan was running back and forth gathering water to put out the Severed Tail fire with. It's a good thing bunnies are great and fast hoppers!", "Jahren is a true doctor, thinking on the future of the town. I hear he kept doses of spider itch cures, so when Flynn obtained it, the cure was at hand before the plague got out of hand again.", "Surely you've seen that Prudence female milling about. I hear she recieved a brand-spanking-new outfit from Miss Brie, and how was she repayed? With a scroll saying she forgot the stockings! How rude is that?", "Ryan risked his life trying to help extinguish the fire raging in the Severed Tail. He might just be a serf, but it still takes bravery to act like he did.", "A married man should mind his reputation, and bring no shame to his wife. Allowing women to kiss his jaw in public is certainly not the way to go about it.", "Aun unmarried woman should mind her reputation. Kissing married men, such as Flynn, on their jaw in public is certainly not the way to go about it.", "Mister Bernard was amonst the many who risked his life trying to help put out the fire in the Severed Tail. I bet all the people sleeping cozily in their rooms are thanking him as much as the people who saw him in action are!", "Mister Ramsford risked his life trying to help extinguish the fire that raged through the Severed Tail. It looks like hiim and many others will get to see another day thanks to his bravery!", "One of the ways not to woo a woman is to tell her that you have a friend that smells worse than she does. Someone should tell that to Kolgrim.", "Mister Leif gallantly offered to escort Dame Valara of the Avoirdupois about town to ensure her safety. Now that's a good and proper guard.", "I hear mister Bruno let mister Ofello take over his guild and either didn't bother to mention that certain members were being trained, or actively supported removing the ability of certain members to better their craft. Either way, that doesn't seem like good business, taking away people's means of progressing in their field after they have committed themselves to working for you.", "What sort of gentleman purposefully insults an Avoirdupois Knight? And if that wasn't the worse part, when a Doloreaux suggested he apologize, Sattar gave the stink-eye to Sir Brooks and claims to owe him no apology.", "Mister Ofello apparently took over the Hands of St. Trahern and his first order of business was to completely cut out pay and the ability to train with the teachers. He didn't even send out courtesy notes to his members to inform them of what was going on! People are starting to whisper that the guild is just using them to bring in money without offering any benefits. Oh my, that doesn't bode well.", "That Miss Brie is the role model of all young ladies in the city. If everyone valued their relationships and their partner as much as she does, the world would be a perfect place.", "Any new arrivals needing help adjusting to city life don't have a thing to worry about, with Caliste on the job. The best part is, she will be discreet about it.", "People are starting to believe Ice is insane. He giggles randomly in important conversations, wanders around aimlessly .. oh! And he claims to work for the church, while also being an ex-assassin who likes to self-admittedly bed men. Is it just me, or does it sound like the church will hire just about anyone these days?", "A small group of people were talking about a church member who had been acting sinful and insane. Miss Tomoe simply got up and walked out of the conversation without a concern at all about the church, a fellow church member, or preserving the ideals of S'allumer. This is supposedly a woman who works for the Faith! The nerve!", "Did you go to Miss Brie's and Mister Ramsford's engagement party? Neither did I, but I heard it was a hoot. There were free food and drinks, music, and a friendly atmosphere.", "That Sir Brooks is something else, in a good way! Sheriff Joshua was stressing out a bit about his upcoming promotion ceremony, and the Avoirdupois Knight sat all evening in the lounge helping him write up a speech. That's such a selfless sacrifice of precious time.", "What an engagement party that was! Not only was there an elaborate selection of food and drinks, it was open to the town and there was an opportunity to dance the night away!", "Even after mister Luciano insulted Esquire Katrina and got off with a warning, he contined to insult Sir Erwin and Sir Brooks, and even assaulted mister Veritas and miss Irene. There is just no end to this man's recklessness and poor behavior!", "The engagement party miss Brie and mister Ramsford held was jolly good fun! There was dancing, food--REALLY good food, drinks, and a lot of socializing! And they didn't even make it invite-only, everyone was encouraged to join! How generous of them!", "Esquire Katrina is so patient. She'll wait for the attention of freeman who have other things to do than tend to her, and she'll do it without complaint!", "Did you hear that if miss Xena really likes you, she'll give you a sound smack? I hope she doesn't start liking me anytime soon!", "That Caliste slave really is something special! She risked her life trying to help put out the fire in the Severed Tail, then even stayed behind to clean the place up!", "Bunnies aren't the only ones that can bounce around when on a mission. Caliste dashed to and from the Severed Tail, ferrying water in to help put out the blaze. Aren't we all lucky to have such useful slaves around?", "Did you hear about when Veritas stepped up and defended a woman Luciano was harassing and making lewd comments to? It's a good thing there are still a few decent men around.", "Can you believe Mister Cullan covered up for his housemate Gentleman Sattar and apologized for any offenses he may have caused? If you ask me, Gentleman Sattar is really lucky there are some in his House that are willing to pick up his slack. If I were Cullan, I wouldn't have bothered.", "That Luciano is up to no good as usual. I heard he found a group of people in the brewery patio, one of them being Sir Brooks, and said aloud that the Avoirdupois need to take the stools out of their.. rears. How tasteless!", "The slaves under Doctor Hush's ownership have it good. To celebrate Ryan's promotion to serfdom, Hush and Sir Brooks gave him enough money to buy everyone drinks, then they said toasts and offered kind words of praise for all his hard work and efforts. It's no wonder Ryan is behaving better with owners like that.", "Mister Ramsford is very inclusive with people, even if they've take offense to something he's said in the past.", "I heard that despite her close relationship with Chinco, that she testified against him on his charge. Smart of her to go with Lord Marcus on that one, appropriate too.", "Not only was she rude enough to eavesdrop on other peoples' conversations, Tomoe shows absolutely no initiative whatsoever in resolving problems. It's little wonder the people are starting to lose faith in the city clergy.", "That Prudence woman must be dying for attention, going around touching men without permission, then continuing to do so even after being told to stop. Just what is her problem?", "Did you hear that Brenner hosted his own courtesy class? Only unlike Xena's, it was about courteous dueling, which isn't something the general populace appears to be educated in. At least he is stepping up and doing something productive and beneficial to the city.", "I heard Ofello and Bruno Smith donated a heap of weapons, armors and shields to the Rinaldi to thank them for their hospitality and alliance with their guild. How generous of the two of them.", "I heard Bruno Smith and Ofello donated a heap of weapons, armors and shields to the Rinaldi to thank them for their hospitality and alliance with their guild. How generous of the two of them.", "That Ice sure has a filthy mouth! He threatened to cut Prudence to pieces, only referring to Prudence as.. well.. a really horrible name. Use your imagination!", "Miss Lianaar is incredibly thoughtful! While everyone else brought gifts only for the bride-to-be at Brie and Ramsford's engagement party, she was the only one who gave them a gift as a couple. And if that wasn't enough, she gave an entire speech dedicated to wishing them well in their future. How great is she!", "Cincin came bearing gifts to Brie and Ramsford's engagement party, but these gifts had meaning behind them. Couldn't tell you what they were, I didn't ask. She also gave them wise advice to follow while going into marriage.", "Isn't the purpose of Xena's courtesy classes to learn how to be courteous? That's what I thought, so why would someone attend and purposefully be rude? Someone should ask that Vincent fellow.", "I heard Ramsford attended Xena's courtesy lesson for the first time, the one about business and such, I think. He asked questions and involved himself in the discussion, which was very beneficial to the rest in attendance. I'm glad more and more people are feeling humble enough to accept improvement.", "A supposed man of the light, mister Gizzard walked through a courtesy gathering and said Light keep you safe, heaven knows you all need it. Religion is hard enough without people being so passingly judgmental.", "Did you hear? Admiral Flynn went crazy at Xena's courtesy meeting! Well, crazy may be stretching it, but he kept focusing on things that weren't there, then exclaiming that he was going to kill someone. In his defense though, one of the merchants told me something might have been slipped into his drink.", "Serfdom doesn't appear to be going to Ryan's head! You should have seen him, like a lightning bolt, carrying water to the Severed Tail to help put out the fire. Still as dutiful as he was when he was a slave.", "Have you heard of Mac? He valiantly assisted in the extinguishing of the fire in the Severed Tail! He sure made the Doloreaux look good with that, methinks.", "Ofello isn't just good for smithing weapons. You can count on him if another fire breaks out to jump in and lend a hand.", "Did you hear that the Spider Itch reared its ugly head again? But don't worry, it was swiftly dealt with. Ryan applied it to Admiral Flynn to cure him, risking getting infected himself. What a good example of self-sacrifice!", "Bad attitude or not, at least Vincent showed up to the courtesy lecture, which is more than what many others do. Whether or not he learned anything, though, is still unknown.", "Ryan treated Admiral Flynn for the spider itch at risk to himself. Awwz, what a good brother he is.", "Seen Noire at the courtesy lectures. She's quite the lady.", "Admiral Flynn selflessly refused medical care for himself until after the fire in the Severed Tail was safely put out. Lets just hope nobody got spider itch whie he was waiting for treatment.", "Admiral Flynn does a great job keeping all the slaves under his charge in line and well disciplined. At the same time he is very forgiving and reasonable when dealing with unruly slaves who are really apologetic. Hopefully he doesn't get too soft though, don't want the slaves thinking they can get away with everything.", "Did you hear that Admiral Flynn refused medical care until the fire was put out? I guess it comes from being a sailor, where a fire onboard threatens everyone.", "You heard that slave, Ryan, talk about his mother? With the most foul language! I'm sure it's true, but still... trust a slave to say it out loud.", "Xena is being promoted, but why is she going to the Bisclavret for a sponsor? Don't the Rinaldi have anyone appropriate?", "You know how Zoe is always punctual with her carpentry work? I hear on the odd occasions when she's running late she also gives discounts.", "I'm told that Cullan is helpful to nobles. But I have no idea what he does for them...", "Zoe helped donate items for the upcoming auction. What item? Attend the auction and see!", "Only nodding to gentry and even knights? Yeah, that's not really polite. But Chesh is just a freedman, so I don't think anyone cares too much, heaps of freedmen don't bother bowing. Even if they should. At least Chesh nodded to them.", "You heard about Chesh just nodding to knights? Yeah, I know, nobody really expects different since Chesh is just a freedman. But Veritas? Sometimes he barely even nods. Why should we care about Veritas and not Chesh? I guess we shouldn't, but I hear that he's going to get promoted soon. Maybe he'll start being more formal when he's a yeoman.", "I hear that even other slaves are complaining about Eldro, how he never helps clean the trash and how his mistress always coddles him. Ha! At least now the slaves are bitching about someone other than Marcel.", "Heard about Prudence... uh... propositioning men in public? Isn't it normally the men propositioning the women? At least, that's how it should be if you ask me!", "Isn't it nice when new arrivals to the city make an effort to earn what they are given? This one guy named Kildarien was actually mugged on his way to town, but instead of being mopey about his bad luck and accepting freebies, helped Ramsford run errands in exchange for coin.", "That mister Cullan is not only a dutiful and proper member of the Bisclavret, he is quite the gentleman! In addition to checking in with Countess Aedina to make sure she is well and not in need of anything, he offered to heft a heavy instrument around for her. How nice!", "Ryan is really helpful, if you have questions regarding promotions. Why, just the other day, he was coaching Caliste on how to handle promotions, going so far as to suggest names for potential sponsors. Does that mean Caliste is going to get promoted soon? It's almost a shame, she is such a good slave.", "That Leif needs to keep his private and public lives separate! No one wants to watch him display intimacy with his woman, has he no shame?", "You'd think that with the recent promotion to yeoman, Doctor Hush would display a little more taste when out in public and discussing business with others. She just up and allowed Leif to lick her ear, it's outrageous!", "Did you see what Leif did, right in the middle of the commons? He licked Doctor Hush's ear while she was in a conversation with someone! Not only is that rude, it's gross!", "I heard from a sailor that he saw Leif licking Doctor Hush's ear, right in public, while she was engaged in business with someone. Not only that, she didn't even bother to correct him UNTIL she saw the negative reaction it got. She is going to have to step it up, now that she isn't a commoner anymore.", "At least Doctor Hush had the sense to reprimand Leif for his display of unacceptable public affection.", "I heard from the milk maid who heard from the baker who heard from a passing merchant that when Hush reprimanded Leif for his behavior, she only did it to appease the other people present, and that Leif just smirked at her. At least she did something about it, but she is going to have to keep him in line.", "Did you hear? Miss Opal did a real good job taking care of those victims from the fire in the Severed Tail. Her initiative is commendable, what with her being new to healing and all.", "Mister Chinco went to church just to let everyone know he's capable of beating up S'allumer, and is just waiting for him to show his face. If S'allumer brought on a fight, I have a feeling it would be more along the lines of wiping someone out of existence rather than playing swords. Going into a holy building to talk trash is just unacceptable behavior, no matter how ridiculous the statement mister Chinco made was.", "Chinco, Chinco, Chinco. He encouraged people to attend mass by telling them to get in the damn church, and then made comments implying holy areas should be desecrated. If that wasn't enough disrespect, he stuck around for all of Mistress Meepers' prayer service, being generally disruptive and rude.", "Mister Ramsford was helpful in organizing and advertising Mistress Meepers' prayer service, and politely reminded people to attend on her behalf. What a good go-to boy he is.", "Mistress Meepers took time out of her busy schedule and trekked all the way to the Newtown arena to inform the Bisclavret nobles and a few others that she was holding a prayer service for the people who were victims of, and fought against, the fire in the Severed Tail. Being thoughtful really can take you places.", "Sir Bayard risked his health as a Noble to save the Severed Tail and its guests during a recent fire. He was badly injured during the process, but continued with extinguishing efforts regardless. Now that's behavior representative of a Knight.", "Sir Bayard bravely fought the fire in the Inn, sustaining burn injuries from his efforts. Acting selflessly really has got him a lot of recognition lately.", "When Meepers organized a prayer meeting for victims and fighters of the recent fire, mister Ramsford went out of his way to go around town announcing the event, and even put up a public notice for her. Sharing information is a great way to get recognized.", "Mistress Meepers took initiative and organized a prayer meeting for those injured in the fire. I'm sure the church folk will agree it was very pious of her to do so.", "Did you know Meepers organized a prayer meeting? If you didn't, where have you been?! She went to a lot of trouble to personally invite people and have it be a noteworthy event to thank those who fought the fire in the Severed Tail, and those who suffered from it.", "Meepers is being recognized all over for her recent prayer session honoring those who fought the Inn's fire, and sending warm wishes to the injured. I just don't even know how much more I can say about it, to be honest.", "Mister Teros and mister Ice were spotted kissing each other in the Docktown park area, and they're both men! How utterly inappropriate for a public place.", "Doctor Hush might have allowed Leif to cozy up to her in the commons at first, but she swiftly realized it was making people uncomfortable, and followingly told Leif to stop engaging in such inappropriate behavior. Time and place is everything; I'm glad she came to see that, too.", "I heard mister Leif was expressing bodily affection to Doctor Hush in the commons. Even if they're courting, that's just unacceptable behavior in a public area. He needs to think about how his actions reflect upon her too.", "That Kildarien fellow is really thoughtful! Why, I heard he took a full meal to Veritas, who was very busy all day. At this rate, he is going to put a lot of wives out of work!", "You know, brides-to-be can go really nuts. I hear Dahlia was in tears about the wedding preparations, so Brie offered to take them over. Which Dahlia agreed to, but then two days before the wedding Dahlia started making her own plans, and ignoring the work Brie had done. I tell you, those brides, they be crazy! Best to just avoid them entirely until the day of the wedding.", "I thought Baronet Althalus supported the Constabulary? Maybe not. He recently questioned Sheriff Joshua when getting arrested, demanding to see documentation on the arrest procedure. That's not the best way to get brownie points.", "Seems Sheriff Joshua has been getting a little rough recently while arresting Nobility. Baronet Althalus claims he was treated like a common ruffian by the Sheriff, despite the assurance that he wouldn't present any problems to the Constabulary officer. I guess the Baronet was hoping to go cuff free and get some special treatment due to his rank.", "Miss Prudence has been acting like a whore again in public, and followingly gets aggressive when people make a verbal note of her behavior. If you don't want people to see you for what you are, then perhaps some different behavior is appropriate when in crowds.", "That miss Danae sure is doing a good job of taking initiative and organizing the citizen's militia. I bet the number of complaints about available Constabulary members dwindles with the extra hands around to help out.", "Bayard is doing his part in supporting the Constabulary by joining the citizen's militia, so that any actions he takes to defend his House are legal. I heard he was incredly patient in exercising his newfound power when arresting mister Chinco, too.", "Despite having had multiple opportunies, mister Bayard still hasn't acknowledged mister Veritas' help in carrying him to the infirmary following his heart attack. Whether or not you get along with someone, it's generally polite to thank them when they have aided in saving your life, especially when you have previously gone out of your way to damage said person's reputation and standing and they helped regardless.", "Scandalous! Miss Dahlia was seen entering her private room alone with a man who wasn't her husband, and she didn't even acknowledge the Nobility she passed by while in this other man's company. Hasn't she only been married like a day?", "I heard miss Brie arranged for the Rinaldi to rent out the College in Newtown for miss Dahlia's wedding reception, and a day before the wedding Dahlia informed her that she had found some place else to hold the festivities, putting miss Brie in a very bad spot with the Rinaldi. I can't imagine being so inconsiderate to a guild mate.", "That slave Sigfried is really good about asking people if they need anything when he's around. Just the other day he went and grabbed a multitude of beers at the request of some people in the commons and promptly and properly handed them out. Uncomplaining and eager to serve, that's the kind of slave everyone wants.", "Mister Jace sent the slave Sigfried on an errand to get beer for everyone in the commons, and then let the slave have one too as a reward. That's the way to make slaves feel useful and appreciated.", "Despite being an owned slave, Sigfried is very helpful and obedient to anyone above his station. He'll serve drinks or do anything that doesn't go against the rules of his master, and is ever kind, polite, and proper without questioning people about the tasks given to him.", "Mister Bayard risked life and limb alongside the commoners when putting out the fire in the Severed Tail, even aiding so much as to take serious injury. Despite this, he refused treatment until all other wounded were tended to. His fortitude and dedication should be an example to all following an officer's path.", "How valorous it was of mister Bayard to charge at the fire in the Severed Tail with no regard for his own safety.", "That miss Prudence certainly has some audacity. I hear she threw wine in Mistress Pru's face when the carpenter tried to escort her from the wedding reception she wasn't invited to.", "Miss Prudence decided to waltz in on a wedding reception and be rude to the guests, and even ruder to the bride and groom! Who is going to teach this girl some manners?", "People are still boggling over miss Prudence having thrown wine in mistress Pru's face. I bet the pretty Pruessus was just livid!", "When the groom of a wedding asks you to leave a reception you weren't initially invited to, you should go. Apparently miss Prudence is unaware of the discourtesy she showed by refusing to leave mister Dune's wedding party when he requested it.", "Showing up uninvited to a party is rude. Refusing to leave a party when asked is even worse than rude, and being mean and hateful is just not appropriate regardless of where you are. Miss Prudence managed to do all these things in one day without even blinking.", "Miss Prudence showed up at miss Dahlia and mister Dune's wedding reception uninvited. When asked to leave, she refused and continued to partake in refreshments that were meant for the guests stating that the park wasn't owned by the couple and their party occupying it. Why would you try to ruin someone's wedding day, honestly?", "Mistress Meepers helpfully assisted miss Danae with an investigation into the possible arson attack on the Severed Tail. I hear she gave a list of witnesses, and a variety of leads for the Constabulary member to pursue. Cooperating with the law is a sure way to get recognized in this city; the Mistress has the right idea.", "Miss Danae has been busy investigating and diligently pursuing whomever potentially set the fire in the Severed Tail. People are commending her for her efforts.", "After Doctor Hush chided mister Leif for licking her ear in public, she turned around and started licking his jaw in the commons! Gah .. don't these people learn anything?", "Doctor Jahren did a fantastic job of tending to the injured after the Severed Tail fire. Mister Bayard even commented he would make him his personal physician if he wasn't so valuable an asset to the city as a whole. Ahh, to have good medical care is invaluable.", "Mister Bayard got harmed attempting to fight a fire in the Severed Tail. If putting himself in harm's way to protect others isn't a virtue worth commending, I don't know what is.", "Esquire Aysun is a pillar of fashion, always being nicely dressed with an orderly appearance, and displaying appropriate manners  to match.", "I hear mister Veritas gifted Countess Aedina with a unique harp recently, and distracted her from being upset over incidents regarding her house. Buying the favor of a Noble with material goods, ahh, the sweetness of it.", "Did you hear? Esquire Aysun went into a private room... with a chaperone. It shouldn't be amazing, but so few people take a chaperone with them when they are going to be in private with a member of the opposite sex. Remember, You and Me and Chaperone makes Three.", "I hear that Miss Xena is willing to chaperone when people of rank will be in private together. She's certainly got the social respect to be a good chaperone.", "I heard from my friend's cousin who heard from her husband who works as a butler with the Bisclavret that Lord Twyrch hates doing paperwork, and Esquire Aysun picks up the slack. I still don't reckon nobles work nearly as hard as us commoners. How can they when they spend all their time gossiping instead of working. Speaking of which, that reminds me about this story I have to tell... you'll never believe what the Rinaldi chambermaid told the chimney sweep...", "Have you seen the new furniture that Esquire Aysun has been given? A gift for Lord Twyrch to recognize her hard work.", "Is Yeoman Veritas now working for the Avoirdupois? I hear he's been going into private rooms with their slave.", "Need a dummy to beat on? Kildarien will gladly volunteer his own body for spars if you have students to teach combat techniques to.", "That Esquire Katrina sure is a S'allumer loyalist. Apparently she wants the Inquisition to be more forceful, and to make public examples of those who spurn the Light. I bet Presbyter Ximen is just giddy with that encouragement .. frightening!", "Having a party, but don't want to clean up the mess afterward? Hire on mister Fyros. I hear even if you leave goods of value behind he'll return them without a second thought.", "Despite all of Esquire Aysun's duties, she still sets aside time to pray on Dimache like a good follower of S'allumer should. It's no wonder the Light has showered her with so many blessings.", "That carpenter squirrel, Irene? Shes been giving a lot of gracious discounts lately to people on furnishings so they can spruce up their homes. A whole room for twenty denarii? Psh. Sign me up.", "The Rinaldi's newly inducted miss Lianaar has agreed to serve as a mediator between the Doloreaux and Constabulary. She has been gentle and understanding with the Doloreaux embassy and is giving them sound advice on how to kiss and make up with the law guild. That's the sort of person every house should be looking to employ.", "Esquire Katrina hasn't given up on soothing bad feelings between the Doloreaux and the Constabulary. She's being proactive and cooperative with the Rinaldi trying to clear out the air on behalf of her embassy.", "Mister Rhys has embraced the spirit of giving, turning over a new violin to the University for it's music students.", "Miss Shade isn't very discrete about her entertaining of men. She was hanging all over Caelith in the commons the other day and then stepped out into the boarding house lounge where he passed through a few moments later and led her toward the guest hall. It doesn't take a genius to fit the pieces together.", "That miss Minni is ridiculously bold in her promiscuous propositioning of men. They have a cathouse for people interested in that kind of work, don't they? Someone needs to give her directions.", "Esquire Katrina sure does promise a lot of things: contracts regarding meteors, courtesy lectures and church sermons. Have you noticed she rarely follows through on those promises? Yah, even her courtesy sessions only lasted for a few bouts, and that doesn't even require organization with anyone but herself. Gentry people should know better than to make promises they cannot keep since their word is worth more than the word of many.", "Mister Grimclaw always acts with discipline and professionalism when carrying out his duties as Veritas' Lieutenant. If you need a soldierly sort, maybe you can see if he can be hired out?", "Miss Taraji proved she can follow orders from her commanding officers and act with discipline during one of the Sentinel's recent contracts. Despite that she lacks extensive formal training as a soldier, she still gives 100%.", "However rough around the edges some might call Mister Rhys, he is quite the gentleman.

Her hard work definitely deserves some recognition.", "Azrael is good at testing blah blah blahs too!", "If you're going to be a criminal, at least don't be a pest. Mister Chinco recently wasted the Constabulary's time after being arrested by walking slowly, generally stalling, and being irritating. If you're gonna do the crime, be prepared to walk swiftly to your fate. The lawpeople don't like stragglers.", "Mister Mac is doing his civic duty and has joined the citizen's militia. What a good choice for a house guard to make.", "Mister Cullan has decided to join the citizen's militia on behalf of the Bisclavret Embassy. What a good guy, doing his civic duty.", "Miss Taraji apparently gave her jewelry to a parrot named Belle. Even though it was an act of somewhat unwilling kindness, she could have reacted far worse to it. She did a good job of maintaining her composure while the bird snatched her things.", "Miss Lianaar offered to mediate between Sheriff Joshua and Baronet Althalus with their current disagreement, appearing impartial and listening and understanding concerns on both sides. I hear she's a woman very conscious of propriety too, rising when her superiors do, and waiting to sit until they sit. What an asset she is to the city, aiding in such capacities.", "Mister Rhys comported himself professionally and controlled his soldiers well during an outing to parley with Seaweed Joe. Others in attendance were appreciative of his leadership abilities.", "Lord Marucs sure is an understanding Noble. He listened to Baronet Althalus' concerns regarding the Sheriff and attempted to assist in finding a resolution for everyone without impuning on anybody's honor. Tact and delicacy are fantastic traits in a leader, and are definitely useful tools in diplomacy.", "Did you hear? Ryan has been helping Doctor Hush's new students by proffering himself as a patient to be practiced on. People are even saying he got his finger dislocated for the sake of education. Wow, what a dedicated and obedient person he's turned into since serfdom.", "Did you notice Ryan gets a little jealous when his master, Doctor Hush, gives attention to soemone else? To retaliate he tries to act fond of different people too, but unfortunately he forgets to think about whether they might get into trouble or not.", "Even after being warned about mister Ice and his aggressive attempts to kiss other men, mister Zev was seen going into a private room with him. I guess warnings don't mean anything to some people, or maybe he just isn't worried about Ice's romantic inclinations. It isn't terribly inappropriate for people of the same gender to be in rooms together, but his judgement is still questionable.", "Not only did Virendra cheat on his wife after swearing to be faithful this time, but when his wife found out and left him, he went and found the lass he slept with and beat her half to death for sleeping with a married man. It's a shame we dont have a place for the crazies in Triskellian..", "Meepers sure is unorganized. One of her customers came complaining that she crammed all their new clothing into a package without separating one outfit from another, leaving them with what looked like a colorful load of laundry.", "Mister Styre and miss Elizabeth have been seen entering private rooms together, and both have declined the offer of a chaperone.

Think, think, think.", "Ryan has been engaging in random acts of kindness, giving some of his own clothes to a recent newcomer in Triskellian.", "Boy, that Ryan! He was generous enough to give a newcomer some brand new clothes. Doctor Hush sure must be a good master, raising her slave to act so nicely.", "How many times do people need to be chided for fighting in public areas? Mister Virendra caused a scuffle in the infirmary, and refused to leave until after the guards gave him a good kick in the behind.", "How rude! Mister Ice was heard saying he wants to slaughter miss Prudence. Even if you feel that way, you shouldn't talk about it in public. Slaughter isn't a polite word.", "Mister Ekalah saw some fighting in the commons and as a way to show disapproval refused to make a dagger for one of the people involved in the scuffle. I guess at least they still have their fists to hurt each other with.", "Talk about adding insult to injury. After miss Madalina beat up miss Prudence in a fight, she followingly struck her across the face! Women sure can be brutal..", "Baronet Althalus is back to insulting the Sheriff.

I hear she politely parted company from a scene where the Baronet was being rude because she couldn't suffer sitting by while the Doloreaux Noble flung commands and insults at the Constabulary leader. What a true Rinaldi.", "Even if you're a Noble, you don't really have the right to insult other Nobles. Baronet Althalus has gone back on the warpath against the Constabulary, telling Sheriff Joshua to shut his mouth or take his leave if he doesn't have anything useful to contribute to conversations. Way to set an example for his house, eh? And think of that poor Katrina who has worked so hard trying to smooth things over from the last incident.", "Insulting the Sheriff in front of others? Too bad for Baronet Althalus people aren't comprehending his issues with the law anymore, nor are they appreciating his commanding a fellow Noble to leave the room or shut his mouth. He might think the world revolves around him, but if he continues being rude and nasty he's headed for a wake up call.", "The Sheriff politely dealt with Baronet Althalus despite the Doloreaux Noble being very rude to him, telling him to shut his mouth or take his leave. He even bowed and stuff after being so insulted! I would have given that boar the what for, I tell you, but I guess that's why I'm a humble gossiper.", "Sir Brooks sided with Sheriff Joshua, and left a meeting after Baronet Althalus once again insulted the Constabulary member. They say there is power in numbers; how many people are on the side of the Doloreaux?", "Mistress Meepers supported Sheriff Joshua by leaving a meeting after Baronet Althalus again insulted the Constabulary. It's nice to see the Rinaldi keeping its loyalty to local law enforcers.", "For shame! Telling the Shriff to shut his mouth or leave a meeting. That's exactly what Baronet Althalus did, to a Knight no less. How can Nobles expect commoners to respect them when they can't even respect each other?", "Despite Sir Erwin knowing that Sir Brooks is a Noble, and confirming his knowledge of it, he didn't rise to bow to the Avoirdupois Knight when he entered a meeting, and never addressed him properly during the course of said meeting either. It's rude for Nobles to not acknowledge one another, especially if one of them is showing due respect.", "Miss Prudence fought with a pregnant woman in the middle of the commons. Not only did she fight with someone in that condition, but she lost! How embarrassing for her..", "Miss Prudence was brawling with miss Madalina in the middle of the commons with a full group of people around no less! How unsafe, and isn't that Madalina pregnant? I wonder what the condition of her baby is with all this fighting going on.", "Miss Madalina was brawling with miss Prudence in the middle of the commons with a full group of people around no less! How unsafe, and isn't that Madalina pregnant? I wonder what the condition of her baby is with all this fighting going on.", "While her husband did cheat on her, and she is pregnant, miss Madalina took it to a whole new level making a public spectacle out of the occurrence. If my significant other cheated on me, I surely wouldn't want everyone and their uncle knowing. How embarrassing.", "Mister Virendra has once again cheated on his pregnant wife, and was even obvious enough to get caught and let news of it seep out to the public. Why did he ever get married at all if he can't respect his vows?", "Did you know mister Virendra is actually still available? That's what the scroll his mistress sent to his wife said. Yep, and that's why she gave him good lovings. You'd think people would notice that pregnant woman he's married to at some point, but maybe he's with so many different women nobody really knows who he's actually taken vows to.", "The Doloreaux aren't very happy about Sheriff Joshua doing his duty and handcuffing Baronet Althalus in public. I think they would have preferred more discretion, but the law treats criminals the same regardless of rank. I bet it would have been handled more politely if there wasn't so much friction going on between the Doloreaux and the Constabulary right now. Jeesh, I'm glad I'm not a part of either of those organizations.", "Lady Theressa was said to be in the commons speaking only in her native Eastern tongue and looking amused when the commoners had no idea what she was asking. Maybe she assumes the language is the default tongue of everyone? I don't know, but it's pretty disrespectful to the culture of others, and really strange that she seemed offended when nobody responded to her questions.", "Sir Erwin was kind enough to act as Lady Theressa's translator to ease conversation with the common folk of the city. Apparently she has forgotten to speak Calabrese during her time away.", "Things are all good between Doctor Hush and the Doloreaux now. I hear she's even aiding them in speaking their case amongst the guilds and assisting in convicting the street rat Rankin for his crimes.", "That Taraji sure is a respectable and loyal employee. She not only turned down the promise of more pay to work for miss Prudence as bouncer at the Maison, but went and told her employer of the offer so no rumors would start that weren't already explained. Smart idea, especially considering how nasty rumors surrounding the Maison can be.", "Miss Prudence is trying to snatch away employees of guilds now, falsely promising them more pay to be bouncers in the Maison.

After the insult, she even punched miss Lidia in the face! A brawling prostitute .. just what the city needs.", "I hear miss Lidia was in the commons the other day wearing practically nothing. Prudence plucked at Lidia's camisole and called her a vulgar name, at which point Lidia slapped Prudence in the face and mentioned something about her being 'diseased'. It's no wonder miss Prudence is constantly picking fights! These people rise to the occasion, I tell you.", "Despite mistress Meepers still having to fight against unfair biases due to her past, she is doing her beset to quell rumors by being honest and understanding, and has gone back to praying in the chapel for those who speak ill against her and her friends. That's proof that anyone and everyone can find strength in the Light. Good for her.", "That fox with the yellow rose in her hair? That's Tatiana. I hear she was looking distraught and Virendra asked if she was alright, you know, out of the goodness of his heart, and she just responded with drastic accusations .. none of which could be true, naturally. Sure is rude to judge someone you don't know, even if you know them by listening to the rumors.", "If you plan on going out shark hunting, make sure to drag Meepers with you. I hear she can prepare shark skin like it ain't nobody's business.", "Insulting a man and calling him criminal scum without knowing what he's done or if he has a history of being bad is just rude. That's what miss Tatiana did, and hey .. wait a tick. Ain't she new to town? You'd think she'd be wanting to make good impressions by showing that she has some manners.", "Who's a cute little wolf cub? Lennox is! That little'un is also so polite and respectful, saying please and thank you even when he doesn't need or have to. The Sheriff has schooled him right in manners.", "Lia sure does get involved in a lot of things that aren't her business, but have you seen her get involved in things that are her business? Not many people have. Cleaning the trash, for example, or other slave chores she's supposed to attend to. Maybe she's too good for the work befitting her station.", "Miss Iolanthe has started showing an interest in understanding local etiquette and courtesy expectations by attending some of the Docktown courtesy lectures. It's so great to see commoners working to better themselves!", "I hear miss Prudence called one of Clover's workers a whore. Doing that is like saying he hires whores! He may run gambling dens, he may do loans at usurious rates, but he definitely doesn't dabble in whores except as a rare customer. Them're the facts.", "Mister Rhys is currently supporting people who want to further their education by helping pay for schooling for those can't afford it, and by donating instruments for those inclined toward music. I'd be suspicious of someone so nice if it were me, but it ain't, so carry on.", "Bob told Sally who told Joe who told Esther who told someone else I can't remember the name of that Doctor Hush has been going into private rooms unchaperoned with mister Leif. Even if they are courting, playing in each other's bedrooms isn't courteous behavior.", "That Veritas is always holding chairs and doors for ladies, gentlewomen, and even female commoners. Some of these Knights around town need to take lessons from him, seriously.", "I hear that the slave Lia gives out free salves and herbal products to whores without asking for any kind of reimbursement. The employees of the Maison just think she's great for doing that. I'm not so sure how the gardeners feel though about losing out on coin.", "Miss Taraji has been vigilantly guarding the infirmary for Doctor Hush while a patient is in recovery. It's good to have someone capable loitering outside the door in case anyone tries to sneak in and assault anyone again.", "I heard Madalina went and hurt Minni in the infirmary while Minni was recovering from the beating Virendra had given to her earlier. Oh .. you don't know that story? Madalina is Virendra's pregnant wife, Minni slept with Virendra, Virendra sleeps with both of them, and both Virendra and his pregnant wife went to assault Minni since she is obviously the one causing issues. Yeah, I can't hardly keep up either.", "Sleeping around behind your wife's back might be somewhat acceptable to some people, but beating up on your mistress after your wife finds out you're cheating? If Virendra can't take the wrath of his wife, it might be a hint to stop sleeping around instead of encouragement to beat on defenseless women.", "Not only does miss Minni sleep around, but now she's sleeping around with married men like mister Virendra. What a homewrecker.", "Esquire Katrina may be decent at dealing with other Houses, but she can't seem to keep her own embassy members from acting inappropriately in public. As acting Ambassador and a supposed expert on courtesy and protocol, you'd expect her to have a stern talking to with mister Leif about his improper public displays of affection, but she hasn't. Perhaps being a stricter judge of character when it comes to who the people in her House can court would help? One thing's for sure, doing nothing in response to his activities is bringing shame to the Doloreaux.", "I heard from a sailor, who heard from a healer, who heard from someoneâ€™s wife that Hush lets Leif grab her inappropriately in public! When they were caught, they both denied anything was going on. I guess they were so wrapped up in each other, they forgot the crowd of people in the commons...", "Leif was all over Hush in the commons -again-. She should know better than to allow that, recently having been promoted to the rank of Yeoman. She doesn't even try to stop him in crowded areas, so it's no wonder he keeps doing it.", "I hear Leif is at it -again-, groping and kissing Doctor Hush in the commons. Honestly, is that what the Doloreaux consider appropriate courting procedure?", "Does anybody ever see Eldro doing anything work-wise? I don't, but someone happened to see him carrying 27 denarii around the other day. I thought slaves weren't supposed to have money as a general rule? Oh well, nobody seems to care what he does or doesn't do anyway.", "I hear Lia went and told the Sheriff about some creepy black magic business. What a brave thing to do, especially since the accused is known for being crazy!", "Disdainfully speaking about the Constabulary and how they like to 'waste their time handcuffing Nobles' is hardly a productive way for Baronet Althalus to mend his relationship with the city's law enforcers, or with the Rinaldi for that matter.", "Mistress Meepers recently injured her leg falling down the stairs in the boarding house, and Deputy Krell has been assisting her everywhere she needs to go. What a good Constable he is!", "A monkey heard from Naomi that Ryan told her she should work as a whore in the cat house. Even a serf should know better than to encourage his own daughter to be a whore!", "I hear Deputy Krell threatened to have miss Tatiana charged with insulting an officer for expressing her opinion on a bath satchel. What is the Constabulary coming to trying to make criminals out of people with fashion sense?", "Not only is he a capable Sheriff, Joshua is a sharp dresser, too, and he can perform well in his very best attire. You'd never know he only owns two pairs of boots unless I told you. Oh wait .. shoot.", "Mister Gothryd came out of the cathouse unabashedly talking to others about how relaxing the whores were. He even had the audacity to discuss the bull who had been in there before him. Even the Maison has etiquette, and disclosing who frequents it in a public forum just isn't appropriate conversation.", "I don't think mister Zander is a healer, but he took it upon himself to set Sang's nose when it got broken, even though it was spewing out blood everywhere. Talk about some atrocious volunteer work!", " Mister Jace has been giving free lessons to those who don't know how to swim. I bet the number of drownings start to decrease thanks to his generosity, or they increase, depending on how good of a teacher he is.", "Mister Rhys always honors the holy day of Dimache with several hours of prayer. Other people need to take a hint from his dedication and loyalty to religion.", "Serfdom has brought Ryan closer to religion. People are talking about how he has been spending Dimache praying in church. Thanking S'allumer for your blessings is a sure way to continue receiving them.", "Talk to S'allumer much? Ryan does, especially on Dimache. Just go to the church and you'll likely find him there honoring the Holy Day.", "Miss Taraji is following in her boss' footsteps, honoring Dimache with prayer and observation of the traditions of the Church.", "I heard Lia was giving Doctor Hush an attitude when the Doctor was trying to explain that giving away pastes and other supplies adversely affects other students, gardeners, and healers. There's a way to state your opinion without being offensive, but Lia obviously picks up her manners from her Doloreaux owners.", "How low the Doloreaux seem to have fallen lately. I was told that Esquire Katrina has been openly contributing funds to one of the many new streetwalkers in the city who is vying for renting space at the local brothel. How absolutely scandalous that a gentle woman would so freely support such an establishment.", "Doctor Hush has been writing on the public boards in favor of stepping up against black magic babies at the request of miss Cincin. It's nice to see the guilds stick together on some issues.", "I hear Mistress Meepers did a good job and helped miss Brie out with her auction due to Brie being injured. How nice that despite the two are both seamstresses they can still get along and not have everything turn into a competition.", "Miss Angeline was heard saying she wanted to see mister Sang naked after she'd only met him two minutes prior. How utterly improper, and doesn't she claim to not be a whore?", "Miss Schiacchitano is ever polite and proper when dealing with persons of rank. I hear she made a fine impression on mister Rhys, and even managed to impress Countess Aedina.", "Unsolicited, and out of sheer generosity, mister Rhys was said to have given two aureals to miss Tatiana to help her buy new clothing. He sure is sweet to the women, isn't he?", "Mister Virendra has been threatening people from behind bars! He told miss Tatiana she shouldn't chide or insult him for the crime he committed when he would be released shortly. I don't doubt him either, after what he did to miss Minni.", "Katrina is giving money to support the establishment of prostitutes in the city. That's terribly inappropriate for a woman of genteel nature, and especially one who prides herself on teaching etiquette and courtesy and supporting the ways of penitence.", "Know what you should do if a masked stranger asks to groom you? Smile and back away. Just ask Nayrienne.", "You know that Caliste? She made some food for a local event, but ended up making too much. But instead of throwing it out, she distributed it to a group of needy beggers. How thoughtful!", "That wolf seamstress, Dahlia, had a wedding not too long ago. I heard that she sent a bunch of refreshments out to her friends that weren't able to make her reception; even slices of the cake! Lucky!", "You remember that fire in the boarding house a while back? I heard from one of the Severed Tail maids that Caliste raced upstairs, heedless of the smoke and flames, to rouse people who would otherwise be burnt to a crisp! How brave!", "That Xena sure is becoming quite the diplomat! Not only did she arrange the parlay with the infamous Seaweed Joe, she also hired mercenaries to protect Lord Marcus, wrote up all the contracts, and handled all the negotiations.", "I heard Veritas accompanied the group who went to meet Seaweed Joe to protect Lord Marcus. He handled the company well and was very attentive.", "Despite being a commoner, Taraji can keep herself composed and proper among higher company. She is even good with creatures, like Seaweed Joe's parrot, whom she kept entertained during the meeting.", "You know that very quiet wolf, Grimclaw? He also attended the meeting with Captain Joe. He was very observant throughout, and lent his support to the Rinaldi, despite not being a member.", "Fyros attended the meeting with Captain Joe, despite not being offered any pay or compensation for his time, made the introductions, and stood to support the Rinaldi. Oh, and he helped keep the Captain's parrot occupied.", "Despite being in the presence of an infamous pirate, Lord Marcus handled himself responsibly and professionally at the meeting. He took care of most of the diplomat talking and assisted in arranging the parlay.", "Xena handled herself typically well during the parley, but most of all she made sure the deal struck was followed through, no matter how long it took. She has the patience of a saint.", "Xena is good about providing work for the small mercenary guards around town. She enlisted Veritas's guild, the Sentinels, to protect her and Lord Marcus during the meeting with Seaweed Joe.", "Veritas was accidentally overpaid by Lord Marcus for the work he and his guild did during the meeting with Seaweed Joe, but the guild leader promptly returned the extra amount. How honorable!", "He hosted a party for Beltane, explained what it was for, provided food and drinks, and included everyone in attendance. It was really fun.", "He provided music for Veritas's Beltane event, free of charge. It's hard to come by entertainers these days, so was good of him to come and liven up the festivities.", "He helped provide music for Veritas's Beltane event, without expecting any pay. With a shortage of good musicians in town, it was nice of him to offer his services.", "The festival of Beltane was a big success, and I heard Caliste helped prepare for it.", "The potted plants around the city sure are thriving. I saw Shade scurrying around town making sure they were pruned and watered.", "Xena chaperoned a meeting between Esquire Aysun and Lord Twyrch, and it's a good thing too, can you imagine the trouble that would stir up if anyone started any rumors between the two nobles?", "I heard Lord Twyrch crafted Esquire Aysun a literal smorgasbord of shiny new furniture for her hard work for the Embassy and for handling what no one else would. He also made sure she was being paid properly.", "She made a request of Xena to escort herself and Lord Twyrch up to the Esquire's room for a private meeting, so that no one would spread any nasty rumors. A very appropriate action.", "Esquire Katrina was kind enough to let her own courtesy lectures trail off while Xena held her own so there wouldn't be split groups. Apparently the whole thing was to see if Xena was deserving of sponsorship. How clever.", "You know that lioness, Xena? She does a real good job working for the Rinaldi. Capable of handling situations involving jewelry-crazed birds, hostile pirates and protecting her Nobles all at the same time. It's good to see a commoner represent the Rinaldi so well!", "Have you heard about Angeline? Apparently she went to the prominent seamstress, Brie, for a clothing order and introduced herself as a Mistress. When asked what kind of mistress she was, she refused to answer, then called Brie naive for practically no reason. How rude!", "You didn't hear this from me, but I think Caelith thinks his employer, Clover, is fat. He said something about Clover being exhausted, probably from climbing down his stairs. I don't want anything bad to happen to me, so I don't think Clover is fat..", "It's hard to believe that new arrivals in the city can be so respectful, engaging and polite, but that gorilla Gothryd is all three! He was also brave enough to accept monetary assistance to help him get started.", "You wouldn't believe what I saw! Cullan, who recently got married, was taking Inalla up to the guest rooms, and without an escort or anything! Scandalous!", "I saw Inalla go up into the guest rooms willingly with Cullan, a married man. And without an escort! Can you believe that? I wonder what Mistress Pru would think.", "That Prudence sure is a little tart! She was harassing Doctor Hush in the commons, right in front of everyone, calling her horrible names and accusing her of being a bad healer. And without any reason other than to be mean!", "That Prudence again.. she was even harassing Caliste just because she thought Caliste was wearing clothes too fancy for a slave. I think Prudence isn't wearing enough for being a commoner, in my opinion.", "Someone needs to whip that slave Eldro into shape. He doesn't do anything a slave is supposed to do, like cleaning the rash receptacles. I'll feel sorry for him when Faile finds out.", "I overheard that Prudence asking Veritas, in the middle of the commons no less, if he wanted to bed her! Ugh.. don't the local prostitutes have any sense of discretion?", "I don't know all the details, but I heard Madalina stormed over to the infirmary and attacked an injured woman, all because she can't control her husband. Who violates the safety of the infirmary like that?", "Caliste is so incredibly helpful to others, it makes my eyes hurt. She is always freely sharing her knowledge to anyone interested.", "Even though her own arm was mangled badly, Shade helped bandage Brie after being injured during the shark hunt. How caring!", "Did you know about Captain Fyros? He doesn't own his own ship, and instead rents them - but he does bring them back in one piece, which makes the ship owners happy.", "A fisherman and a captain, Fyros is also a waiter! At the auctions, he was fetching and carrying pie. Good to see a man who can make himself useful to his guild superior.", "The Dean of Arts? He crazy! But polite, stopping to help Brie when she was on crutches and had all that furniture to move.", "I hear Leif is saving his strength. While Brie was struggling on her crutches under all the furniture, Mr Leif pretended he didn't even see her and left her to sort things out on her own. But you just wait until Leif busts out his strength, he'll be so well rested that he'll punch right through a stone wall!", "Some tips for meeting new people. 1) Have a third person introduce you to them, if possible. Do the same for anyone you do that the stranger hasn't met. 2) Ask them thoughtful questions, like what they do for a living, or what noble house they support. 3) Avoid wrapping your tail around strangers. Even people who are courting shouldn't carry on like that in public. Asking them the thoughtful questions from step 2 while touching them just shows everyone else that you're fondling a stranger in public. Where are the constables, to file charges of disorderly conduct?", "That Brie, she's either really dedicated, or really greedy. Holding an auction, after nearly being eaten by a shark. Maybe Brie is dedicated, and the shark was greedy?", "That greedy shark, trying to eat Brie. Luckily, Meepers offered to help with the auction. Good on her.", "You don't want to be Brie's fiance. That shark attack, Mr Ramsford got hurt too. But then Brie sent him running all over town carrying packages for her auction. The poor man! Oh well, such is married life, and Mr Ramsford shows how a good husband should behave. Isn't that right, girls?", "Cursing and lecturing people about eating meat? Who does that serf think he is? And what does he expect, should wolves go on a salad diet? No no, I'm going to eat meat if I care to, and he's lucky I'm not an atavist, or I might consider some pot roasted rabbit.", "Kissy kissy kissy. I think Hush and Leif are joined at the mouth. I guess gossiping about them behind their backs wasn't enough for them to get the hint. Maybe we need to gossip louder. About HUSH and LEIF. Doing THAT THING TOGETHER... you know, KISSING. IN PUBLIC. AGAIN. Was that loud enough? Think they'll find a room next time?", "I heard Taraji was half-naked while swimming. Some people think that's bad, but I hear she isn't half bad looking. And I guess it's all fine. It's not like she was swimming naked, after all.", "I heard Opal was half-naked while swimming with Taraji. Phwoar, too bad I wasn't there. It's not like they were swimming naked, though.", "Unmarried? Flirting? Suggesting they would 'drag each other off'? Carrying her off in his arms? And on a Dimache!", "Unmarried? Flirting? Suggesting they would 'drag each other off'? Allowing herself to be carried off in his arms? And on a Dimache!", "What's this? Ximen was asked about courtship, and sent him to Xena? I know she handles courtesy lectures, but shouldn't a priest be able to give advice about the first steps leading to marriage? Isn't that one of the things priests do? Is Brother Ximen so full or fire and brimstone for the heretics that he's forgotten to guide the faithful?", "Taking an interest in politics, attending meetings, participating in contracts, and setting a good example? His superiors in the Sentinels are certainly noticing Jace's behavior!", "I've noticed Lysandus has been attending Sentinel meetings. Think he's bucking for a promotion?", "Have you heard of Lysandus? Better avoid him if you are a cat, unless you like being called kitty. But you haven't heard this from me.", "Docktown has a few rugged and crude people around. Some claim Lysandus is one of the more disrespectful types, but I never seen the man myself.", "When someone wanted to go and bath without a swimming suit, Opal ensured no such thing happens. She lent the suit for him so he can look for turtles. Smooth and proper, don't you think?", "You hear about that dog? Well, it seems his name is Lysandus and he clearly doesn't respect Nobility. He's been pretty rude in front of Dame Grazia. I wonder how the nobles and their guard will handle it.", "Cursing in the church? Loud enough for people outside to hear? Tsk, tsk. I wonder what brought Ryan to do so.", "You know what they say, if you can't handle people digging in your laundry, don't spread it in the commons, right? Maybe Madalina should stop cursing at people who explain to her why her daughter might be avoiding her.", "Zoe is a very popular and skilled carpenter. But maybe she still should answer all her scrolls and customers. Some seem to be quite upset about her lack of correspondence.", "So you have issues with manners and protocols? Veritas, I heard, is always ready to aid in the field, patiently and kindly explaining rules of courtesy.", "My my, some people just love to complain. If they don't have a satchel, that's the problem, if they have one, then that's the problem. Tatiana should have valued Deputy Krell running all around the town to get her a satchel when she complained about lacking one. Even if it didn't fit her attire. Careful what you wish for.", "Employees of Veritas claim he is one of the best employers people can have. Loyal to the people he employs, makes sure their needs are taken care of and paying fair wages. Not bad. Shouldn't all guild leaders be like this?", "Taraji's co-workers seem to be rather pleased about her helpful spirits and ability to mediate, when such need arises.", "S'allumer is the most important, right? Right! But some do not wish to learn of him! Lysandus picked whispering to a whore instead of learning of the light. Doesn't he know, S'allumer sees all?", "Bishop Basanti? She is quite actively seeking leadership when she is around. Did good with all the sermons, and the chapel was filled with followers. But I hear some feel low about her sudden leave. I hope she is all well? She didn't even have time to settle matters of the church, before she left, I heard.", "A devout follower of the light, Esquire DiDraco, or as others know her, Meepers. She is often seen in prayers on the hol.", "A devout follower of the light, Esquire DiDraco, or as others know her, Meepers. She is often seen in prayers on the holy day of Dimache.", "Not only is Ryan rumoured to have been in the possession of grain, but he has also been openly showing it to others, in a crowded bar, no less! Good think Jace and Anabella intervened.", "What a good chap that Jace is. I heard he, and some others aided to stop a slave from using grains and reported the event to the superiors so the constables can handle it.", "You know how mos people are really lazy about informing the constables of bad things? Well Taraji ain't one of those people. She has been diligent to report things to her superiors so they can inform the constables. That's important, especially if grain is involved.", "Giving out clothes to the needy, listening to their ails and giving good advice, that's what Taraji is to friends.", "A real gentleman, people say. No wonder some envy his mate, Taraji.", "Some people, not only does Inez openly admit to her questionable profession, but she also gives away names of her clients. I wonder how she expects to have any clients that can pay in the long run.", "That Hush is such a creative doctor. Using steaks to have her students practice the stitching on. Who would have thought. I hope they let a beggar eat the food after it, stitches or no stitches.", "Courting different people is one thing, but Althea openly talking about her previous mates is not something people should hear in public.", "Esquire DiDraco, also known as Meepers is valued by the church. She understands the process of power within the Church, she asks for a boon and then makes a donation to the Church within her means.", "Some watch with growing worry and envy, that Veritas Rhys' mercenary company spreads in various non martial fields. Traders, blacksmiths, all are drawn to the Sentinels. When he goes to the competition for teachers, will that backfire to anyone, I wonder.", "Ryan has truly embraced the spirit of S'Allumer, unconditionally forgiving people for their past sins and transgressions against him, he made an impressive display of what it means to be an Penitent.", "That brash horse, Clover? He is a real Docktown fellow, anyone can tell that by the crude remarks he makes while staring at women's derriere. Not something you'll see in Newtown.", "Shhh, shh, have you heard of Hush? Once upon a time she has been courting Master Ekalah, but as he left town, she had to move on. But I heard she has been causing issues about some jewelry he gifted to his new love? Women and jewels. Who can understand them.", "Jayland is so polite all the time! Always quick to help people when he can, like when when Virendra was injured, he instantly helped him to the infirmary. Courtesy not always expected in Docktown.", "Meepers was thoughtful enough to adopt a child of her own breed. She does deserve a bit of happiness.", "A package was delivered to Jace, full on money. He soon learned the money didn't belong to him, and he sent it onward to Clover. That was the proper thing to do, yet so few would have followed that behavior.", "A package was delivered to Taraji's mate, full on money. They realised the money didn't belong to him, and sent it onward to Clover. Mighty thoughtful and proper of them.", "Clover is said to be a caring guy, making people smile, when they feel all upset and down. Look how he cheered up Opal the other day.", "Hush certainly knows how to make deals. When asked she agreed to put a hold on her bidding on the auction item, she sought, so Veritas would not miss out on it. That's how you make gestures.", "What an honest girl, that Taraji is. She and Jace were having a package of coins she could put away without consequences, yet they returned it to Clover. I tell you, that's a big deal!", "What an honest man, that Jace is. He and Taraji were having a package of coins he could put away without consequences, yet they returned it to Clover. I tell you, that's a big deal!", "Even after Ryan was sold, Jahren, having the best interest of the town on mind, decided to keep training Ryan without charges, so all could benefit from their skills.", "Virendra, that wolf? You know him? What a rude guy. When Clover called him up to his room to have a private conversation where he could have got a well paid job from Dame Valara, he just kept growling to his wife in their wolf tongue, closing out both the host and the Dame from the conversation. He should know better then to insult those people. How does he expect to get paid jobs from them this way?", "You know Madalina? What a rude lass. When Clover called her up to his room to have a private conversation where she could have got a well paid job from Dame Valara, she just kept growling to her husband in their wolf tongue, closing out both the host and the Dame from the conversation. She should know better then to insult those people. How does she expect to get paid jobs from them this way?", "Wynter from the Rinaldi is a real caring and sweet woman. She takes all the unwanted clothing and changes them into fashionable, good quality items. She has golden hands when it comes to seamstressing.", "Many claim that Ryan, the slave is a slave by heart, but he can stand up for things he believes in, even if he has to oppose Clover for it. Brave move. I am curious what Sir Brooks is to say about that.", "Why does a landed person care for the eating habits of a slave? I heard Cullan went a long while to make sure Ryan stops eating vegetables.", "Sir Brumble is a prominent person, Zander noticed it and went out of his way to assist him in his daily deeds, bringing tea and helping with any matters tasked with. Impressive and smart.", "Sparring has different rules in Docktown and Newtown, but even so, Veritas should not have continued sparring Zander after seriously injuring him, nor acting callous while his sparring partner was being treated, you know.", "He might have caused dire damage to Zander while sparring and having a bit of fun about him, but he was good sports then, making sure Zander is taken care of and having hot chocolate while recovering.", "Ryan seems to act better since owned by Sir Brooks. The slave made sure that wounds of Lord Samstag is treated properly after the Lord's sparring match.", "That Guardsman Biggs really cares about the people of Triskellian! When that crazy panther Kafka attacked someone in the jail and held them hostage, Biggs was the only one who was worried about them getting hurt. All the other guards were too busy talking - one of them even told the hostage to shut up! We definitely need more guards like him, who take their jobs seriously and actually care about people.", "That Kafka is one crazy panther! He attacked someone who came by the jail and held them hostage in an attempt to get the Sheriff to let him go, can you believe it? He was already in jail, so he obviously doesn't know how to behave, but even that's taking it a bit too far.", "When found Lord Otto von Samstag in need of a healer, esquire DiDraco, also known as Meepers, hurried to his aid, the seamstressing practice must have come handy for patching up his shoulder.", "Zev stood by Lord Samstag and did his very best to protect the lord, when conflict with Jaren happened, even though he could have been gutted in the process. None can have anything against a bloke with a spine.", "Virendra was very willing to help out any stranger who is new to the city, showing them numerous places and introducing them to citizens. Making new people feel welcome is an example we should all follow.", "Hrm, Augustus? Keep the tone down. You know what I heard? He provided false testimony against a noble's personal rival to gain the noble's favor. Though who doesn't do that? No good pulling whiskers of nobles.", "Defending your house is important, but is that worth enough to lie to the constables in order to harm personal enemies of your house' nobles? Many would say yes. Especially if it comes to the Doloreaux.", "Meepers and Virendra needed some plants and didn't know what to do, but that slave? Ryan? He did his best to assist in obtaining said plant. Real helpful of him.", "It takes a lot of guts to stand up against a house, not to mention if it is the Doloreaux, you have to face. But Gnaeus did just that, to ensure the freedom of Docktown denizens. Rhea and Jarek surely appreciated his efforts.", "Some say, Hush is quick to throw her fellow commoners under the carriage if it looks like it'll get her in good with a noble. Or maybe she just happened to agree with the noble?", "An upstanding citizen, that Chesh. I was told, he defended an innocent man from false charges, despite his personal feelings.", "Kilana was willing to risk his goodstanding with the Doloreaux in order to defend the commoner's rights. Or was it more done for Rhea and Jarek? People say both things.", "Senora is loyal to her house, I heard she has testified in favor or her house in the case about Rhea and Jarek. The Doloreaux have always been a close knit house.", "Oh my, an Avoirdupois who publicly makes fun from nobles wearing tutus in private? Nan should know better to keep certain laundries behind closed doors.", "Sir Brooks has trained his former slave quite well.  The young serf has manners that reflect quite well upon his Master.  Nor could one fault him for his generous nature.", "Krell knew he can not beat Chinco, but he risked his life, as the Constabulary's interest and his own duty so demanded. People like him make the Constabulary an establishment that makes Triskellian proud.", "That Ammy lass? If you feel you need a lapwarmer, she might be the one to ask, I heard she is free to sit on men's lap in the commons. Though you might get slapped if you try. Lasses are fickle things.", "Risking his own life Chinco fought capably when the sylphs requested an excursion to the sewers to collect spider silk.", "Sable risked her own life in order to obtain the spider silk needed for the sylphs. Brave and heroic deed of her.", "Miss Noire Shirune heard someone was in need and didn't hesitate to offer her assistance in collecting spider silk, despite the obvious dangers.", "Despite only having arrived in the city a few days prior, mister Damon Case jumped at the chance to offer assistance collecting spider silk for the sylph Ileana.", "Did you see who Lancepesade Cullan was walking around with today?  Some slim buxom birman who was only wearing a chainmail bra!  He was showing her the performers in the marketplace, but his eyes were certainly not on THOSE performers...", "From his reputation you might not know it, but some claim that Valentin Forza is one of the most professional business men in Triskellian. He understands the finer points of business, including working with others and has no hesitation paying very well for goods and services.", "Doctor Jahren is very generous with his services and knowledge, offering both free of charge and only asking for donations if his clients believe his work merits it. Though some claim this causes the economy to have some imbalance. Still quite charitable of him.", "Whenever you want to find Jahren, he'll be in the infirmary, tirelessly tending to the needy and sick, no matter how cranky they are or how tired he is.", "You may not hire anyone in your guild that is not fitting into that guild perfectly. Or so mister Virendra thinks. He went to lengths to try to revoke Chesh's guild's charter just because he hired an entertainer. I wonder why he thinks a mercenary guild needs to entertainment. Hrm.", "Virendra ain't getting more friends by mimicking and taunting people, especially if they are from the Avoirdupois. Who is surprised Nan took offence?", "Did you hear about the Dean of the university? No, the woman, not the crazy one. I hear she's courting someone, but still went up to some other man's room to drink whiskey. For an awful long time. You would think someone of her station would know to take an escort. Wine and women, I wonder if there was any song?", "Hear that Clover's been inviting women up to his room, without escorts? That rascal! I bet this isn't going to help him rise in society, but from what I hear, his aspirations are much lower, so he can get away with this.", "I hear that Mr Clover is a really friendly guy. It's good advice to be friendly, when you're in his line of work, it makes certain he has lots of friends around. And he'll continue to be your best friend... until he's not. Then you'd better run away fast, because if he catches up with you, you won't be able to run on those legs anymore...", "Did you hear that Sir Bayard went slumming through the sewers to fight some spiders, or collect their silk. Don't the Avoirdupois have any guards that could have been sent instead?", "So Ryan called a guild council meeting on behalf of Faile, and represented her. But Clover wasn't happy about that. He was so unhappy that he... that... I just can't talk about it. OK, I'll try. He was so angry that he... he called Ryan names! And he's usually such a polite young man!", "Miss Zenkuro is the honest sort. Unfortunately, she is honest about her profession too. She was willing to say to anyone she is a pickpocket. Let's hope that's just a bad jest. Just make sure you tie your pouches around her.", "Not only a good, but a patient teacher, Doctor Jahren. He remains polite and encouraging during teaching how to handle a bow, never laughing about missed shots. Isn't that what we all wish for ourselves?", "What goes around, comes around. That's what they say. But why would Calista work for someone she badmouths behind his back? Doesn't make much sense for me.", "You know what they speak of Celia? She is a smart, proactive and capable business woman. She's very helpful if you need to get things for a reasonable price and in a timely manner. Good to know.", "Captain Carlon is an upstanding member of the Rinaldi. Yet, you know what they say about him? He has offered to train a member of the Avoirdupois, and free of charge even. Now if all could follow that example...", "Such a selfless fellow, Doctor Jahren. If you want to be a healer, make sure to read his book. He worked a lot to provide free knowledge for those who want to better themselves.", "What? What's wrong with people?! Didn't you know grain is illegal? Why eat it in the commons so blatantly? Maybe ask Shaira, why she did it.", "Nicki, a real friendly cat. I heard she is the one to seek if you care for free catnip. That must be why so many felines are around her.", "Running around drinking all the time is not what you want your kid to be remember you buy. But it seems that is the life Madalina is planning for her baby.", "I was trying to get some coin over at the dock, and you know what I saw? Edwardo trying to sell a bonefish for 10 denari. And when he couldn't fool the others he was telling them, they are bad merchants? Arrogance can go a long way. But not always.", "My sister was in the Commons the other day. She came home all unsettled and told me he overheard Flynn offering a woman to try him out, and the women then gladly headed off with him toward his room.  But you know little sisters, they talk a lot.", "My sister was in the Commons the other day. She came home all unsettled and told me she overheard a man offering Calista to try him out, and she then gladly headed off with him toward his room.  I hope it's just a little sister talking too much.", "Dahlia is known for her generosity, giving free clothing from poor people that recently arrived to town and having the dust of the road still on their clothing.", "Paladins are allowed to have wives, yet they are still an example we are to follow. But is Damon to show a proper example, I ask? Coming to town claiming to be a paladin only to run off with the first woman that shows interest in him to a private room. Tisk tisk. Wait till the church hears of this.", "We all know, how Virendra is, cheating on his wife right after she left, but honestly, in the jail? Did he think the guards are blind? That place is full of constables! Some people just feel no shame!", "Zenkuro, young and beautiful? Sure. But certainly not decent. Getting intimate with a man in the jail? In front of all the constables? The jail is Constable HQ for S'allumer's sake! You can't burp one without having an elbow in your mouth.", "She made a heap of jewelry to practise or somethin' an' then just gave it all away. How generous. She even made sure it got distributed evenly between the people present.", "We thought by now Virendra learned not to pick fights in a bar, too many witnesses. But if you do, at least have the guts to admit it.", "Promising to treat a patient, people wonder why Jahren wanders off to chat with Hush instead. Who wouldn't want to know what Doctors speak of between themselves.", "It seems every time I'm hearing about someone go off talking to Zeiss, they come back a bit queasy at best. You'd think after all these years, and criminal charges, folk would learn not to be in the same room alone with him. Though only really bothers me of course when its a friend looking all perturbed.", "Randomly insulting people that aren't even around to defend themselves is a bad way to go about getting friends. Specially dangerous people.", "You know Esquire Xena? A good person to do business with. She will not accept downpayments, only after she provided the service. Lucky for the Rinaldi to have her.", "Not even greeting people before engaging them in conversation and being rude with them is not something that'll aid Zeiss in getting rid of his excommunication, is it?", "That Virendra's getting smarter! In order to accelerate the resolution of his black magic problems with the Church, he offered to aid them by lending out some of his warrioristic guild members.", "It's not only the Church spreading the word of S'allumer! Esquire Lianaar herself is committed to preserving the integrity of her faith, and hasn't had any problem speaking the word and acting to protect it. I spy a secret paladin.", "Dame or not, Katrina is ever generous in sacrificing her personal time and income to matters of import. Most recently she was caught donating to aid in the finding of a cure for the sick.", "What's up with the clergy these days? After learning black magic was performed in front of the chapel, miss Tomoe dismissed it saying she couldn't react or respond without Presbyter Ximen around. It's no wonder curses and a lack of faith in the Church are spreading.", "Miss Nan is really good about making introductions between people who are unfamiliar with one another. We need more proper, polite, and well-mannered individuals like her in the city.", "Need a good notetaker? Just ask Ryan. I hear he took exquisite minutes of the guild council meeting for people who weren't in attendance.", "While most artists will agree that the physical form is beautiful and something to be admired, mister Sang has taken it to a whole new level by verbally promoting nudity in the commons. Some opinions should simply be kept private, or at least are better expressed in a private setting.", "Nobody seems to know whether Chesh is married to Kilana or not, but plenty of people know he has a fondness for kissing her in public. Methinks someone needs to learn the rules of courtship and the boundaries for affection in public settings.", "Nobody seems to know whether Chesh is married to Kilana or not, but plenty of people know they have a fondness for kissing in public. Methinks someone needs to learn the rules of courtship and the boundaries for affection in public settings. And shame on her for purring!", "People are complaining that Ryan gets into their business too much, and that he's just going to get himself in trouble because of it. Maybe waiting to be invited into business first would be the best solution?", "I hear it took Sang four months to finish one item! It's too bad the bloke who told me didn't let me know whether it was worth the wait or not...", "Doctor Hush is a good friend to have. I hear she took it upon herself to gift Clover a wooden basin when she found out he was looking for one from Sang.", "If you want a good contract written up, Vajhira's the girl to contact. I hear she's even working on her temper, so she might be more pleasant to work with.", "Loyalty is a virtue that's worth recognizing, and Santiago has it in spades; just ask around.", "I heard Luciano went crazy in the commons and ended up stabbing Ammy. Chinco Jr. sure is growing up to be something ... special.", "How many times can someone threaten that they're leaving the city without ever actually doing it? Just ask Madalina - she's on her way out again supposedly. Hurry along then, and if you make it anywhere, don't forget to write!", "Take a tip boys: Giving lands as a pre-wedding gift to your bride-to-be shows trust, generosity, and an understanding of the impact of economy on a marriage. If you want to know how to make a woman happy, just go and ask Clover for advice.", "Doctor Hush is a good healer and kind enough to share her healing supplies with Doctor Jahren, though she might not want to drag the doctor from treating a patient while doing such.", "If you don't like the clown's joke boo, maybe toss a rotten tomato at him, but don't follow Virendra's lead. No slapping the clowns, please!", "Virendra is a nice guy. Or is he not? Well it seems he did quite a lot of things to impress his wife. Be it name calling, rock throwing and mocking. I wonder if it was worth the effort.", "It is not the best thing for a woman to be seen entering men's chambers all on her own. Someone ought tell Bekka that.", "I saw Inquisitor Tomoe some time ago in public. Sitting on the lap of a guy clothed but in loincloth. What secrets was she prying from him?", "If you want to buthead with the church, be careful. I heard Mufasa did it right in the lounge. Bad idea, I tell ya!", "I heard Nan saw Virendra take a wolf skull, draw magical symbols on the ground, make the skull glow...and she never reported this heresy and black magic to either the church or the Constabulary! That leaves everyone in danger by staying silent and practically condoning the behaviour.", "When Doctor Jahren had issues with Flynn, he didn't just drop contract, but kept his side of the bargain and sought resolution calmly like a gentleman. And thus, the resolution was found.", "When the Avoirdupois needed aid in a dangerous assignment, for the good of all, miss Maena offered her services for way less then the danger would demand it.", "Shhh, you know what I heard? I heard Virendra permormed black magic rituals, right in the commons. Was he not scared priests come from the chapel? But then, I ain't seen the priests putting him on a stake yet, so who knows.", "Helen is said to be a very competent business woman when it comes to interguild relations and negotiations. She almost single handedly managed to preserve a lucrative business arrangement for her guild with her light touch and skilled diplomacy. That's word on the streets.", "Inquisitor Tomoe has been seen around the Maison in company. Well, woman of ill repute need to take confessions too, but why not in the chapel?", "Triskellian is the very heart of the S'allumnitan religion. A bad place for Sinjaa to speak of how the Lord of light is just made up and how its followers are all weaklings.", "Helen is a faithful follower of S'allumer honoring the sanctuary of Dimache.", "When Taraji was seeking someone to sponsor her for promotion, she didn't just ask for it, but she sought to become educated about the rank, what would be expected of her, how it would effect herself, the company and her role in the company she was working it.. She made sure she knew exactly what she was getting and what was expected of her. That's the responsible thing to do.", "You know Polgara's brother, that big tiger Mufasa? Well, I saw him dragging poor Inquisitor Tomoe around the Commons by the arm, berating her for... *ahem* Private issues. There's something to be said about a man who airs his dirty laundry so freely. Especially if clergy is involved.", "Shaking people in the commons stating they like someone more then them is odd, even for someone like Mufasa.", "Not only did Virendra engage in fights in the commons, but he didn't have the decency to remain quiet about it. Still, writing it all up on the lounge's boards?", "Miss Helen is quite a civic person, even if people like Virendra are set to annoy her, she keeps her cool and expresses her displeasure without being insulting or emotional. If only more people knew how to do that...", "Deputy Krell is a known figure of the Constabulary. I heard he is man enough to apologise for his short comings and alter his behaviour if needed. Virendra might learn something from him.", "Some gentry have taken notice to Clover's eccentric methods of dressing and taken right to complaining... for good reason. Apparently this sizable man has an affinity for wearing female undergarments and finds no shame in sporting them, and himself, publicly. Being unique is one thing, and being inappropriate another; perhaps someone should offer to make him a robe for such adventurous occasions?", "I hear that big tiger, Khagra, he was seen often in Church when he was leading the Rhashak Clan. He sure has come a long way. Making up for past mistakes and shortcomings by trying to spread the teachings of the Light all the way back to his home lands and attending Church whenever he can. The church is always a good solution!", "Tiberius made a good start in his employ with the Constabulary. Soon after being shown how, he already got down to papers and did all the administration on his own. Initiative people are always welcome in places like that.", "Come on, Chinco, do you never learn? Attacking a constable now? You should find something other then that to entertain yourself with.", "Being bored is a state for Chinco, I heard. One that makes him grab a weapon and whack people with it. Bad bad habit. Someone should tell him to learn sewing instead. Just not me.. you there, you tell him?", "What to do if your friend gets attacked? Stand by and watch idly, I heard that's what Sinjaa did. I don't want to know how Tiberius repaid his loyalty.", "That Virendra, he might be just not as bad as people say. He is kind enough to make healer's life easier by distracting their patients from pain so they can work on them swiftly and professionally. That-a-boy.", "Chinco is determined to pull the whiskers of nobles by his continual disrespect. Guess what? He manages. I heard more and more nobles are getting quite annoyed by that man.", "People getting into conflict with Ryan always get irked.  I wonder if it is the boy or that he chooses badly in whom to get in conflict with.", "I heard, Ryan was chiding someone above his rank about their own child. Rude and also not really any of the slave's business, what you say?", "That artist, Sang? I heard he was sick as a dog and collapsed right in the commons! Hurt his head something fierce. But not to worry, his friend, what's her name? Vajhira Rhashak, that's right! Well, she took good care of him and made sure he got to a healer just in time.", "Not only is Tiberius diligent in his tasks as a constable, but he is also motivates others by his good example. I heard even Joshua caught up on his old missives seeing the deputy work.", "Ryan is certainly loyal to the Avoirdupois. I heard he has been filling in Brenner on news and the house on all things of interest.", "The Avoirdupois were always chivalrous people. People say Dame Valara is one of the best examples of them, one that understands why some topics are just not meant for anyone's ears. If only more followed her example.", "Tiberius is quite collegial, inviting others in the constabulary for drinks. But smart enough to buy non alcoholic drinks since duty can await at any corner.", "If you need a seamstress working on short notice and even take the initiative to decide on some matters about clothing, then Nan is the perfect person for you. I heard she is good with working under pressure.", "Questioning your superiors is slippery ground. You can not ignore flaws, but you can not openly question them either, unless you are a Bisclavret, I was told. And even there it has dire consequences. Still, questioning your house leader openly in the commons with the half town witnessing it is just making the challenger, the leader and the house look bad as a whole. Why did Brenner go on with it anyway?", "Sir Bayard knows how etiquette works. He asked his house's leader for permit on courting before he progressed with it.

Declining when invited by a knight is disappointing.", "Calling out the Rinaldi Reeve in the commons because she declined a lesson in matriloquentia is hardly professional nor Knightly.

I've yet to meet a wolf what wasn't all screwed up in the head.", "Despite not knowing as much about causing bodily harm or the dangers of Triskellian as much as other people, Tor was more than willing to lead the spider-hunting group into the sewers!

I thought the same thing.", "They say Virendra was pretty gallant during the spider hunt, despite having his tail bitten.  I did the same thing last time I got my tail bit.  Gallant.  All the way.  Where's my praise?", "Gegnar the bear?  Yeah!  He's like a living shield, so they say.  I hear he was brave enough to head into the spider lair first just to  make sure no one got hurt right away!  Mighty selfless of him if I do say so myself.  Which I do.  I have opinions, I must share them.", "Aldus? A good teacher, taking great care in  delivering lessons and checking how far students follow and comprehend what is to be learned.

At least he made great efforts to behave well around some higher ranked people, sticking to etiquette all the time. That counts for something, right?", "Carlon of the Rinaldi have been honourable Captain of the Rinaldi Guard for quite long time. When he was asked to step down, he behaved with dignity and honour, not allowing his personal feelings to interfere with the interests of the house. That is why the Rinaldi respect him.", "Not only did Carlon put the interests of the house before his personal interests and stepped back from the captain position with grace and complaints, he also proffered to aid the new captain prospect with growing into a captain the house needs.", "Sir Brumble is quite a knight, knowing all the fineries of diplomacy. Thus no wonder he is tasked with sensitive matters such as negotiations two houses in relations of inter house marriages.", "Not only was Virendra willing to risk his life and arrange for an expedition to try to find out about the fate of Dune, but he was also willing to pay for the expedition from his own coffers.", "When Virendra was pointing out he is doing his best to learn from the fate of Dune, his wife, Dahlia, while being thankful, kept repeating she never asked Virendra to make the expedition. I don't know about you, but I would just put my hands together and pray my thanks for anyone willing to do that for me and my husband.", "When the situation arose, Kingsley stood in front of Xena to defend her, just like a good house guard should do.", "I was doing my little rounds and came by the commons some time ago, and what did I see? Chinco? That wolf who has no right to bear weapons?

That's pretty nice. But I heard she suggested brawl instead, which is just a different form of violence, no?", "Chinco, I heard was fighting in the commons, as per usual. He demanded Virendra apologize to him and attacked even after the apology was extended.", "Kingsley has a whole set of great ideas, but he can not stick to one place for too long. He keeps walking out on people even if he is in a conversation with his superior. And then he returned, I heard, only to question the relevance of the superior's advice.", "That Bekka lass needs to get a brain. There's nothing cute about trying to always be cute.

Someone the house will favor soon enough, I bet.", "Clover LePlow is a boss you want to work for, I am told. He supports his men, gives them whatever they need and protects them to the death if they're loyal to him.", "Krell knows how to handle matters in a polite and proper way.

That's dedication!", "Ramsford showed excellent fighting skills and teamwork during the encounter with the bandits, and did his best to ensure the safety of the people around him, even defending those he wasn't overly fond of from the beginning. To even initially volunteer for something that bears no reward, and especially just days before your own wedding, speaks volumes.", "Meepers sure is nice when it comes to helping people with wedding arrangements.

It's super swell when people are so thoughtful.", "Wearing fluttery fairy wings on a daily basis instead of reserving them for costume parties makes people question your sense of style.

Now there's a doctor with her priorities in the wrong order.", "Miss Nan went and played at Ramsford and Brie's wedding reception for free, gifting unexpected music to everyone present at the event.", "Some things are better left unsaid. When engaged in a conversation about dreams and acceptance, miss Nan took it upon herself to deem social conformists mean land-holders. Not everyone who holds land is a conformist, and conforming to some things is more appropriate than speaking out against them.", "During Ramsford and Brie's wedding reception, miss Helen was so focused on her own wedding arrangements that she started trying to hire the best man and musical entertainment for her own event! It would have been much more appropriate for her to wait and discuss her plans later, rather than take away from someone else's special time.", "Nan showed up to provide musical entertainment for Brie and Ramsford's wedding reception after they couldn't find anyone else to do it. If you ever need a musician, now you know where to go.", "Clover not only ran and organized the expedition to find Redbeard and the band of pirates, but also threw a follow up party and celebration afterward using his own money and resources.

They say rewarding good behavior encourages good behavior, and since he didn't have to, it made it even better.", "I hear mister Virendra goes mute when Rinaldi women enter the room.

Better to risk not seeing them than setting yourself up in a failed interaction.", "Mister Kaine tried his best to help out with a criminal investigation by having suspects do some practice shooting at the archery range to gauge their skills. The Constabulary was just tickled pink by his willingness to aid them.", "*le gasp* Ery loosed her sailors tongue on a constable in the infirmary. That might sound worse than it actually was. The point is, you shouldn't curse at law enforcement.", "Miss Nan was speaking improperly to a superior about their tone of voice when she was, in fact, mistaken in thinking it was an act of unkindness. Don't people know by now not to correct their superiors? It never ends well.", "Everyone knows it's appropriate to ask for leave from a Noble if you've been engaged in a conversation with them, but if you don't know they're a Noble, then take a lesson from miss Maggie.

At a recent reception, they say all she did was whine and complain. Talk about an event spoiler.", "After a first and second request from a Noble to remove her mask, Maggie was said to still refuse.

It's a good thing she did too, because nobody else from her embassy showed up.", "Hush was very polite and praised Madalina and Virendra for their work on the pirate raid voyage, even though their personal relationships weren't golden at the time.", "Good for Noe. At least one of the Avoirdupois aristocrats could get off their backsides to show up and thank the people who did the job of their embassy for them. Even if fighting pirates is too hard for the likes of Nobility, at least one might have been able to walk a few blocks and say some nice words.", "Miss Noe represented the Avoirdupois house at the reception held for those who fought against Redbeard. It was nice that she could take on the sudden job of delivering medals and handing out recognitions.", "More people sing the praises of Clover for his holding a reception to honor those who aided in fighting Redbeard. I'm sick of hearing about it, to be honest with you. And, hey, where's my rum?", "Virendra was nice enough to loan Redbeard's flag to Clover for a reception honoring those who went on the expedition. See, he isn't all bad.", "Virendra was said to have lent Clover the flag he acquired after the battle against Redbeard, trusting that it would be looked after. Right nice of him, wouldn't you say?", "If you're unfamiliar with town and need to learn the ways of the city, just ask miss Dahlia for help. I hear she's really good about greeting new inhabitants and making them feel welcome.", "If you have children, don't worry when they're around Chinco. I hear he's willing to dispose of potentially hazardous garbage to keep them from stepping on it, even if you don't ask him to.", "Esquire Meepers was lingering in the commons after dark with her daughter while a violent criminal was on the loose. You would think getting shot at with an arrow while your baby is in your arms would teach you to be more careful, but apparently not.", "People generally think Dahlia should have been more proactive in arranging an expedition to find her husband's remains. She was okay with pronouncing him dead and letting his body rot wherever until someone else put up the money for a group to go search for him. Even then, she didn't ensure that a competent leader was in charge, or that the group was prepared for what they might encounter.", "Dahlia went along on the expedition to find her husband's body, despite being an obvious liability due to her having no combat-related knowledge. Some people think it would have been better if she didn't attend, regardless of her personal relationship to the victim, while others think it was very appropriate for her to be present. I can see how it would work in both cases.", "It was kind hearted of Virendra to volunteer to lead an expedition to find Dune though he should have realized his lack of leadership skills and appointed someone else to lead. During the expedition, he was indecisive and only acted when pressured to by others. Then when the fighting was done, he spent more time joking around than tending to Suavis who was near death and eventually died.", "Suavis did some amazing work on the expedition to find mister Dune's remains. He even sacrificed his own life to keep everyine in fighting shape so they could ward off the bandits they stumbled upon.", "Despite the tedious nature of administrative work, Tomoe is more than willing to do what has to be done so that the church functions as it should -- even if it cuts into her free time.", "Suavis' heroic combat medic activities were indescribable! When the Dune expeidition party discovered a bandit army and engaged in combat with them, he was there, at every scratch and gash to fix up the fighters.  If you are gonna be in a battle, take Suavis with you!", "Mister Sang is apparently not only the best artist around these parts, but he's also the best teacher of music, and he charges a cheap, fair price for sharing his talents with anyone willing to learn without bias. This is a good way to encourage the growth and learning of people in the city with the expert toutelage of a Master passing down his knowledge.", "Mister Sang made the verbal assumption that one is a 'muscle-headed brute' if they hold a weapon in a dangerous part of town. In this case, the observation wasn't taken appreciatively. Perhaps more constructive criticism in the future is the way to go, hm?", "Miss Helen's recent generosity to a newcomer didn't go unnoticed. Apparently giving aureals to the passerby lands you big rewards in the gossip column, but also lighter purses.", "Miss Helen has been very supportive and patient with her betrothed's daughter and dealings involving her. She has put up with so much more than most anyone in the city would when it comes to Vajhira's attitude.", "When speaking on the topic of marriage in the commons, miss Helen verbally contemplated the impact an eloping would have on the house Rinaldi. She is always very considerate of the embassy when deciding her actions, and realizes everything she does reflects on her betrothed as well.", "Murders got you down? If you want to learn how to protect yourself with a dagger, seek out mister Cullan. I hear he gives out free lessons.", "Knights have duties to perform, and not much to keep them busy in the city. When called together by one of.", "Knights have duties to perform, and not much to keep them busy in the city. When called together by one of their peers to discuss matters of their station, they should try to attend, but if they don't or can't, at least have the courtesy to send word. Perhaps they should be made more aware of the obligations incumbent upon their position?", "Miss Ery has once again offended someone by throwing rude gestures around when they attempt to help her. I guess the repetitious moral of the story is to help by not helping.", "I hear Dame Valara didn't attend the social Sir Brumble went through the trouble arranging for the nobles. A courtesy note wasn't even sent to let him know about a lack of attendance. You would expect more from Nobility.", "I hear Sir Bayard didn't attend the social Sir Brumble went through the trouble arranging for the nobles. A courtesy note wasn't even sent to let him know about a lack of attendance. You would expect more from Nobility.", "I hear Sir Brooks didn't attend the social Sir Brumble went through the trouble arranging for the nobles.

A courtesy note wasn't even sent to let him know about a lack of attendance. You would expect more from Nobility.", "I hear Lady Grazia didn't attend the social Sir Brumble went through the trouble arranging for the nobles. A courtesy note wasn't even sent to let him know about a lack of attendance. You would expect more from Nobility.", "Sir Brumble arranged for a social for Knights of the city, sent them invites, posted reminders on the public boards, and even arranged for cognac and thrilling topics of discussion. It's too bad nobody showed up except Lord Marcus to appreciate it.", "Miss Omen is very good abuot acknoweldging rank and understanding the importance of an aristocrat's time. That's something that will continue to gain her favor if she remains mindful.", "Ever reverent, Mistress Meepers joined Sir Edmond in an impromptu prayer for her child's well-being. She will continue to be a faithful penitent of the Light, spreading the word and love of S'allumer wherever she goes.", "Mister Chesh was a hero after the spider fight. He carried Molly all the way up to the infirmary, and waited there to make sure she didn't need anything. She sure took a beating from those spiders, and it was good that he was there to help her.", "Mister Fyros has always shown great diligence and loyalty as guard to Lady Grazia. His kindness and respect easily extends to the rest of his House as well as the general population of Triskellian.", "Mister Fyros apparently emerged as a leader during the Dune expedition. He is said to have aggressively pursued the attacking bandit leader, despite being outmatched.", "The Rinaldi continuously praise the efforts of miss Lianaar who goes outside the requirements of her position with assisting members of the Embassy in reaching their maximum potential.", "What's this? Miss Helen is being recognized for taking a stand against Chinco for the Rinaldi, even though she isn't a member of the House at all. Pretty brave if you ask me, especially considering he could probably snap her like a twig.", "Joined the Rinaldi but decided you didn't like working for a House? Just talk to mister Fyros! I hear he'll go out of his way to help place you in another career better suited to your tastes.", "I heard that in an effort to curb the poor behavior of Vajhira, Lady Aria lo Bianco appealed to Khagra to allow for an arranged marriage. A lot of punishments can come from poor actions, but it seems people favor the Lady's method of devising something more creative that would benefit her embassy while still getting her point across. Yay for smart people!", "Jaws dropped as Deputy Tremain insisted on publicly searching miss Zeera in the commons simply because he believed she was lying to him due to her past crimes. Think it would have been more appropriate for him to have taken her to the jailhouse, or somewhere a bit more private? I'm thinking so.", "Seems a newcomer to town stepped up and offered to perform an impartial search on miss Zeera for the local Deputy Tremain. Even though it didn't happen, people were impressed someone was willing to step up in an effort to uphold the law, maintain dignity, and promote peaceful resolution.", "That Fyros volunteered to go on an expedition to find mister Dune's body, and was said to protect miss Xena throughout the entire encounter from bandits. Rinaldi or not, that's bravery, and an exemplary example of a good guard.", "They say mister Virendra volunteered to act as leader of the expedition to find mister Dune's body, but that he actually had little to no leadership skills. People came back gossiping that during the encounter, he didn't have any plans on how to actually fight the bandits, and even allowed a healer to be killed! Whew, I wouldn't want that on my conscience.", "People are raving about what an amazing medic mister Suavis is. During the bandit encounter, it's said that he managed to keep the majority of people who went bandaged and capable of fighting, even though he was the only one with healing skills available. And at the end of the whole ordeal, he gave his life! What a great sacrifice, and what an example to set for other healers in the city.", "Always saying one thing and doing another? That's what they say about mister Khagra. Supposedly he vowed to shun his daughter from hsi family after some ridiculous behavior toward his House, but then recanted and decided to try to give her yet another chance to redeem herself. It's no wonder he's big on giving endless chances to his own family, but would he be so understanding to someone not related to him? The world may never know ..", "Mister Kaine is said to care a great deal about his people and the city itself. It seems recently he has been on high guard looking for Ery, who attacked poor miss Rosemarie. It sure woul be nice to have more guards like him looming about.", "It seems miss Hush has been bringing up personal topics in front of the gentry, and even when she is told to stop due to stepping over social boundary lines of rank, she continues to persist. There's a lesson to be learned here! Don't share your personal life with people who outrank you unless they explicity ask.", "Jahren is praised yet again for his ability to be kind even in stressful situations. It's said that after miss Rosemarie's attack, he remained steady and gentle with her, as all good healers should. Ahhh, it's good to know there are medics who can be trusted to be consistent.", "Miss Tomoe was being raved about the other day for bandaging people for free even though she had obligations elsewhere. Healing before business, I say! Unless healing is your business, and then it goes hand-in-hand, doesn't it?", "People seem to be pleased with Guardsman Biggs who was dutiful in performing a retrieval of a body from the bay, putting himself in harm's way for the honor and dignity of a murder victim. Honorable members of the Constabulary are always a welcome and relieving sight to the city!", "Despite being injured, mister Kaine assisted a Guardsman in retrieving miss Hush's body from the bay. Way to go out of the line of duty to do something good!", "The Guardsman is the talk of the town still for doing his best in trying to find Hush's killer against very difficult odds. They say he's been giving it his all, even going so far as to jump into the bay of Auvrich to fish for her body. Talk about dedication!", "People's tongues are wagging talking about miss Demeter who was apparently very rude recently, interrupting conversations even though she was pointedly asked to wait before speaking. It's always better to be polite and patient than to have some beggar on the side of the road tattling on you for your transgressions.", "Gemma's giving advice for life again! She was overhead saying that if you have nothing nice to say, then not to say nothing at all. This was in response to someone being less than kind to her, so I say way for her to be the bigger person!", "There's a new storyteller in town, politely asking public loiterers if they want to hear his words before regailing them with tales. It's a nice change from the violent tendencies of Docktown, and people are noticing!", "Miss Helen has been working on murder investigations and cooperating with the Constables. They're all very impressed with her inclination to go beyond the call of a citizen of the city, and why shouldn't they be?", "The commons was gossiping about Aluine and Bekka openly arguing about Aluine 'sleeping around'. People should know by listening to me regularly that you need to take those kind of discussions to private places rather than having such conversations in public.", "People are all aflutter over the Dean of the University killing Madalina on the docks. Even if she came back from the dead not fully healed in the head, you can't get away with murder and not suffer the consequences.", "While I think it's pretty funny, other people aren't too happy about Santiago punching Leoric in the face right in the middle of the commons. If you want to greet a drinking buddy, that ain't the way to do it.", "Mister Silvanus was seen waving his gun around in the commons and trying to drag off miss Rhea despite being told only Constables have the authority to arrest people. You'd think a gentryman would know better than to behave like a wild man, but apparently he doesn't. Maybe a change of scenery is in order?", "Oy! Silvanus pulled his weapon on Rhea in the commons claiming she was a wanted criminal, but took the act further in becoming a vigilante and dragging her tail to the jailhouse. He didn't even lower his pistol when two members of his own House, and a member of the Bisclavret guard stood between him and Rhea, and continued to refuse to listen to reason. Talk about inappropriate behavior from a member of the gentry! I bet his House is just mortified.", "Wtinesses are verbally commending miss Helen for putting her life at risk by stepping between Gentleman Silvanus' gun and miss Rhea. It's a bit on the crazy side if you ask me, but you aren't asking me, so who cares? Anyway, others seem to think it impressive she can keep her cool even when people are acting irrationally.", "Put in favor for the wrong person.", "Despite being a convicted criminal, miss Rhea wasn't lashing out when Silvanus was yelling in her face and provoking her to do more. She turned to upstanding citizens to confirm what she had to say through words of logic rather than use of a rapier. Is reformation possible? We'd like to think so!", "Everyone is stepping in front of Silvanus' guns these days! Add mister Carlon to the list, who positioned himself before miss Rhea when the Esquire was acting out of control. He reasoned with his housemate to the best of his ability and eventually brought about a suitable outcome despite insult to himself and his House.", "So Silvanus is now a constable.  No really.  He tried to arrest Rhea in the commons.  For serious.  Oh wait, he's not a deputy? Then why was he waving his pistol and making a big show of arresting her, even though he can't!  He even threatened to shoot Carlon and Helen if they wouldn't get out of the way, despite their attempts to talk him out of getting himself arrested.  What is this world coming to?", "During the whole debacle with Silvanus and Rhea, it is said that miss Helen stalwartly stood at her housemate Carlon's side putting herself in harm's way in an attempt to dissuade Silvanus from shooting Rhea and getting himself arrested.  Now that takes some courage!", "More and more people come to tell me the tale of Silvanus, and they remain aghast to hear that one of the Rinaldi's own gentry would pull a gun, act vigilante, and even try to shoot through his own House members if he had to to arrest someone he didn't have any right to arrest.", "Old news, but still news regardless. Gentleman Silvanus .. yes, you guessed it .. tried to arrest Rhea despite not having the authority to do so, even going so far as to draw his gun on her. I'd act more surprised, but I've been telling these stories all day long.", "Even though Silvanus is said to have apologized for wrongfully trying to arrest miss Rhea, he reportedly continued to call the Constabulary incompetent afterward. I'm guessing they weren't inclined to believe his apology was sincere. I'm guessing I probably wouldn't have believed him either.", "Gentleman Silvanus is on a rant about Rhea being a pirate, but hasn't managed to gain a scrap of evidence. Even after Lord Marcus asked him to stop doing it, he continued to argue the point that he was right, disrespecting his own Noble and disobeying a superior's order. I see bad things coming in Silvanus' future from this whole fiasco ..", "Mister Zev is somebody's hero! I hear he came to Deputy Oushi's side while trying to apprehend miss Rhea and mister Jarek, and even got wounded while doing so. You know what they say - women like scars.", "Docktowners are complaining that miss Sapphire engaged in a public brawl in the center of the commons with mister Chinco and miss Vajhira. Apparently fighting in the slummier part of town is unexpected. Who knew?", "*tisk tisk* Seems Hadrien was caught engaging in a public brawl in the center of the commons with mister Chinco and miss Vajhira. Just how many people were invited to this party anyway?!", "Good to have that Biggs fellow around. He single-handedly took control and diffused a brawl in the commons, bringing all the wounded to the infirmary for treatment before investigating the crimes. Now -that's- how a competent lawman handles things.", "Some people whisper that the rumors about mister Hadrien aren't true. People witnessed him being removed from the brawl in the commons by Guardsman Biggs because he was bleeding, kneeling, weaponless, and not fighting upon his arrival. Poor guy ..", "Hadrian is actually a hero! He came to miss Sapphire's defense in a time of great need when she was outright assaulted by Chinco. Unfortunately, miss Vajhira set upon him, and he took a good licking for it.", "Seems Chinco is still .. Chinco. He aided Vajhira in an assault against Hadrian and miss Sapphire out of sheer boredom. That guy really needs to get a new hobby.", "Miss Opal took to diligently seeing to the wounds of those involved in a brawl in the commons. Sometimes I wonder if they'd keep brawling if there weren't good healers handy to always save them.", "I hear mister Sang was trying to persuade miss Vajhira and mister Chinco to spar somewhere besides the commons, and even urged onlookers to find a Constable for the brawl that took place. It might have been nicer had he gone and looked for a Constable himself, but, hey, small things count.", "Want free hat-making lessons? Go find Carolyn! I hear she'll help people out of the kindness of her heart.", "I hear miss Helen pays her bills quickly and in full. If you want a good customer, maybe you should look her up? Debt free is the way to be!", "Miss Xena is a tactical genius, or so I'm told. Between her and Mister Fyros, they rallied the troops and took down the bandit leader.", "Stealing corpses can be good - Xena retrieved the body of her fellow Rinaldi after the bandit incident. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about... don't you?", "Scandalous! I hear that miss Sunta snatched a folder out of someone's pouch and then went through their correspondence and teased them in the middle of the commons. That's definitely not appropriate behavior for a Rinaldi squire!", "They say even if you prattle off rude remarks to Doctor Hush, she's very understanding, a good listener, and always willing to accept an apology. How very gracious of her! It's nice to know that not everyone will punch you square in the face for being obnoxious.", "People have taken flirting back out of the bedroom and into the streets. I hear that miss Madalina was allowing mister Donovan to snuffle her hair and fondle her tail in the middle of the commons. I realize it's Docktown, but some things just are best kept private.", "People have taken flirting back out of the bedroom and into the streets. I hear that mister Donovan was snuffling miss Madalina's hair and fondling her tail in the middle of the commons. It's said he even proceeded to whine as she made it a point to tease him with her body. Really, take it to a private place!", "The Bisclavret are angrily ranting about mister Cullan being a traitorous ingrate, going behind the back of his house to seek employment with Lady Grazia without even asking the permission first. All those years of protection, land, money, and martial training, and that's the sort of treatment he gives to his embassy?! I bet he risks a lot more than just a dishonorable discharge, turning his back like that on the Bisclavret. Lesson: Don't take oaths and then act against them, or, if you're going to, at least don't get caught!", "Zev is good to have around, always retrieving corpses of someone or another and reporting crimes to the Constabulary. This time it seems it was one of his fellow housemates who needed toting to the Cathedral, and he promptly had a case opened to try to find out who had harmed them.", "Rumors speculate that mister Greeves gave a woman a cursed armband to make her fall in love with him and do inappropriate things against her will. Hard to say whether or not it's actually true, but an interesting story anyway.", "Reportedly, the Avoirdupois are quite disappointed in miss Nan, who made it a point to say she wished to return and be part of House activities, but then never showed up to a House meeting after expressing she would be there. Reliability is important as a servant! Better to say you aren't sure that you can make it than say that you can and never show.", "I hear miss Opal went to miss Hush for some training on how to handle plants, and instead of Hush encouraging Opal to try harder at gardening, she told her instead that she had no talent and should take up medic training. That's not a very good method of teaching if you ask me.", "I heard that miss Una has sloughed off on her studies, including religion, and that even though her ignorance of church practices might be considered unforgivable by some since she's the daughter of a Knight, mister Bernard offered anyway to help further her education, and even appeared to be understanding that her own father, Sir Brumble, hadn't seen to it already.", "Even though miss Nan has been otherwise occupied, it seems she has taken time while in the company of others to give several lessons to other seamstresses, going so far as to share tips and helpful advice. Crafters supporting crafters, as it should be.", "Detestable! Squire Cullan of the Bisclavret was heard leading a conversation on cannibalism in public. What an offensive subject, and to go as far as discussing the actual consumption of people and the possibility of using their skins for leather? Better keep an eye on this one ..", "Surprisingly, mister Bernard was heard having a conversation with Squire Cullan in public about eating people. Conversations about cannibalism are quite offensive to most people, and likely best kept private.", "Once again, Chinco was caught drawing his sword in the commons for no reason whatsoever, this time against Zev. Doesn't it ever get boring?!?!", "Miss Lidia is said to be handling Paladin Damon's too-public interest veryw ell, maintaining a polite distance. Compared to previous actions, that's certainly a step in the right direction, and one for which she should be commended.", "Mister Kaine is always ready to defend the defenseless, of ten preferring to use words instead of sword when conflicts arise, which isn't the norm for Docktowners. Gotta give credit where credit is due!", "Mister Chinco drew his weapon in the commons yet again, attempting to attack a rather crass mouthed zebra who was being particularly abrasive.  While I can understand him being upset, there is no reason to endanger others by causing violence in the commons.", "Citizens are appalled at the utter disregard that miss Tomoe has shown her betters. She apparently took charge of the church and suddenly felt that she could speak poorly of Nobility in public. She even went so far as to threaten to use her 'Church powers' to have rank taken away from a member of the Bisclavret. Is this really the sort of person we want representing our city's religion? I think not.", "I don't care what you say about mister Virendra, if you leave your bagpipes laying around, he's sure to return them undamaged. That's more than can be said for some people.", "Deputy Oushi deserves some recognition for all the good work she has been doing for the Constabulary in the absence of her superiors. They say shes really stuck with it through all the negativity, and that's certainly commendable.", "Seems like Lord Samstag needs to go back to etiquette school. I heard he stayed seated when Lord Marcus stood to leave after one of their discussions, rather than rising and bowing as is proper of Nobility. And you all think meetings between Nobles are casual. Hah!", "Chinco has reportedly been carrying weapons despite being banned from doing so, and was even caught causing a ruckus in the commons with miss Ashai. Surprising? No, not really. No, not at all. Still, ignoring bans isn't something to be ignored.", "People are singing the praises of miss Shade saying what a wonderful gardener she is. The story goes that the daisy patch outside the blacksmith building was dying, and after it was brought in to be kept warm, miss Shade started taking care of it for the city. It now is thriving as if it were never on the brink of death. Glory for her green thumb!", "Inalla's housemates are all extremely proud of her for trying to do everything she can to reorganize the embassy in absence of any true leaders. She struggles with limited authoirty and does what she can to keep everyone strong. What more could be wanted in the servant of a great House?", "Handmaiden Inalla has been doing an exemplary job trying to assist the Ambassador in running the House while he is busy with other duties. Such dedication speaks very well of her character and commitment, and is something to be commended.", "Mister Luciano was heard cursing in the commons for no reason whatsoever, and then proceeded to tell people to .. well, you get the picture .. whenever they asked him to mind his language. If a beggar can't repeat it, then you know it must be bad!", "People are gossiping that miss Carolyn has been low on coin due to debt, and even though she and miss Helen have been at odds, Helen came to her rescue with a much-needed loan. Despite not having talked in weeks due to a personal disagreement, she helped, which was notably generous of her.", "Handmaiden Inalla made dozens of outfits and other clothes, scarves and such, and donated them all to the church to give to the poor to help them stay warm this winter.  Although she donated them on behalf of the entire house, it is well known she is the seamstress of the Doloreaux, so people would like to praise her for her good and generous works publicly.", "It seems miss Nan can be included in the group of those donating to the church and sharing her good fortune with those whom need it most. Praise for the generous, nothing for the stingy.", "Chinco once again resisted arrest, leading to a large fight in the commons between himself, several Constabulary members, and a small handful of fighters. You know what I think? Someone needs to take away all the apples and the peaches in the city and then -maybe- you might get through to him.", "Apparently Madalina has been siding with Chinco, most recently when he was fighting the Constabulary. She even went so far as to offer to draw her weapon against them. That's all we need is for him to gather a following of like-minded people!", "While people may not agree with the crimes mister Virendra has committed, they recognize that he has accepted the charges of heresy against him and is stepping up to receive his punishments honorably. Good people sometimes do bad things, and when they accept the consequences of their actions, they show that they're capable of getting better. Here's to hoping that he actually corrects his ill behavior and chooses a better path.", "Mister Fips is nice enough to give lessons in gardening to those who want to know how to pick flowers without hurting any of the plants. Need a bloom to give to a lovely lady? Go poke him .. I bet he'll help you find some good ones.", "They say Luciano was yelling, screaming, and threatening Doctor Hush in an attempt to get whatever it was that he wanted from her, and even worse, that he did it in the presence of Lady Georgianna of House Bisclavret. At least he could have reserved the poor behavior until Nobility was away from the area.", "If you're a healer and need another healer to consult, then I strongly suggest you seek out Doctor Hush! She's always very helpful and willing to suggest thing to try and aid in someone's recovery, even occasionally going so far as to give out droughts. Professional support is always a key to success.", "Need discounted flowers? Become a recurring customer of Mister Fips' and you'll likely get them! Either that, or let him suspect you don't have much coin so he feels bad enough to lower his costs. Hey .. it works for other people.", "Reportedly miss Lianaar was asked to testify against mister Chinco, having been a witness to his crimes. It seems silly that a Baron would have to ask her three times before she would do it, but maybe she has been preoccupied with more important matters. Regardless, her inattention to following orders has caused a few tongues to wag.", "Mister Sattar seems to want to try and pretend that he was never demoted. He was heard insisting people call him 'Gentleman' when anyone who pays attention to rumors or the public boards knows that he was stripped of his gentry status. Talk about rude and improper!", "Seems Sir Erwin sent a scroll to Sir Brumble explaining he'd been out of town during the Knight gathering that was arranged, thus why he was absent. Reportedly, he's the first member of the chivalry to even do that much!", "Doctor Hush is never to be busy to see any patient, any time. She'll stop everything she's doing to see you, whether you're a commoner or a Noble, even if your injury is only trivial. What a fine example of selfless service to the community!", "When entering a discussion about a Noble who flaunted an affair with a commoner, Lord Adrien is reported to have made snide remarks to someone of far greater rank, even taking the side of the disgraced nobleman. Where does the man learn his manners? Harrowgate must be far wilder than anyone imagined.", "Whether Lady Anne knows you or not, she's willing to pray for you in times of need. Just ask Meepers, who had the Lady praying for her daughter, Aine, when she was sick. Aiding people through selfless acts is a marked trait of Nobility, so it's no wonder S'allumer blessed Anne with the rank she has today if these words are a true reflection of her character.", "Out of all the people who signed up to participate in miss Nan's play, mister Bernard was the only original actor to show up. That's a true display of reliability right there.", "Supposedly miss Noire attended a wedding clad in armor. People have been complaining about what a racket she made as she strolled in very late to the event. I guess if you're going to show up tardy, it's best to at least be in the proper attire.", "I hear that Esquire Meepers took it upon herself to dance through the first dance at the reception of the newlywed Rose couple. Doesn't she know that you always always wait for an invitation from the couple before stealing their spotlight?", "Lady Georgianna has been consistently having socials. People rave about what a great success they they have been and how much fun they've provided for everyone in the city. Way to get people involved and interacting!", "It's said Georgianna is a kind and gentle Lady, and a stellar example of how Nobility should carry themselves. She tries to educate the commoners in what the Nobility is doing for them, and works hard to organize much-needed regular gatherings to promote open conversation and peaceful relations between those of good standing and the ranked in the city.", "Baron Edmond is said to have spent his entire coin pouch and then some at Lady Aria's auction for the needy, without a thought or care save for his proclaimto do all he could for charity. Truly there's a Noble heart inside this Noble Baron.", "Mister Sattar was seen butting into a conversation between a Noble Lord and Lady in the cafe at a casual social gathering recently, without first politely requesting and awaiting the attention of the one he sought to speak with. That's rather obtrusive behavior for someone of no rank, and people took notice.", "Lord Adrien has been helping the Bisclavret reform and grow stronger by acting as an advisor and friend to the current Ambassador of the House, Dame Anne. How very gracious of him, considering that he only recently arrived to the city.", "I hear mister Kaine offered to watch Meepers' kitten for a few hours. What self-respecting man would volunteer to watch a child that isn't his own? Doesn't he have the man parts to say that's a job for women?", "A Noble invests in the Sailors Guild - that, at least, would be somewhat reasonable, but to actually take over the guild directly? The guild of sometimes honest (usually not) sailors, smugglers, dockside petty criminals -- the home of the basest born? It's disgraceful for a Noble to publicly and officially run such a guild, as it's such roles that differentiate common born and Noble born.", "Scandalous! A member of the clergy is said to have caught mister Virendra urinating on a potted plant inside of the church itself! You don't need to be a genius to figure out the offense in that.", "Miss Nan was recently seen cleaning up the seamstress shop's large collection of clothing for the poor. Rumor has it that it was a terrible mess, and that she's been sorting it into outfits and bags for the needier to more easily rummage through. How thoughtful and selfless of her.", "Oh no! It seems miss Fergie has stopped writing back to her customers, even after they have sent multiple inquiries about orders, and regardless of their rank. They seem to be genuinely upset about their poor treatment.", "Miss Madalina was seen sneaking up to her room with a man she'd just met after she gave him a hefty sum of money. Have to wonder what she's up to now, don't you?", "T'he Doloreaux seem to be pleased with mister Cullan, who, despite not being a part of their house, took it upon himself to escort Dame Katrina safely to her destination.", "People are saying that mister Virendra tried to kill mister Auron after he was finished mutilating the corpse of miss Servita. Truly, this man's evil knows no bounds!", "When it was suggested by Baron Edmond that Master Ekalah perhaps join the Avoirdupois, he showed great loyalty and dedication to the Bisclavret, politely declining, but thanking for the offer. Wouldn't it be nice if all house servants acted similarly?", "Whlie Bekka is much-loved, people are starting to complain about her constantly sleeping in the commons. Not only is it inappropriate, but it's distracting to those out and about attempting to do business.", "Sang was asked to sing a song in the tavern, and automatically took to blurting out something involving bastards and incest. The people in attendance, though usually unoffended by even sailor ditties, took offense to his random selection and continue to talk about how inapprorpiate the wording was.", "I didn't know miss Bekka could heal, but apparently she can! She was quite helpful in recently assisting mister Kaine with some of his injuriese. So, if you can't find a proper medic or Doctor, you know who to turn to.", "Mister Kafka was overheard offering to teach someone else pickpocket in the commons. Doesn't he know that criminal professions are meant to be practiced and learned in secret? Jeesh.", "Lots of complaints against mister Auron recently, I almost don't know where to begin! For starters, they say that he begged miss Bekka for tons of teacher resources, and then after receiving some training, he guild quit without any forewarning, conversation, or plan and renegged on his contract. Aside from that, he was said to be presumptuous and rude to Lady Aria and reportedly almost blinded mister Joey in a practice duel. On multiple occasions when given the opprotunity to learn safety procedures, he showed callousness for the well-being of others, declining or disregarding the need for safety altogether. And now they say he's in the Rinaldi .. my, but I wonder if they know what they have on their hands.", "Did you hear that Xena was attacked?  Yeah!  Fyros went out and found the attacker, dispatching her in the process!  Ensuring the safety of other Rinaldi and protecting the general population is commendable!", "Did you hear? It sounds like Brenner and Xena patched up their differences after she was attacked! Brenner conducted himself honorably, helping to hunt down her assailant, taking care of the attacker's mangled corpse, and even standing guard outside the infirmary. Man. That's a good guy.", "When Xena was attacked in the commons, Noire was the first to react to her call for help!  If my wife is to be believed, the paladin dragged Xena from the commons and sought out a constable.  How utterly deserving of our praise!", "When Xena was the victim of assault, Aria visited her bedside to guarantee she was safe and well-protected.  When the Lady was told she shouldn't be in the area where the actual bloodshed occurred, she replied, 'A member of my House has been attacked .. where else in the world should I be?\\"  She's truly a loving and caring woman, a stellar example of nobility.", "Doing your job is something you're paid to do.  But Auron goes the extra league with his wit, charm, and general affability.  Especially when it comes to Xena and making her feel comfortable after she has been stabbed a few times.  Good chap that.", "People are starting to clamor about Presbyter Ximen not following the example of St. Helloise at all and only winning converts to the Light by instilling fear. Perhaps practicing some love, sacrifice, and charity would benefit him.", "Miss Lia stepped up and put another person before herself, making sure to heal Virendra and ensure his wounds were properly tended after his branding. Another example of a good healer doing a good job.", "Master Ekalah has taken to teaching a few individuals the basics of smithing, and I hear he even lets them help in the crafting of blades for his orders. How nice of him to share his knowledge with those less educated in metalworking, and to give hands-on experience also!", "Miss Bekka seems to be doing quite well with her guild and employees. Despite people thinking she wouldn't be able to successfully run an organization, she's pulled it off, and really helped out individuals who are new to town or uncertain about where exactly they belong.", "Say whatever you want about Rhea, but she helped to arrest Chinco, and that's enough to put her in a lot of peoples good books.", "Despite how he usually is, mister Kafka stepped up to the plate and assisted in arresting Chinco. The Constables seem pretty pleased with him, at least for the time being.", "I hear miss Lia did a fantastic job of patching up Reeve Xena after she was attacked by an assassin. They say the slave saw to the wounds with incredible professional and speed. If only all the healers were so polished.", "Captain Brenner guarded the infirmary to make sure Reeve Xena was safe and protected after the assassin attack on her. What a swell guy he is, looking over someone who isn't in his House and who he doesn't even seem to like.", "I hear mister Virendra helped capture Luciano after he beat up Deputy Zaria! Who says heretics can't still be heroes?", "Apparently miss Bekka pounced on Luciano's shoulders from somewhere high up and unseen, stabbing him in an effort to aid the Constabulary with his arrest. Criminals beware, there's some ferocity in that little package of a woman.", "Did you hear? Silkar performed an impressive shoulder slam against Luciano when he beat up Deputy Zaria and threatened to hold her hostage. He must have been low on catnip or something, to care about anything besides his next fix.", "Resisting arrest for a pickpocketing charge? One has to wonder how it was even worth it..", "Despite being far less skilled than Luciano, Deputy Zaria fought valiantly to bring him in when he resisted arrest. Them Constabulary members aren't the sorts to back down from a bully!", "Apparently mister Luciano has taken to stealing again, this time from miss Bekka. Don't you know that if you're gonna rummage in someones pockets, you have to be good enough to not get caught?", "Once again, Hush has spent her own money to restock stolen items from the infirmary, including pastes, salves, splints, canes, and crutches. How many other Doctors or healers in the city could or would do the same?", "Mister Virendra seems to have gained some ire for referring to the Rinaldi position of Maggiordomo as a 'slutty handmaiden'. Worse, he made it a point to share this disrespect of mister Edwardo and the Rinaldi with Lord Twyrch of the Bisclavret. A heretic judging other people, what's next?", "Apparently Physician Suavis thinks he's now an advisor to Nobility, and was recently heard criticizing Lord Twyrch for his choice in allies. Judging someone far above your own station never leads to anything good.", "I hear a man named Snortimeir barged into the cafe, squealed a rude greeting at a noble, and then proceeded to EAT a tuatara off of the floor. How disgusting and disrespectful can a person get, honestly?", "Mister Kafka was recently heard proclaiming that he could best everyone in the commons with both his hands missing, while wearing soiled pants. Likely it wouldn't have been a comment worthy only of an eye roll if Sir Bayard and Lord Adrien both hadn't been in the room. Such sorts of statements are inappropriate in the presence of Nobility.", "It might be a Doctor's job to help, but Jahren goes the extra mile. When someone was wounded to the point of being blind recently, he helped walk her upstairs, leaving the middle of a conversation to do so and abandoning the wait for his fiance. That he took the time to ensure his patients safety shows just how caring an individual he is.", "Mister Kafka has really stepped over the line lately, accusing the Avoirdupois of heresy, Lord Edmond of forging documents, and the Lords of the Bisclavret of corwardice. How does an embassy manage or choose to suffer someone with such a loose tongue?", "While mister Kafka might have a loose tongue, he was good enough to approach Captain Prideaux with Sir Twyrch, and apologize to him for the accusations against him and House Avoirdupois. Always remember it's never too late to say you're sorry!", "Despite a man being rude to Lia in the infirmary, she informed him that she took an oath to heal everyone, and went about doing her job. It's gotta be hard helping people who don't want or appreciate your aid, but it's pretty admirable to have a healer who will persist and ensure they're treated anyway.", "Mister Kafka is rumored to have been throwing around accusations that the Avoirdupois murdered a gazelle. I bet he's in some deep water with his house nobility and commanding officers for speaking out against another embassy in that fashion.", "People are raving about Lady Georgianna's sweet shop socials, saying they're full of fun for everyone. If you like tea, pie, and wheee, you should definitely look into attending.", "Rumor has it that Snortimeir literally tried to eat people. Nom nom nom? Who says cannibalism has gone out of style?", "What a courageous girl miss Rosaline is! She managed to evade being eaten by the most gigantic boar ever seen, and yet, instead of fleeing, she remained in harm's way to help tend the wounded people that defended her. Now there's a way to show your appreciation!", "People ramble that Snortimeir is a maniac with a bottomless pit of a stomach. I hear he even went so far as to try to eat other people, and in the commons in front of S'allumer and everyone no less! Call the Constables, and let's get this one under lock and key!", "Miss Lia was helpful in alerting the Bisclavret about a member of their House that had been causing some pretty serious problems; thus, helping to maintain the house's good standing in the city. I bet Sir Althalus would be proud of her thoughtfulness.", "Unbelievable! Mister Kafka asked if he could smoke in the presence of a Lady. How respectful not to assault a noble nose without first asking. There might be some hope for him yet!", "Mister Kafka seems to be more mindful as of late, even thinking to apologize when he forgot to bow to Sir Althalus. Perhaps the Bisclavret are taming him after all.", "Not only did Lord Samstag sponsor Clover LePlow for promotion, but he was prudent in making sure the lands weren't too close to the Avoirdupois border. Giving lands near his family estates was especially meaningful and will undoubtedly lead to reinforced ties. Safe to say everyone involved was well pleased with the arrangement, and his house should be proud of him.", "People gossip that mister Clover's swims and friendly attitude do well to maintain high spirits in the city. I wonder just what those swims involve that make them so enjoyable..", "Lord Adrien corrected his guardsman, Kafka, who was being lecherous towards Dame Aeryn in the commons. Yay for Nobles who know how to keep their servants in line.", "Lady Aria gave some sound advice to Maggiordomo Edwardo on how to approach a courtship with Sir Brumble's daugther, Una. She was patient and calm in pointing out his mistakes and further informed him what he needed to do to recover from his blunders. It's just like a Noble to show good leadership while discussing delicate matters.", "I hear miss Carolyn has been asking some of the local smiths for steel to gift to that heretic, Virendra. What gall she has thinking anyone would want to help him acquire anything!", "Word's getting out that Master Ekalah overcharges for the smithing items he makes. Apparently the majority of crafters agree, and all charge less for the same items than he does. It just ain't right for him to be taking advantage of people like that.", "Lia has been busy tending to her house duties, and writing scrolls to her owner, Sir Althalus, for the importation of plants. It's a good thing people can go to someone to get in touch with the Doloreaux nobility, or likely there wouldn't be any communication with them at all.", "Captain Kaine took it upon himself to help move furniture and refused to accept payment for the good deed. The Bisclavret sure do house some chivalrous individuals.", "When Luciano tried resisting arrest, mister Fyros had the mind to block off the alley so he couldn't escape. Good thinking, and way to help the Constabulary.", "A docktowner, and a boss in particular, shouldn't be out helping the Constables, especially fighting the employee of another boss. Talk about a big no-no! I hope nothing worse comes of it than these rumors.", "Mister Ilo has been very polite and helpful to newcomers, and even Lord Blackburne. I hear miss Bekka had a specific job she needed doing very badly, and he managed to hire someone into the guild capable of doing it. From watching boxes to recruiting, Ilo is on the rise!", "After Doctor Hush's call for a thief to return stolen items from the infirmary, Sir Twyrch dipped into his own pocket and time to produce a new set of cabinets for the city's use, and even arranged for a tinkerer to bring in locks to secure everything. How generous is the Nobility of Triskellian!", "Rumor has it that Fyros saved Ilo from an attacker, and has been helpful in teaching him new skills. Aww, to be the hero of a weasel.", "I hear miss Aradhyl is a natural healer. She helped others in the infirmary to heal Ilo, stepping right in and asking how she could assist without being squeamish or afraid to learn at all.", "The Nobles have been gossiping about how kind and generous Clover is, even giving a sample from an impromptu picnic to Lady Georgianna after hearing her social had gone largely unattended. Ain't it something when people look outside themselves to make some someone else's day better?", "A formerly filthy sailor, causing fights, mayhem, and havoc turning over his soul to S'allumer and his teachings? Truly an impressive change in one's lifestyle. It just goes to show that anyone can be touched by the Light if they open themselves up to it!", "Mister Kafka is still at his old ways, making scenes in public and bad-mouthing everyone with his crude talk. He really needs to shape up and get with it if he plans on keeping his job in the Bisclavret.", "Trying to eat innocent people? That's a monstrous thing, no matter who you are, or how big a stomach you have to fill! Triskellian isn't a barbaric land! People work to earn a living here to feed themselves. Really, mister Snortimeir needs to accustom himself to where he is, or go back to wherever he came from.", "Not only did Damara disrupt a conversation between another woman and a Constable, she did it only to be rude. At least if you're gonna impose, do it with a purpose!", "*tisk tisk* I hear Fyros got Deputy Zaria high on catnip and impaired her ability whilst on duty. How utterly irresponsible of him.", "Guess what? I heard Deputy Zaria was high on catnip whilst on duty in the commons. It's no wonder the Constables can't arrest people successfully half the time, what with them lounging around impaired.", "Miss Dazrene was said to have generously offered to give a girl new to town some of her clothing, despite the woman protesting that a seamstress could make her something suitable. How very charitable, though one has to wonder how well the clothes actually fit.", "Apparently mister Fyros showed open disdain for a language being spoken after it was made clear that the people involved were unable to converse otherwise. Triskellian is a melting pot of cultures, so it's no wonder that his intolerance is being met with displeasure.", "Master Ekalah generously offered to compensate miss Dazrene for a gown she gifted to a young woman who couldn't speak Calabrese. He also sought to aid the young miss in better understanding everyone around her. I bet the city would be a much more peaceful place if people behaved in a similar manner as he.", "Guess who was stumbling around dead drunk in the commons, approaching people he didn't know without permission, and announcing his affiliation with the Bisclavret? That's sad it only took you one guess. Yep, mister Kafka. It surely doesn't look well upon the House for one of their guardsmen to behave so poorly.", "I hear mister Cullan is still inviting women up to his room unchaperoned, even though he's supposedly married. Talk about shameful!", "Nobles of other Houses are commending Lady Aria for her good judgment of character in hiring miss Aradhyl. They say the Lady's companioni s respectful of Nobles, courteous and helpful, and thus does her Lady a great credit.", "Despite old age and weakening muscles, mister Dylan offered to help Leorory clear the rubble in the commons caused by the recent whirlwinds that attacked.", "More people are commending the aged mister Dylan for helping to repair the ground in the commons that was broken up by the whirlwinds. Apparently being old and still active is a great feat.", "While people were clearing the rubble in the commons from the whirlwinds, miss Aradhyl played them music, brought drinks to whet their lips, and made an attempt to clear up debris despite wearing fancy garments. What a multi-tasker that miss is!", "Deputy Zaria helped to repair the broken ground caused by the whirlwinds. Her vitality and eager willingness to aid with repairs were greatly appreciated and useful.", "Miss Aradhyl might night have been able to lift the rocks to repair the streets from the cyclone damage, but she did what she could, bringing drinks and playing music for the workers to keep their spirits up.", "People continue to commend Deputy Zaria for aiding Leorory in fixing the ground in the commons damaged by the cyclones. She is said to have worked very hard, steadily lifting heavy rock and debris.", "Did you know that Kafka doesn't like to bathe?  He stinks quite literally.  You would think a member of the Bisclavret would be held to higher expectations.  Not to mention pride in his appearance!", "Virendra is a heretic who can still do good things!  He went after Luciano after for beating up Zaria, even breaking the criminal's nose and getting him to jail!  Wonder what the church thinks about that.", "When offered trade goods worth quite a bit, Adrien refused the gift and insisted that the seller receive goods and services of equal value!  That's surprisingly honorable of him!", "That Kafka isn't afraid to tell you what other gentlemen are up to.  'Goin' ter wank one' is probably not something that needs to be announced.  Especially when hand gestures are involved.", "Donating to the poor and the church is good!  Dylan does that.  Especially if those fabrics aren't worth selling.  Now I know why the poor stay poor.", "I heard that Lennox knows how to woo a girl.  Sending flowers.  Giving escort.  That boy is a real gentleman already!", "Even after he was told that he couldn't help the Rinaldi help bandits, Virendra offered to send mercenaries and guards to help!  That's pretty swell of him wanting to contribute for no personal gain!", "Xena is such a brave and proper citizen!  She led an expedition to fight off evil bandits!", "Ilo is a dirty weasel!  Apparently he went into the sewers and then came to the commons and washed himself at the fountain in the commons!  Other people use that for other purposes, thank you!", "Xena is incredibly brave to be undertaking an expedition and risking herself to rescue a missing man.  Here courage in inspiring!  So are her hips.", "Despite being disrespectful to his social superiors and the law, Kafka can be a man and admit he's made mistakes!  Asking for forgiveness is a good thing.", "Brie takes time out of her busy schedule of... whatever it is she does around town to make sure he customers are extra satisfied!  If only I received that kind of service at the Maison!", "Aradhyl can be a little trickster.  She tried to trick Xena into going to a social with Fyros at the request of her Lady, then acting like a child when Xena disagreed!  Just who does she think she is?", "Healer and .. seamstress? Apparently so! Miss Lia was recently said to have helped in outfitting one of the Bisclavret guard out of the kindness of her heart. Truly, such a talented slave should be appreciated.", "Lady lo Bianco is said to have gifted out one of the most splendid gowns recently to Lady Georgianna in an effort to thank her for her efforts in throwing the Sweet Shop socials. Her kindness hasn't gone unnoticed, nor her own effort to promote Rinaldi fashion.", "Lady Georgianna has been most proactive lately in attempting to hold socials and events to engender interest in the embassies within the City. She's a great example of how Nobles should engage with others inclusively.", "Lord Adrien was most generous in donating troops to the Rinaldi bandit expedition. He set a very good example of how a guest should behave by committing his own men to retrieve an individual not even of his own Household. The respect he has shown to the Rinaldi is something to be acknowledged, and his generosity commended.", "The Baron most thoughtfully gifted a rapier to Lady Aria before the bandit expedition to ensure she had some method of protection should she need it. Not only did he have one custom made, but he had enough forethought to do it in Rinaldi colors. What a generous and fashionable man!", "Paladin Noire and Guardmsna Kafka were said to having an argument in the commons, when mister Claton took it upon himself to get involved and punch the Guardsman! While it might not be right to shout at a representative of the Church in that manner, it's also not right to get violent in public or stick your nose into business that doesn't conern you.", "Miss Lia took it upon herself to console Master Zeiss over the death of his wife, Temperance. That she would be so caring and considerate, slave or not, is commendable.", "The commoners are clamoring over miss Aradhyl, who seems to think that the working class aren't worth being polite to despite them having an obvious place in the city and society. It's important to remember that just because you work for a Lady doesn't mean that she can protect you from everything, least of all gossip.", "Do you know that miss Nan? I hear she has become a paragon of middle class values, and that her clothing craftsmanship is always excellent. She has recently been displaying a much better understanding of propriety, and has been helpful in organizing things for and with the Rinaldi's Lady Aria.", "Talk about surprising! I heard miss Aradhyl was chatting with others recently about being in a harem, and was overheard by people who thought it less than honorable considering her position.", "Miss Aradhyl was said to have accused Fyros of stealing her money pouch as he sat next to her in the middle of the commons. She didn't even stop to think that nobody else had witnessed the removal of the object, nor did she ask. Wrongful accusations can make for sticky situations, indeed.", "Did you hear? Captain Carlon was said to have had a spat with Reeve Xena in the commons over house things, and they were speaking as if they had just broken up. If that wasn't embarrassing enough, for some reason loin rubbing was mentioned. Just what exactly is going on in the Rinaldi these days?", "Captain Carlon was overheard making a lewd joke in the middle of the commons. In response to one man telling another man 'he's fast', the Captain replied that 'That's what the Ladies of the Maison tell me'. Funny or not, it's definitely not something to say in front of another House's noble.", "With very little regard for the reputations of people involved, Fyros persists upon insisting that he knows the truth about Captain Carlon and miss Dazrene's rumored relationship, despite the fact that he has been told otherwise.", "I heard miss Dazrene falsley accused Fyros of lying and spreading rumors about an imagined relationship between the Captain Carlon and herself, losing her temper near explosively in the commons and dragging Fyros off to yell at himi about some disagreement she was having with the what Reeve Xena may or may not have known. Seems someone is of the opinion that she attacks the wrong targets with her anger, one-sidedly refuses to hear any information about a situation other than her own, and rejects that she might not know everything.", "I hear mister Geradan complained about the plan to deal with the bandits the entire length of the expedition. Isn't that something you usually do beforehand?", "Bantering is one thing, but Kafka was witnessed talking to a lass in the commons, asking for a kiss while saying he tasted like candy and indicated his groin. This is another perfect example of what not to do in public, and how not to be if you've any inclination of climbing the social ladder.", "Master Ekalah recently took time to do a rush order for Doctor Hush, managing to make excellent quality shields that she desperately needed. He didn't complain once, nor did he charge anything extra for the hurry. Maybe those rumors about him being overpriced and selfish aren't true at all ..", "Geradan waited until the last minute to worry about the bandit expedition strategy, and then when he was told about it he stated he was only there to put the pointies in the bandits anyway. If you have nothing to do with a strategy in the first place, and then have no intention of following a strategy anyway, then why ask about it at all?", "I heard during the bandit expedition that mister Cullan butted into a conversation between Geradan and Reeve Xena that had nothing to do with him. After he interjected he apparently didn't know the answers to the questions being asked anyway, so it was merely pointless rudeness. He really should learn to keep his comments to himself unless someone is speaking to him.", "Those who went on the bandit expedition are cheering mister Ramsford for his preparedness. Apparently he anticipated the needs of others, and gave out blankets and food to those who failed to bring warmth and sustenance along.", "More people speak about how mister Ramsford mingled with all those present during the bandit expedition, and took to mothering everyone by handing out provisions to those who forgot bits and pieces, including blankets and pillows.", "Woo .. I heard Geradan rudely told Captain Carlon and Captain Brenner to shut up during the bandit expedition, instead of asking them simply to be respectful so people nearby could pray. There's a right way to do things and a wrong way.", "I guess Geradan took it upon himself to repeatedly interrupt the war council as they were finalizing the plans for the attack on the bandits. Many of the people present weren't too appreciative of all the noise and rudeness.", "Lieutenant Sunta is being praised for taking time away from her troops during the bandit expedition to make sure Lady Aria was properly schooled with pointers on how to use her rapier for the battle. It's never too late to get an education!", "Paladin Noire took time to say a prayer before the bandit attack, despite Geradan causing a ruckus with unnecessary comments. It's a good thing the Church has someone capable of representing them in a positive light.", "I hear Lady Aria gave quite the motivational speech on the bandit expedition in an effort to bolster the spirits of the troops. There's nothing like a good string of words to get the blood flowing!", "Sir Bayard is being commended for his ability to stay on top of his men during the bandit expedition, who were undoubtedly some of the most well-disciplined in attendance and most prepared for battle.", "Captain Carlon did an excellent job of guiding and directing the Rinaldi troops during the bandit expedition. They seemed to be kept in order and were constantly listening to his commands.", "More gossip about Geradan and the bandit expedition! I'm told he made quite the scene when people attempted to set up a barricade, even challenging Kafka to a duel. Talk about the least inappropriate time to do something of that nature, really.", "When the men on the bandit expedition started acting stupidly and began arguing amongst themselves, Sir Bayard is said to have utilized his Lieutenants swiftly to quell the problem, much to everyone's relief.", "It was acknowledged during the bandit expedition that when given orders from other House's Nobles, Lieutenant Sunta continued to act swiftly and without argument, just as any good soldier should.", "I'm told Doctor Hush did a brilliant job of handling the healers on the bandit expedition, setting up camp in preparation of the onslaught, and healing injured friends and others throughout the chaotic event.", "I'm told Lia did a wonderful job of healing others during the bandit expedition, despite being seriously wounded herself. On top of that, she was the only who could manage to calm Geradan whenever he started causing a ruckus, which is a job in and of itself.", "Miss Bekka took to healing during the bandit expedition, patching up the assassin squad led by Fyros after the battle. I hear she turned out to be a surprisingly good fighter, as well, assisting them to be victorious over the enemy.", "During the bandit expedition, miss Bekka was said to have taken a lickin', but kept on tickin'. She got knocked down quite a few times by the enemy, but continued to get up and press onward, even to the point of saving her companions in the process.", "People are swooning over the keen eyes of Ramsford. During the bandit expedition, his perceptiveness is said to have led to the deaths of several disciplined mercenaries who attempted a surprise attack in the woods on Fyros' team of assassins.", "Guess Clover has taken to using foul and irreverant language in the presence of women again, and in a public place, no less. He was said to have been talking about S'allumers balls, and no doubt it had nothing to do with games of any sort.", "Doctor Hush managed to display some very impressive healing skills and even treated people for poison on the spot during the bandit expedition.", "Miss Lia managed to display some very impressive healing skills during the bandit expedition, despite being seriously wounded herself. Hooray for selflessness and determination!", "During the bandit expedition, it's said that mister Ramsford saved Bekka from certain death, and even managed to do it with a dramatic flair. With or without style, putting yourself in harms way for someone else is admirable.", "Captain Brenner fought valiantly during the bandit expedition and assisted Captain Carlon when he became injured during the brawl. He watched the backs of everyone involved in the skirmish, whether he liked them or not. Now that's just good soldiering.", "Say what you want about Lady Aria, but the fact of the matter is she stood bravely beside her troops, despite her rank and lack of training in combat. Her fearlessness is something to be admired.", "Captain Carlon was truly a sight to behold on the bandit expedition. I hear he fought like a crazed beast, and took horrible injuries but refused to give up until he saw the Reeve to safety!", "Captain Carlon acted selflessly, putting his life on the line to defend Reeve Xena against bandits.", "Lieutenant Sunta put her life on the line and fought valiantly during the bandit expedition. It's said that she followed orders promptly and managed to even see to the safety of her Noble, Lady Aria, and the others in attendance.", "Captain Brenner acted selflessly, putting his life on the line to defend Reeve Xena against bandits.", "Sir Bayard brought his troops on the bandit expedition to help rescue a Rinaldi scoutsman, personally assisted in eliminating the bandit thread, and held a commanding attitude throughout which helped give direction to everyone involved in the skirmish.", "Sir Bayard took it upon himself to see to Lady Aria after the bandit bandit battle was concluding and ensured she had a pleasant place to rest and that her wounds were tended to. Nevermind that the pleasant place was in his arms..", "Mister Kafka made a valiant effort to get Lady Aria free from a snare trap during the bandit expedition, risking his own safety to do so. While the Lady didn't completely escape harm, many are convinced that he prevented her from suffering more serious injuries.", "Fyros, with the aid of Bekka and Ramsford, seemed to pull off a successful attempt at flushing out the bandits recently, despite suffering an ambush in the woods. He seems to be a pretty handy fellow to have around.", "Bekka, with the aid of Fyros and Ramsford, seemed to pull off a successful attempt at flushing out the bandits recently, despite suffering an ambush in the woods. She seems to be a good sort of person to have around.", "Ramsford, with the aid of Fyros and Bekka, seemed to pull off a successful attempt at flushing out the bandits recently, despite suffering an ambush in the woods. He seems to be a good sort of person to have around.", "While Bekka might have done a lot of good things during the bandit expedition, I heard she also disobeyed orders and ran about a dangerous area rigged with traps. Consequently, a spike trap got set off that injured many people. It's all fun and games until someone gets hurt!", "During the entirety of the negotiation and bandit conflict, Captain Prideaux kept a level head and listened to the orders he was given. Yay for not stirring the pot.", "Captain Kaine supported Captain Carlon's every word while they dealt with the bandit envoy recently. He knew these hooligans weren't to be trifled with. Isn't that the kind of man everyone wants at their side? A pragmatic one?", "Sir Bayard is certainly a brilliant military mind. Left with the command of the builk of the Houses military forces, he conducted himself admirably. The villains were routed and the casualties were minimal, making the expedition a success on the whole.", "Deft and able, Fyros came charging to the rescue when it seemed the tide was turning against Reeve Xena, and Captains Brenner, Kaine, and Carlon. His quick action may very well have saved all of their lives.", "Deft and able, Bekka came charging to the rescue when it seemed the tide was turning against Reeve Xena, and Captains Brenner, Kaine, and Carlon. Her quick action may very well have saved all of their lives.", "Deft and able, Ramsford came charging to the rescue when it seemed the tide was turning against Reeve Xena, and Captains Brenner, Kaine, and Carlon. His quick action may very well have saved all of their lives.", "Captain Kaine lent his services as Captain to join Reeve Xena in the negotiation process against the bandits. It was a very admirable thing to do.", "Faithful Lieutenant that she is, Sunta conducted herself well in the grueling battle with the bandit forces, despite sustained injuries from cowardly archers in the woods.", "Doctor Hush worked diligently to ensure wounded soldiers were able and fit for battle, despite injuries she herself suffered during the bandit expedition. One can only marvel at her skills, as it's said she even had time in between her healing to light a purple votive candle for Lady Aria.", "Miss Lia worked diligently to ensure wounded soldiers were able and fit to battle during the bandit expedition, despite having taken injuries herself.", "During the bandit battle, Hush was one of the many fine healers providing medical care to the warriors. Through her efforts, people were able to carry on fighting to protect Lady Aria and Reeve Xena.", "Captain Kaine killed many bandits, even engaging the enemy bandit boss and coming out unscathed. That panther is a credit to his House's famous reputation of being deadly on the battlefield.", "Paladin Noire saw to the emotional well-being of the survivors of the bandit fight through prayer and her peaceful presence. This was after she slew many foes, of course.", "For leading the bandit plot and being ever patient with all the players and scenes. Well done!", "Captain Carlon did a good job of leading the Rinaldi during the bandit expedition. He remained ever calm and collected during the chaos.", "Captain Kaine did a good job of leading the Bisclavret during the bandit expedition. He remained ever calm and collected during the chaos.", "Say what you will about Captain Brenner, but on the battlefield he refused to leave a hurt Captain Carlon behind, despite being told to go repeatedly.", "Seems Fyros managed to do a gentlemanly thing and gave Dazrene a discrete heads-up about Captain Carlon's condition after the bandit expedition.", "Some Nobles and commoners agree that Lady Aria was a needless and distracting risk during the bandit expedition. Protecting her was said to draw three or more of the best fighters available from the main battle, and she drew the attention of more than just one healer at any given time. People gossip that the Lady just had no reason to be there, and that she risked the lives of hundreds of men by her presence, not to mention risking her own Reeve and many other men simply for the sake of rescuing a single commoner.", "What a gal that Lia is! I hear she told Geradan to protect Lady Aria during the bandit attack, rather than following and protecting her. What selflessness and sensibility! She sure suffered for it too, getting stabbed, poisoned, and sliced, all while trying to heal other soldiers. Who knows what would have happened if Geradan had abandoned Lady Aria with Mama Borgia Mia heading straight for her?", "Doctor Hush made sure everyone else got looked at first after the bandit expedition before allowing herself to be tended. If that isn't dedication to the job, then I dunno what is.", "Lia was right behind Doctor Hush, making sure everyone else was fixed up after the bandit expedition before bothering with herself. She certainly should be commended by her owner.", "Kafka's repeated attempts to pick a fight with Geradan during the bandit expedition was distracting to those trying to watch for danger, and he made it a point to ignore several attempts by his superiors to get him to stop. Really, there's a time and place for such things.", "While he is indeed trying hard to curve his bad habits, there was no excuse for Geradan's bad behavior toward his superiors at the bandit site. I hear he demanded that Sir Bayard stop talking and even told Lady Aria to mind her own business. Someone still needs to learn his place.", "That Captain Prideaux is the very picture of a gallant Avoirdupois squire! Not only did he risk his life to protect the Rinaldi Reeve and rescue the hostage, sustaining multiple injuries in the process, but he took on dozens of bandits to get Captain Carlon to safety also!", "No wonder Captain Kaine is being named Lord Blackburne's squire! Not only was he involved in planning tactics and strategy for the bandit expedition, but he bravely risked his life to rescue the hostage and protect the Rinaldi Reeve. I hear quite a number of bandits met their end at his hands ...", "Not only is Paladin Noire a pillar of faith and leadership, leading the entire expedition in prayer for the success of the mission, but she also risked her life to save Baron Marcus - twice! Further, she intervened in quite a few arguments between the fighters, managing to break things up peaceably. She should be commended for her efforts.", "Lieutenant Sunta sure is an amazing fighter! Not only dids he organize the building of a defensive barricade around the ally camp, but she continually risked her life to protect the Lady Aria, sustaining multiple injuries in the process.", "That mister Ramsford! Not only did he bring all manner of provisions to support the fighters, he also risked his life as part of the rescue squad to retrieve the Rinaldi Reeve and the hostage! It almost makes up for him foolishly triggering that trap and wounding the already-injured fighters after the battle was over.", "The church ought to be proud of Paladin Khagra. I hear nobody defeated more bandits than he did. Why, he was practically a one-man army, defeating any and all foes who attempted to harm hiim or his allies. Methinks someone deserves a medal, both for risking themself, and for being so good at combat!", "I'm sure all those who went on the bandit expedition were glad Doctor Rose was with them. First she organized the temporary infirmary in the midst of the camp, and then repeatedly risked her life to heal the injured and protect Lady Aria! If it weren't for her, a lot more soldiers would likely have died from poison or blood loss. She ought to be commended.", "I hear that if it weren't for Fyros and the ambush he led, the Reeve Xena and that hostage would have never made it out alive! His team killed one of the bandit leaders, and wounded and killed dozens of other bandits! Someone definitely proved their worth in battle, and should be rewarded for it.", "That Captain Carlon! Seriously wounded in the line of duty, and yet he still managed to take on dozens of bandits before he was felled! Someone deserves a medal!", "Despite Doctor Hush not feeling well herself, she is still taking the time to follow up with and ensure that everyone from the bandit expedition is recovering and getting proper treatment.", "That mister Martin sure does seem to have a keen mind. I hear he informed a newcomer on why Triskellian is a trade center for the land of Calabria, and continued to display a firm understanding of the purpose of the city, and the relationship between the Houses. If only everyone was so willing to educate new arrivals in the more important aspects of city life!", "Sir Bayard reportedly protected Doctor Hush on her way to healing the injured during the bandit attack. His strength and martial abilities ensured the survival of many allies!", "While Kafka is known to be grouchy, he took it upon himself to argue with Geradan due to stress during the bandit expedition. He was asked multiple times to stop arguing and literally had to be threatened before he would stop fighting with his own allies.", "Cavalier Bayard may be good in battle, but he's reportedly poor at running a Household. He's apparently cracking the whip in regards to house trading, and taken his entire Household to task over what they import, and how they spend their coin, calling the rich wines and the lush fabrics that are so symbolic of the Avoirdupois 'frivolous'. Rumor has it he even took action to try and discipline a Baron of higher standing!", "I hear Lady Aria took to quarreling with Chatelaine Nan in the west commons about social and house ranks, rather than taking the issue somewhere more private and having a calm discussion. Such displays are inappropriate for a Noble.", "How rude! When Lady Aria suggested that a memorial service be held for those who died in the bandit battle, Sir Althalus took it upon himself to write the Lady for permission to host it himself. When she told him that she had already spoken to a Paladin about doing just that and invited him to join the planning, he decided to simply make a public announcement about the one he was hosting himself. Does he have such a need to socially climb that he attempts to usurp already planned events just so that he might have credit?", "Brie made sure that her husband, Ramsford, was prepared for the bandit adventure by providing blankets, pillow, food, and comfortable clothing.  Just like a wife is supposed to.", "Xena doesn't have any problems arguing in the commons with Carlon, acting like they had just broken up and talking about loin rubbing...", "Ramsford likes to mingle when he's out on the road, making sure everyone enjoys the comforts of home!", "Sunta doesn't mind giving fencing pointers to nobles on their first military venture.  It's never too late to get an education in combat with her around.", "Geradan doesn't like to take orders, I hear.  When a group went to find bandits, he complained the entire time about not knowing the plan or giving backtalk to those how had authority over him.  Thank goodness he went along.", "Bayard respectably commanded his troops through the journey to the bandit site and actively engaged in hashing out strategy and plan details with other expedition leaders.", "Fyros managed to seem confident in his portion of the strategy to find bandits, kept his troops updated and informed on their responsibilities, how things should play out, and so on.  He showed really good leadership!", "Despite not being part of a Great House, Bekka volunteered to come on the bandit expedition and was more than willing to fight for the cause, joining a group of assassins.  Grr grr, get the bandits.", "Despite not being part of a Great House, Bekka volunteered to come on the bandit expedition and was more than willing to fight for the cause, joining a group of assassins.", "Aria gave a good, encouraging speech to motivate and uplift the troops fighting to save a Rinaldi man.  It was quite befitting for someone of the nobility to take command and do so.", "Handling the situation with aplomb, Aria kept control of the troops, even though she must be quite nervous about her task.", "Of the three Captains that escorted Xena on her mission, Brenner was the only one to actually listen to and obey her orders.", "Ramsford guarded Xena while she was dragging the hostage from the bandit camp!  He protected her the entire way with little concern for his own well-being.", "Fyros managed to bring reinforcements in the nick of time, burning the bandit camp to aid the Captains and Xena in their retrieval of the hostage Espio.  Now if only I could find a pyromaniac with that kind of dedication.", "Bayard really put himself on the line to save a Rinaldi scout from the bandits!", "Xena was diplomatic and calm during the entire bandit ordeal.  When the fight broke out?  She was determined to save the hostage and work swiftly to cut his bonds!", "After Aria was wounded fighting bandits, Bayard was her blanket.  He cradled her against his chest, ensuring she was warm and felt safe, and was protected.  So chivalrous of him!", "Xena really put herself at risk, offering to be kidnapped by bandits and managing to pull it off without the death of herself or anyone of importance.", "Sunta took a great many injuries during the bandit expedition and ensured the safety of Lady Aria throughout.  What a trooper.", "Xena is modest to a fault when receiving accolades, even if they are in regard to a military victory she was the architect of!", "Xena saw to the comfort and health of all the combatants after the bandit battle.  Awww.  Thoughtful much?", "Hush tended to Xena and anybody else who was injured by bandits.  With care and skill no less.  The fact that she came along when she was clearly against the entire plan was admirable in and of itself.  That's how you get ahead, shut up and keep your head down!", "You know what Auron did?  He strolled right up to Xena after she got back from fighting bandits and asked how his sword was coming along!  Oh sure, he was willing to wait for the work to be done.  But he didn't even bother to say hello, how are you, nothing.  What a pud.", "Sunta Hare with legs up to her hair.", "Lia's a helpful sort of slave.  She doesn't mind taking the time to explain House standards, propriety, the basics of clothing, and even offers to help teach people how to speak Calabrese.  And all this for people who aren't associated with her owner's House!  How great!", "You know what Cullan is good at?  Butting his way into conversations.  During a military expedition no less!  He likes to talk about how he knows what the strategies are, especially when he doesn't know the strategies.  Never you mind shouting to drown out his superiors.", "Kafka is usually pretty insufferable.  Ask anyone.  Even his friends hate him.  But on the bandit expedition, he fought bravely and represented his House well.  Kudos!", "Care packages!  Brie made care packages for the troops going to fight bandits!  Care packages show you care.  Brie must really care.", "Love her or hate her, Xena had the safety of everyone foremost in her mind.  Even the people you think she doesn't care about.  Even when it was clear that the expedition had been deceived she was more focused on negotian than combat.", "Boars need love too.", "Oink, oink.  The other white meat.", "Despite having issues with him, mister Geradan has been most tolerant with mister Kafka and has been kind enough to not bring charges against him out of respect for the Bisclavret. I hear he intends to settle things one-on-one with Kafka rather than making a big to-do out of the whole affair. If I knew what the issue was exactly, I might brag more.", "I hear mister Greeves tried to trick miss Gemma into marriage using a cursed armband, and caused quite the scene due to it. Pretty sad if that's the only way he can get a woman, especially in a city so full of them.", "It seems Deputy Krell has taken to bad-mouthing Presbyter Ximen in public areas. Does the Constabulary have something against the Church all of the sudden, or is this a case of a Constable gone wild?", "After all the trouble that went into getting Chinco arrested, and all the talk about him refusing to lay down his arms when he was told he couldn't have them, the Sheriff failed to even ask mister Chinco to disarm when he took him into the jail proper. Oye, the Constabulary these days.", "Even after losing an honorable duel, mister Ilo refused to hold to the terms of said duel. Everyone knows better than to do that, honorable or otherwise.", "Captain Carlon has recently taken to teaching it seems, busying himself with correcting mister Kafka's behavior in public areas. Most recently, it was said that Kafka was teaching a female bad words in the commons and the Captain called him on it.", "While one can understand standing behind your employees, miss Bekka has taken it to an extreme, choosing to believe in mister Ilo's words rather than in the law, despite several cases being filed against him by the Constabulary alongside whole explanations with reasonings about the crimes that occurred and the consequences thereof.", "Miss Bekka seems to be persistent in harrassing the Constabulary about trying to get mister Ilo to file his testimony, even after repeatedly being told that the law works in a certain way, and individuals can't be proven innocent if they don't speak up for themselves.", "The Lord Baron very wisely called attention recently to the possibility of miss Una witnessing something potentially inappropraite at Baron Edmond's social. I hear the theme was named debauchery, and that it was hardly an event for a young girl's eyes.", "Despite being impaired by her lack of sight and not knowing the names of places, she offered to give miss Nasrin a tour of the city using her limited perception of smell. I'm certain that was quite the interesting tour!", "If you don't want your business heard, it's best not to conduct it around the Newtown courier, as Doctor Hush was said to be doing. Apparently a Noble took offense to her whispering and instructing her fellow cohorts to do the same while in the Noble's presence. Quite a rude and tactless display, especially when followed by leaving without so much as asking for leave or excusing yourself.", "I hear Doctor Hush offered cash prizes for the treasure hunt out of her very own pocket and was donating all the proceeds from the silent auction straight to charity. How generous of her!", "It seems rather high-handed of Captain Kaine to go around claiming Deputy Zaria as part of his Household. The Constables of a Rinaldi city are to remain unaffiliated with Households in order to do their duty neutrally and without bias. I hope he doesn't make her look bad to her superiors!", "What is with mister Chesh? Just read the case file on him and you'll see that not only did he threaten to assassinate and outright attack a Noble, but he also insulted the Constabulary while he was doing it! Really, just who raised this man? He's not going to last very long in town if he continues with this kind of behavior.", "Poor weasel, always being talked about. Rumor has it that he was stuck between filing testimony on his own behalf, and upholding the terms of an honorable duel. I hear he did his best to figure out a way to help explain his situation without breaking the terms of his agreement, and in the end, he decided to withhold testimony on his own behalf just to be sure he didn't say anything wrong. It's a pretty swell guy that will go to jail just to be sure he doesn't dishonor himself.", "While Chinco may be a well-known criminal and stubborn to boot, he did finally give up his weapons to the Constabulary. Is he simply afraid of losing his handsome head, or is he finally taking a step in the right direction? Hard to tell with that one.", "Mister Virendra certainly isn't the sharpest tool in the barn. So quickly after getting that brand on his forehead, he seems to be up to his old habits again. Implicated for murder? Another murder he was convicted for? I don't think that brand taught him anything at all.", "Miss Nan apparently agreed to provide the Constabulary with a list of which person was wearing what mask to the Avoirdupois social gathering. She aimed to keep the list private, but also ensure that nobody was able to do anything rotten while disguised. Everyone should be commending her for both her discretion and her concern for public safety.", "While Biggs has been left in charge of the Constabulary, he is rarely available for business, never answers his scrolls, and doesn't take the time to properly induct Deputies. Why, I hear Zaria has been working for the Constabulary for moons, and was never even told the first thing about her job!", "Did you hear? Lord Adrien allowed the slave, Lia, to act as the representative of the Doloreaux embassy at the Bisclavret social. Talk about inappropriate!", "Lord Adrien was said to have given a very inspiring speech at the Bisclavret social that encouraged unity amongst the four Houses.", "Some of the Nobility were a tidbit concerned about Lord Adrien's speech at the Bisclavret social. Rumors have it that he encouraged people to gorge themselves on large portions of food and become nearly too drunk to walk home. That sort of encouragement likely isn't what you want to be giving to Nobles, house members, and favored persons of the city, even if done in jest.", "People are raving about what a good shindig Lady Georgianna put on, and are commending her for actually getting senior members from all the Houses to attend. I hear the booze was flowing pretty good too, so that probably helped people's enjoyment of the event.", "Among a Lady, Rinaldi Reeve, various other commoners, and skinks, Lord Adrien chose to dance with a -slave- at his social instead of picking from one of the many other options.", "I understand miss Lia is a particularly friendly slave, but she shouldn't be allowing a Lord to embarrass himself at his own social by taking her to the dance floor before all of the other ranked females.", "Lady Georgianna was a good hostess at the Bisclavret Social. People say she was warm, welcoming, that she chatted with guests, and was generally a pleasure to be around.", "How rude to interrupt two Ladies engaged in conversation. Reports say Lady Georgianna and Lady Aria were discussing the recent flurry of socials at the Bisclavret event, and mister Clover just jumped right in with a topic change. Surely he could have waited until the conversation was concluded.", "Baron Edmond was forced to introduce himself to Willem the Falconer while speaking to Lord Adrien, Lady Georgianna and himself collectively. How rude is that? Nobles should know the rules of courtesy and make introductions accordingly.", "People understood Zaria wanting to shaer her love of the arts at the Bisclavret social, but reciting a poem and expecting folks to be quiet and listen when they were already engaged in other discussions was just too much, especially after Zaria was already told to wait for people to conclude their business. It was rude and inappropriate on the whole.", "Participated in the treasure hunt, and despite having difficulty with a problem, she refused to give up. Stubbornness, at times, can be something to admire.", "That treasure hunt Doctor Hush put on sure sounded like fun! All of it led to a party for charity too, so she was entertaining people and helping out the less fortunate. What a nice woman!", "Rumor has it that Paladin Noire stood silently by when Carolyn returned from the dead and was being taken away from public company by not only a heretic, but someone under suspicion for killing her. Isn't it the Church's job to watch over the faithful and the heretical both?", "When learning of mister Virendra's suspicion of killing miss Carolyn, she didn't hesitate to take up charge concerning the two going off alone.", "Miss Lotis took time out of her own schedule to clearn up the mess left on Market Street by people seeing to mister Ilo. Though such cleaning is the job of slaves, she was quite generous in volunteering and following through.", "Mister Auron was overheard talking about being exposed to the girl he's courting in the middle of the commons! How scandalous, even for Docktown. Keep some of your conversations for private, please.", "It's very Noble of Lia, slave or not, to hold true to her promise to miss Temperance and mister Zeiss, that even after Temperance's death, she continues to make sure Yulien, her child, is still taken care of.", "Captain Kaine assuaged mister Geradan by offering to talk to the Bisclavret Nobles about mister Kafka, who refused Geradan's challenge to duel via scroll. Smart thing that, since it would bring dishonor to the whole House if Geradan had to challenge Kafka more publicly.", "Polgara had a few people go with her to help find something she had lost. Even though they weren't able to find it, she paid the people for helping anyway. Now that's a good woman!", "Lady Aria is ever polite to those in her House, both in greeting them and in ensuring they are kept up to date with what's going on in the embassy.", "Despite past grievances with Sir Matteo, Lord Marcus was kind enough to welcome him back with open arms and a smile. If only everyone was party to such warm reunions.", "For once, mister Geradan took the lawful approach. In dealing with mister Kafka, when constantly goaded and called a heretic, he challenged the guard to a duel and laid out the terms clearly, as written by Mercutio di Rinaldi on the public boards. Handling things appropriately really pays off.", "Mister Kafka not only refused a duel with Geradan, but also accused the paladin of heresy, and sent him a soiled scroll as a finishing touch. Even for a Bisclavret guard, that's hardly appropriate or acceptable behavior.", "Miss Carolyn is apparently very kind. I hear she'll buy and donate things for and to the needy, even going so far as to deliver them into nasty places like the jailhouse just to make sure they are received by the proper party.", "Miss Madaline returned again to the city, and all she could do was shout orders at people to leave her presence. She even snapped at the Rinaldi Reeve, and ordered Guardsman Breeze to arrest mister Ilo for no apparent reason. Who does that woman think she is anyway? The Dona?", "Mister Virendra went into the commons making it a point to announce that he was wearing nothing but a comforter. While skimpy garb is regularly worn in Docktown, turning yourself into a spectacle in a public area to garner attention due to lack of clothing is hardly appropriate.", "When mister Virendra came out into the commons wearing nothing but a comforter, Gentleman Clover started making ribald jokes about Virendra's private bits, and even insinuated that people would want to see them. Aren't ranked members of society supposed to be good examples of behavior?", "Miss Bekka might like to claim her guild is different, but people believe she's just another in a chain of leaders who tries to recruit every single person the moment they step through the city gates rather than give them time to figure out the best direction to take. It might work for some, but others find bad fits and just end up leaving entirely.", "Upon entering the commons, Sir Althalus didn't even bother to acknowledge Lady Aria as protocol dictates. Instead, he simply turned heel and walked the other way! What a rude, curt gentleman.", "When miss Dahlia was desperately in need of kohl for her pagan social costume, mister Brenner didn't hesitate to send it to her in her hour of need. I guess if you need makeup, you know who to beg now.", "Miss Noe is most shrewd when it comes to business dealings. Not only does she have excessive skills with garments and hair, but she is able to skillfully negotiate favors and trade in exchange for said skills. Clearly she's a credit to her household.", "I hear at the pagan social Baron Edmond proclaimed his love for Lady Aria when she was too drunk to comprehend what he was saying. He even took vows with her of some sort while she was in that state. What sort of Noble takes advantage of another in that sort of situation? Shame on him!", "That mister Velasco has absolutely no manners whatsoever! He reportedly harrassed Guardswoman Breeze by placing his hand on her backsside despite her constant protests! He's just lucky it happened in Docktown instead of Newtown, or people would -really- have made an issue out of it. Clearly his lack of respect for women is already being acknowledged.", "For a Squire, she really is representing her Knight disfavorably by hanging around wit hthe excommunicated Harken Zeiss and joking about being killed by his hand in the commons.", "Squire Donatella's name continues to float around the gossip circle as she tries to find excuses to go up to mister Zeiss' rooms. Any girl going up there deserves whatever she gets after all his escapades, but for a Bisclavret Squire to pursue that course of action? Definitely bad form.", "Miss Donatella associates with an excommunicated man, mister Zeiss, and refuses to see how that might reflect on her person and house in a negative way. While the church does approve of people wanting to reach out and help him, she didn't make any mention of how her association with him accomplishes that. Her only justification at all was that, as a merchant, he has wares nobody else does. Sell your soul for a trinket anyone?", "When informed that people were publicly speaking about her relationship with mister Zeiss, miss Omen was quite rude and insisted that she be called Captain even though she possesses no rank whatsoever. She further threatened to take a Constable to task for warning her that her name was being bandied about in association with his.", "Miss Dahlia was wise enough to heed the words of the Constables when saving the life of Doctor Hush. They told everyone who weren't strong swimmers to stay on shore, and she stuck back and kept mister Fips from suffering the same fate as the Doctor.", "Girl fight! I hear miss Aradhyl was flirting inappropriately with mister Fyros in the commons, and in the presence of his suitor, Zaria. She was commenting on the subject of men always trying to get her out of her skirts due to mister Fyros requesting she not wear one while undergoing combat training with him. Did she cross the ilne by being disrespectful or were her words misconstrued out of touchiness? Either way, such jokes aren't for everyone - remember that.", "Despite knowing miss Emma was blind, and despite seeing her dressed only in her undergarments in public, he didn't say a word to her out of care of concern. You'd think such a long-standing member of the Bisclavret would be more of a gentleman and not visually take advantage of the situation.", "Sheriff Biggs rarely replies to scrolls in an acceptable amount of time and claims to do the paperwork that others in the Constabulary do themselves. There were cases that reportedly hadn't been closed for over a year, so those with pending punishments had to deal with them well past the time they should have. Not to mention there are several recruits of over a month waiting to be brought into the guard itself because the Sheriff has just been too lazy to get to it. All in all, he makes for a terrible person for that particular position, or so they're saying. Step it up, man, show them what you can do!", "When Doctor Hush took ill with poison, Dylan used his limited skills to the best of his ability to identify the problem and help deal with it.", "Now folk in Docktown like a good a good brawl and don't really mind Constables getting a little taste of their own medicine, but if you're going to draw weapons, you should at least have some excuse more than boredom.", "Volunteering to second Ilo in a duel and teach him the rules of it so he could handle it honorably. Apparently she has her own moments of honor as well.", "Ilo always seems to be in the midst of trouble, usually involving weapons, and then complains about it later. What did he expect when Jarek was already attacking Fyros and he accused Fyros of an attack in the sewers with no evidence by a vague memory of a dagger. He refused to press charges. He refused to stop, and when he was challenged to a duel over it, he complained about that too.", "After a long day of duels, brawls, fights and other nonsense, Doctor Hush tended the assorted injuries without complaint and without seeking coin. She spent hours at her labors. Healers can be so underappreciated.", "You never know what to expect from those new to town, but Aster did well helping out a bunch of wounded in the infirmary and having a gentle touch with Zaria. She made sure everyone was okay until a more experienced healer showed up.", "Let her employee draw blade and pick a fight for no real reason in the commons without trying to stop him, even drawing blade to defend him if it came to it. That's taking responsibility for your employees' actions.", "Apparently a lot of people noticed Jarek's unsolicited violence against the wounded Zaria and then to her defender when Fyros stepped in. If you're going to attack people out of the blue, at least try and do it in an alley or the Docks. That's almost what they're for.", "Xena, the fine Rinaldi aristocrat dueled Ilo on behalf of Fyros's honor with the terms that Ilo would recant his accusations about Fyros' attack. Fighting on behalf of another's honor can be honorable in it own right and suited to someone of station, or she must really feel something for Fyros to protect him so. You be the judge.", "She did her job well and worked to save a number of people while keeping good cheer the night of the Daemon constellation.", "Best be careful of that Fyros, he'll act like your friend but he'll still turn on you and even try to kill you in an instant. Watch your back, specially in the dark.", "Doctor Hush really put a lot of work into her Treasure Hunt in order to make fun for the participants.", "Captain Kaine realizes that a leader worries about every single person under his command. He regularly visited the infirmary to check on wounded guards and troops, including Tork.", "Breeze is a good and fair constable, appreciated for her thoughtfulnes and investigating accusations rather than just rushing ahead blindly with each one.", "Lady Georgianna was very considerate during the Bisclavret social to provide non alcoholic drinks for those of gentler disposition or sensibilities.", "Lord Adrien's speech at the Bisclavret social reinforced the sentiment which is often forgotten, the importance of the Houses working and coming together.", "Zaria was thoughtful enough to bring some Bisclavret poetry to their cultural social and recite it.", "Lady Georgianna's complaints that her husband doesn't hire chefs and cooks, but rather requests to only eat gruel and porridge would have been a minor comment, if only she hadn't said it to others of station who took note and raised eyebrows.", "Did you see the clothing Gemma was wearing at the Bisclavret banquet? Sharing your culture is one thing, but dressing like a Maison worker is another.", "Lord Edmond took the time to give Paladin Noire a dancing lesson during a social so that she might be more prepared for such events in the future.", "Captain Kaine escorted Lady Aria and Xena safely back to their rooms when no others were present to do so. It was especially thoughtful considering Xena was inebriated and could have easily fallen to harm without a guard nearby.", "It was quite thoughtful of Xena to suggest that the leftover food  from the Bisclavret social be donated to the poor.  We should always be thinking of those less  fortunate than ourselves.", "Yes, we get it you want people to know you're in looooove, but Auron really should have a little discretion. All the cuddling and touching right out in the commons is too much, but kissing Olena while folk are passing by is a bit much.", "Olena should really stop letting Auron snuggle, grope and kiss her right out in the commons in front of everyone all the time. Its not the place.", "Sang played incredibly well with a multitude of instruments for the Bisclavret social, From Bagpipes to a harpsichord, he can play it all with perfection.", "Fyros helped Doctor Hush with her treasure hunt, giving an especially interesting math problem for people to solve.", "For giving her money free to someone she knew very little about! The youngest daughter of thirteen never had much for herself, so Brie was very generous to treat Nasrin like so.", "Fyros is ever respectful and courteous.  While his position is that of personal body guard to the Lady Grazia, he always looks out not only for the members of his House, but for everyone in the town as well.  His brusque demeanor hides a deep loyalty to those around him. He even sacrificed his entire savings to help finance part of the expedition against the bandits.", "What a fool, goin to the jail peacefully woulda earned him some good words for his benefit, but instead he turns and attacks Zaria. The Bisclavret must be ashamed.", "Licking on Carolyn's ear in public, and inviting himself up to her room when she mentioned she was going to go upstairs and work on clothing for someone. Rude, and oh so naughty!", "Sir Matteo approached Xena about some rumors he heard regarding her, and was seemingly genuine in his concern about her happiness with the Household. It was a different Matteo than the one from years past who blabbed everyone's business to anyone who would listen.", "At risk to his own life, Fyros swam out into the riptide to save Doctor Hush from drowning a death on the bottom of the ocean.", "Despite being teased and flirted with by Fyros and Zaria together, she didnt get angry and throw a fit. She just asked to leave respectfully. She was challenged to act up and passed, she really is handling herself well lately.", "Kaine escorted Xena all the way back to her room because of her inebriation at Fyros' request. What a gentleman. Now the Rinaldi reeve being so drunk she repeatedly needs an escort to her rooms is another matter.", "Whispers say that Lady Aria and Baron Edmond have been going into one another's rooms without proper chaperones. While they have largely been successful in avoiding rumors altogether through discretion, this time they were caught by a sneaky Paladin who brought up the inappropriateness of the situation right in the middle of the commons, and in front of another Noble no less! Rule of thumb: If you're of station and don't want scandal surrounding you, don't enter a private room with someone of the opposite gender unless there's a third party available to attend.", "Seems people don't care too awful much about Nobles sneaking off together, but they do care if said Nobles get caught while doing it! Some lessons in subtlety seem to be in order for the Rinaldi's Lady Aria and the Avoirdupois' Baron Edmond.", "I hear miss Drewe made inappropriate commends during an impromptu meeting with the Interim Sheriff, Biggs, speaking on sharing her uniform with Recruit Kegan, despite the idea of uniforms for recruits being unallowed.", "Miss Omen stayed by Deputy Zaria's bedside the whole time she was on temporary stay in the infirmary, ensuring she was happy and cared for despite not having to. What a nice lass that one is.", "Miss Dahlia stayed by Deputy Zaria's bedside the whole time she was on temporary stay in the infirmary, ensuring she was happy and cared for despite not having to. What a nice lass that one is.", "I hear Kafka threw a temper tantrum in the commons over a couple tumblers of whiskey that were drunk. Was there really any need to lift Ilo by the scruff of his neck and threaten to burn off his face? Probably not .. Was there a need to afterward assault a Constable? Definitely not. The man just seems to be insane.", "Surprise, surprise. When it came to a promise Chinco made to Kafka, he refused to keep it and refrained from joining in on the assault of Deputy Zaria at the request of his boss, Clover LePlow. That's some sway the so-called Docktown Boss holds over Chinco.", "That Drewe sure is a lazy one, mocking other Constables for doing their jobs like she should be doing hers. In particular, I was told she made an inappropriate joke about Zaria's skull being broken and how hilarious it was, then proceeded to comment that she wouldn't ever involve herself in a scene or situation if she was off-duty. Doesn't she know Constables don't get time off?", "People are saying Rosaline isn't friendly at all, especially to other females! Word is that she gets angry if mister Niven talks to anybody else, even men like Clover LePlow, when she's around. Must be some sort of sickness expecting the world to revolve around oneself..", "They say Ford is a man worthy of trust. When a certain weasel was stabbed nearly to death, Ford was there guarding him even after he woke up.", "Mister Clover claims to be generous and helpful to everyone, especially newcomers. He's known for handing out coins to those newly arrived in the city. I hear he gave mister Eiryk 12 denarii so that he could manage his expenses until finding a job. Eiryk was offered one later in the day by miss Bekka who said he could work for her until he found another place. When Clover heard that Eiryk had agreed, he gave Eiryk a chiding and demanded the coins he had given earlier back. They say he never even suggested or asked mister Eiryk to join his guild or do anything in return for the coins to begin with. Why would you give coin to help people out until they find a job only to take it back if a job becomes available and they accept it? Is it possible there are strings attached to these monetary gifts?", "People aren't very happy that Clover is trying to intimidate Bekka by saying he's going to blacklist her guild in Docktown when they claim that all she's doing is trying to help people get settled in the city.", "I hear miss Aradhyl got involved in a conversation between two guildleaders, Bekka and Clover, about their business, even implying that Clover might send thugs after Bekka if she didn't listen or agree with what he was saying. That isn't the most courteous behavior for a member of a House.", "I hear mister Thukal got involved in a conversation between two guildleaders, Bekka and Clover, about their business, and implied the other guilds in town would be too scared of Clover's muscle to do anything, which might have just been an invitation for trouble.", "Bekka, in spite of appearances, is said to offer a wonderful service to those new in the city. For people who feel overwhelmed or a bit lost, she offers a sense of belonging as they find their place. For others, she offers a steady income and teachers along with introductions as they seek a permanent guild or House. While she might receive some benefits from doing these things, she never personally asks for anything from her members and cheers them on whether they wish to leave or stay. That seems a good and noble thing to do, aye?", "Sir Matteo is said to be spreading misinformation about the Rinaldi embassy, including that they never pay him. Further, instead of bringing his concerns about members of the embassy to the embassy itself, he insists on speaking to and in front of outsiders, airing his displeasure publicly. This kind of behavior is hardly befitting the manner a Rinaldi Lord should affect.", "Though Eiryk might be the last straw that caused Clover to be upset with Bekka's guild, he's unlike most new arrivals with no history or interest in about why Clover isn't happy. He actually listened and thought about what was said. A lad that listens and thinks? In this town? Craaazy!", "When hearing of mister Sang's lack of providing proper service to University customers, Doctor Hush offered to handle everything for only half the price of the work. Sang lacked doing a statue for someone for over a year while taking similar projects on before completing that order! Hush is doing well looking after such a difficult case.", "Despite the obvious urge to color the commons with mister Sinjaa's blood and bowels, mister Ford did resist and obey the Constabulary as well as advice from a Housemate to walk away and let the argument drop. What a good show for the Rinaldi House and its Guard!", "Deputy Breeze rescued a less experienced guard from having to try and stop a fight between two large tigers. The poor new recruit was trying to be brave, but it was pretty obvious the relief on her face when Breeze showed up and settled the matter peacefully.", "People seem to truly believe that miss Bekka's guild is made for newcomers to the city as a place for them to earn income and settle in before finding a final guild or house with which to end up. The fact that Clover is said to have blacklisted her for that is causing a mass of raised eyebrows and headshakes from those believing he's gone too far this time. What's he afraid of anyway, that Bekka might gain some power in Docktown?", "Despite being an obviously inexperienced guard  in the Constabulary, miss Aster did her best when ordering Ford and Sinjaa to stop their arguing and take it to the training yard. She kept her cool, but the relief on her face when Guardsman Breeze showed up and took over was pretty apparent. Whispers suggest there might be a good future in store for this one.", "Guardsman Breeze is apparently doing a great job in the Constabulary, and isn't afraid to put her own health and life on the line for her duty. She's said to be very experienced and knows the law and how it works inside and out.", "Mister Ford was heard implying that the Bisclavret didn't do their job correctly in regards to mister Kafka. Others seem to think they did themselves wonders as mister Kafka would have undoubtedly brought shame on the embassy due to his misdeeds.", "Miss Noe stepped up and stepped into the leadership position in House Avoirdupois unofficially. With Sir Bayard not having been around or being inattentive, she kept the House together and helped ensure it didn't become stagnate by encouraging the recruitment of new members, paying incomes out of her own pocket, and arranging for teachers for House members.", "Really?! Standing around in the commons clad in only a bra and pair of very short shorts while being kissed on various parts of her body by a servant boy? Certainly she can't be surprised when she brings all sorts of poor attention onto herself. Maybe the poor girl never had a mother to teach her properly ... awww, that's sad.", "Mister Eiryk volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "Miss Stacy volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "Miss Thaisa volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "Mister Syrith volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "Mister Tark volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "Miss Donatella volunteered to help search the city for injured people and possible survivors right after the initial earthquake.", "I heard Guardsman Breeze was urging people to not go look for injured survivors after the initial earthquake, and to only take care of themselves. That doesn't seem very civic minded, does it?", "That Lieutenant Tonozzi! When the earth started shaking, she took it upon herself to go search for injured survivors in need of help, putting their safety before her own! The Bisclavret should be glad to be represented by someone so responsible and selfless!", "Mister Tark was kind enough to make iron shields for everyone during the earthquakes to protect them from falling debris! I'm sure he lost out on some profits, but it was good of him to put the safety of the city before his own business.", "I hear Clover stepped up and organized a rescue operation after the earthquake. Cheers for someone taking the reigns and leading.", "Apparently Mathias was really curt to his housemate Thaisa without even offering explanation as to why he forbade her to ever go help hunt spiders. He never even bothered to ask why she was going or what had happened! That's certainly not the way to build authority within an embassy.", "I hear that mister Fyros went out and searched for people in Docktown after the earthquake hit. How heroic!", "Mister Tarquin stepped up and aided Clover in doing a search for miss Thaisa and Gentleman Mathias who were reported missing after the earthquake hit.", "Miss Stacy stepped up and aided Clover in doing a search for miss Thaisa and Gentleman Mathias who were reported missing after the earthquake hit.", "Apparently miss Thaisa argued with two gentry who came in to help Gentleman Mathias after he was abandoned indoors while napping just after an earthquake. Valuable time was wasted because of this and teh chances everyone might have gotten hurt or killed increased too! People need to know when to shut their yaps!", "That miss Thaisa, I can't believe her! When a member of her House was injured, she lost her temper and told everyone else to leave, saying she'd look after him. When folk got mad about being ordered around by some unknown, rude commoner, she started talking about how he was 'her Protector' and how she 'couldn't leave him' and was 'just trying to help'. Then she up and left the Cathedral in a huff! So much for not being able to leave, eh?", "Deputy Zaria stuck by Dunwasser Fieldway, keeping peace and assisting with the wounded all night and day amidst the ongoing earthquakes. What a fantastic Constable, and how relieving to know there are some good ones working hard for the city!", "Apparently the Church took to gathering the poor and others of Docktown and escorting them to a camp outside the city where they could take care of them. Paladin Iare even let those in Dunwasser Fieldway know in case they needed to move somewhere safe too. Egads, the Church is doing good deeds. Ximen must be horrified!", "Virendra was heard talking about having sex with Carolyn in the refugee camp. He pretended he was just trying to lift people's spirits, but really he was just tarnishing her name and being very, very inappropriate.", "Choices sometimes come back to haunt you, and taking up with the self-destructive heretic Virendra to head off in the middle of an emergency for sex and games looks to be one of those decisions. His talking about it in public before Knights and commoners is probably what she deserves for being so inappropriate.", "Walking around naked during an earthquake tragedy is one thing, but having sex in Docktown and precarious buildings is quite another. What's she thinking making the love at a time like that? One has to wonder why she's Lady Aria's companion at all.", "I hear Virendra announced in a crowded Dunwasser Fieldway that he and miss Carolyn were heading off to the cathouse, tra-la-la. How improper! And also against the advice of staying in the safe zone during the earthquakes.", "Mister Thukal was said to have shown a complete lack of regard for both the state of the city, and the fact that there were murderers on the loose. He preferred to linger in Docktown over going somewhere safe, and showed a distinct lack of care for the safety of his house nobles.", "Guardswoman Breeze very dutifully risked her own safety to make sure that Docktown was evacuated during the earthquakes, keeping calm and level-headed. She proved to be a good leader during the crisis.", "Mister Jayland instantly obeyed the orders of the Constabulary to evacuate Docktown during the earthquakes, and even brought lumber to the camp in the field for use in creating shelter and protection.", "The new recruit to the Constabulary has acted professionally in every situation. He went so far as to travel down into Docktown at its most dangerous to assess the safety of the Bay and help evacuate people during the earthquakes. It's not too long before a man like that will be promoted!", "Mister Eiryk reportedly sent a scroll to Guardswoman Breeze sharing the latest news about evacuating the city due to the earthquakes and disclosing any scouting that had been done. It was good of him to make sure she was kept up to date on developments when she wasn't able to see and hear them for herself.", "Without thought for himself, Suavis is constantly serving in his capacity as a healer. He found vials and collected blood from donors for people during the earthquake without complaint or hesitation. He's said to always be ready and available to help those in need.", "Always willing to serve, Suavis entered Docktown, despite danger to himself, to retrieve vials for the collection of blood in payment to the sylphs. Despite it not being enough to withhold their elemental wrath, he sure did his part to attempt to save the city!", "Miss Senora generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Miss Stacy generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Zev generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Kegan generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Miss Zaria generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Thukal generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Jayland generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Eiryk generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Miss Adora generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Ford generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Ilo generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Cullan generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Kheldon generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Miss Polgara generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Fyros generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Tark generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Oushi generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Miss Dahlia generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Mister Dylan generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Paladin Iare generously donated blood to help meet the sylph's requirements for prevening a tidal wave from striking the city.", "Rumor has it that Ilo ran to fetch the sword that was to be offered up to the air elementals, making quite an effort to be helpful during the event.", "Deputy Zaria was one of the only Constables willing to do her duty, staying behind to help people evacuate the city, even after knowing that a tidal wave was imminent.", "Word has it that miss Chen actually sacrificed herself to save Guardswoman Breeze during the tidal wave. What a trooper, and how surprising!", "Even after most others had left, Deputy Zaria returned to the city to help those still inside escape from the massive tidal wave that struck. Talk about being dutiful!", "Even after most others had left, Guardswoman Breeze returned to the city to help those still inside escape from the massive tidal wave that struck. Talk about being dutiful!", "Did you know that miss Izzy died trying to help save Dazrene from drowning? It's true! She even remained useful in death, serving as a floaty to keep Dazrene above water.", "Father Ramses, fearing for his own life and praying to the great S'allumer, reached for the people who were being pulled back by the water regardless of it compromising his own safety. If that's not a representative of the Light then don't know what is!", "Begrudingly someone told me that Guardswoman Breeze tried to save them from the tsunami. Something was mumbled about it being ridiculous how unselfish people are, but gratitude was shown nonetheless. Yay for heroes!", "Despite being severely weakened herself from the flood waters, Deputy Zaria went back for miss Elgin, stating she couldn't leave her behind. Idiotic heroics or a genuine care for preserving life? Who knows!", "Despite physical exhaustion making the task at hand difficult, miss Elgin took charge over Deputy Zaria and determinedly pulled her to safety ensuring she didn't succumb to the flood waters.", "The nerve of that Bekka! I hear she accused those involved in trying to save the city from the sylphs and water elementals heretical! What's heretical about wanting to work things out and possibly prevent a tidal wave? Grr .. grr ..", "Despite claiming that everyone who tried to appease the sylphs were heretical, miss Bekka wrote down a list of to-dos for the next few steps of the journey; how to aid the city, and how to keep everyone safe. Even if she doesn't know what she's talking about, she does try to be helpful.", "I hear miss Achlys risked her own life and health to fetch the corpse of Baron Edmond from within the flooded city walls of Triskellian. How brave!", "The Lady Theressa put on a huge display at the sight of Baron Edmond's corpse, blubbering and carrying on like nothing you've ever seen. While one can understand her grief, her overt behavior wasn't at all appropriate for a woman of her standing.", "Mister Eiryk has been helping to take care of refugees and is going above and beyond his duty as a worker for miss Bekka (though we don't really know what duties he actually has). I heard he even trained and was trying to get more capable people to assist with things more.", "Miss Stacy has been helping to heal people hurt by the tidal wave, learned more about healing, has taken care of refugees, and generally is undertaking more than her job and duty entails. They say she's a really nice minky ..", "Miss Una took it upon herself to find out who was doing what jobs at the farmhouse after the tidal wave and she appointed leaders in various areas in order to make things go more smoothly and effectively.", "I heard Chinco was bickering at the farmhouse with people, being completely unresponsive to anyone but Fyros when it came to helping out with what needed to be done. Why the loyalty to Fyros anyway?", "Diligent and stubborn, mister Kegan refuses to let even weariness hinder what he needs to do. In the absence of his superiors he took up responsibility of ensuring the safety and keeping law and order at the farm, despite being only a recruit in the Constabulary.", "Bekka worked tirelessly to assist the injured and newcomers at the farmhouse camp. She took care to provide food, water, and even a place to worship. Above and beyond that, she thought to make a list on which to write the names of missing and found people. What a wonderful birman!", "Bekka really took charge seeing that everyone was as comfortable as possible after the tidal wave. She made sure people had enough food, water, and even volunteered to act as a courier if needed. She also took initiative making up a list of survivors that showed up at the farmhouse so people could check for their loved ones.", "Word has it that when someone at the farm was grieving due to personal loss, miss Lidia scented herself with an alluring perfume and attempted to be flirtatious with the man despite the fact he was just hoping for a comforting presence. How inappropriate!", "When the city was at its worst, and people were being killed in quakes and floods, the Doloreaux promised to help the sylphs in order to attempt to stop the disasters. Not only did they not fulfill their promises, but they abandoned the task requested of them, and quit the city at Lord Samstag's orders without word of apology or any hint of the aid promised. Talk about poor leadership and great disappointment.", "Miss Bekka did amazing work during the crisis that hit the city, organizing people and making sure the evacuation of the town was as efficient as possible. Good for her!", "People are boggling over the nerve of Doctor Hush who reportedly stormed out of the barracks at the farmhouse and abandoned the Rinaldi Lieutenant Sunta who was dying of a fever right in front of everyone. What happened to that caring and kind healer we've heard so much about?", "Didja hear? Donatella knocked out some of Virendra's teeth for trying to ruin a wedding! Good for her setting him straight and giving him what he deserved for interfering with a happy day of matrimony. It might not have been the most polite way to handle it, but people seem to agree it was what needed to be done.", "I hear Lieutenant Sunta killed the leader of the drays at the farm and kept standing strong despite how badly she was hurt from the event.", "Mister Josef apparently approached Clover LePlow, getting grabby with his stuff, while he was trying to talk with a Noble about the refugees and city status. That's not just poor manners, it's asking to be hurt!", "Mister Clover may be unpolished, but when it comes to knowing his place under Rinaldi authority, he is more than willing to bow to direction. He's glad to lend his man to help check out the city, and agrees to do it under Rinaldi orders.", "Miss Achlys helped with the scouting of Triskellian to see if and when it would be safe to return to the city. Without people like her, it would be a guessing game!", "Despite the fact that mister Tark prefers cremation over burial, it wasn't the appropriate comment to make while transferring coffins into a wagon while the people hadn't had a chance to be revived.", "Miss Sable did a good job during the tidal wave crisis keeping track of people and things, and even arranging for dray meat to be jerked so it would last the refugees longer than it otherwise would.", "Mister Eiryk really knows how to use common sense. When the sylph gave a warning about an elemental creature that the city needed to deal with, he thought on options and how it might negatively effect the town by angering yet another magical being. Foresight in times of crisis is rather proper and welcome.", "Clover brought reports from his scouts to Lady Aria out of respect, deferred to her on the scouting by miss Achlys, brought additional information about the gates provided by one of his men and was actively supporting the city, but she consistently was intent on offering neither thanks nor respect for what had been done. Gratitude goes a long way!", "Where was Lord Twyrch when survivors were stuck and injured and unable to get away from the city, or when bandits started preying on small groups? Who knows, but suddenly he's ready to lead the way into the city when it seems safe to re-enter after the tidal wave. Talk about glory hunting..", "Instead of banding together with the rest of the city to help kill the beast that encroached upon their homes, Clover decided to utilize his time attempting to force the Rinaldi into supporting the return of mister Chinco's arms. Hardly a noble or honorable thing as would be expected of a gentryman; in fact, it's much more similar to the behavior of a Docktown thug.", "With much difficulty, mister Sang willingly lent out his bracelet to assist people with entering town through the waterway so that the gate could be opened within. Without it people might still be stuck out at that camp..", "During the siege of Triskellian to return to the city, Biggs was the only one who sought orders rather than causing mayhem by constantly shooting down anything anyone said.", "Mister Fyros really stayed in the middle of things during the octopus fight, seemingly putting his spear into the beast more than most others.", "Miss Zarie did a good job bandaging up Clover in the middle of the octopus fight. Her efforts should be commended.", "Whatever else you might say about Lady Aria, she isn't a coward. She was willing to put herself right into the thick of things to fight for the city, which isn't what you'd expect from a highborn lady.", "It was nice of Omen to give the head of the big dray that people were fighting to Sunta. Sunta did most of the damage and nearly died because of it, but Omen got in the last shot. She was generous to gift it as a show of respect.", "People seem to be noticing that Chinco's working on changing his ways. Apparently he's even being thoughtful, checking up on wounded House guards like Sunta (shock of shocks) to see if they need anything. If this keeps up he might even smile at a Constable someday. Yeah .. prolly not.", "It came as a surprise when Chinco popped in and asked a wounded Rinaldi guard if the needed anything. Certainly looks like his behavior is changing for the better!", "Guardswoman Breeze lets witnesses know they're meant to testify, but she doesn't let the suspects know that they also need to deliver a testimony. Intentional or not? I don't know, but the people seem to think it's the job of a Constable to make sure everyone knows everything.", "Despite Deputy Zaria requesting an increase in income several times to fit the job she was doing for the Constabulary, Sheriff Biggs ignored all her scrolls and inquiries and didn't even acknowledge that she wished to speak with him!", "Miss Achlys took to the sky and scouted the city, discovering a dangerous beast lurking within! She followed orders without hesitation and, despite her small stature, did a very big job. Nicely done!", "Lieutenant Sunta took on the dray pack leader with skill and bravery, protecting several others present from its vicious attacks. She was terrible wounded during the fighting and dealt great blows to the rampaging creature. Skill, grace, and ferocity -- that's Sunta!", "Miss Omen kept watch at the farm for stampeding drays, and even managed to kill a few during the first hunt of them. She's a lot tougher than she looks, they say, and is reportedly a sweetiepie to boot .. if you know how treat her right.", "Omen gave the trophy of the dray pack leader to Sunta, even though she landed the killing blow herself. She could have tried to selfishly keep it, but being the honorable type, she gave it up without any fuss at all. I say, good show!", "Physician Suavis saved Sunta's life! With mister Fyros as his assistant, he leapt into action rescuing the Lieutenant from the certain death that was surely awaiting her due to the beating she took from the dray pack leader.", "Sang was reportedly standing around in the commons calling the Don foolish, calling Lord Twyrch foolish, and indicating that both of their military knowledge is lesser than his own. What kind of a man calls the Don foolish, honestly?", "Despite a past of taking insult at the slightest comment an attacking others out of boredom, Chinco educated a newcomer of the city on who they could turn to for training in combative arts outside of himself.", "While some details are vague, confessing that she sometimes lets men see her breasts the first time they meet her is at the very least inappropriate.  Lets hope she meant in the bath house.", "Risking life and limb for the sake of a house member shows true dedication and loyalty. Aria went on the bandit expedition to haggle and came home a hero.", "That lioness is smooth and smart.  She stepped in when Aradhyl started publicly slandering another guild that would have hurt the Rinaldi.  Maybe she knows that cookies solve all disputes.", "Xena looked high and low for some friends. It's good to have her in your corner.", "Not even earthquakes can stop the generosity and heroics of Clover. He spent his own resources for the refugees in Dunwasser field and even initiated the search for missing people.", "Even though it was in the best of intentions Anne left the safety of newtown to check on house members. She took a long time and made people worry over her absence because she couldn't be bothered to send word of her safety.", "Used his bronze and his  brains to help with the reinforcements of the sewers after the earthquakes.  He personally helped rebuild a bridge and sent the carpenters to other locations.", "Elgin faced dangerous flood waters to try and save Caitriona.  Maybe Avoirdupois aren't afraid of scary water.", "She put her life on the line when she courageously came back to the flooded town to help people escape the water.", "For being a cat Zaria sure didn't mind jumping right in to try and save Caitriona from the perils of the flood water. Maybe her fur is water proof.", "With  the last of her strength and the help of some others Zaria  tried to rescue Elgin from the rushing flood water. Some call that bravery, others call it stupidity, either way lets hope they all made it out alive.", "Was a real trooper and heroic man when he made sure that his house members made it out of town after the flood waters became dangerous.", "Caitriona tried to save the last group of people leaving from the city when the flood waters were coming! When they hit and Izzy went under for a moment, she reached for her without hesitation! Thats a brave, Bisclavret raised wolfette for you!", "What's with the nurse, always asking people to run letters for her?", "During a tea party hosted by Doctor Hush and mister Fips, Virendra inquired if there was a tea around that could induce arousal. Hardly the most desirable topic of conversation for a polite and public event.", "People are raving about what a great hostess Doctor Hush is. They say she's the perfect picture of social etiquette, ensuring everyone is comfortable, engaged, and providing anybody who attends her events with refreshments.", "Can anyone ever say enough about Doctor Hush? Some people believe that she saved their lives, and note that she's given over expensive healing jars to keep death at bay while conducting surgery. There are your average healers, and then there are devoted healers like her.", "Though Doctor Hush was supposed to give a public speech, Fips stood up and took over, despite nerves, to cater to the waiting people.", "Pompous, arrogant, and rude are three of the words recently used to describe mister Edwardo. I heard that he demanded to be invited along on a dinner date between two courting people, and then insisted the gentleman he and the woman were with had to pay because he was their escort, even though his company was never wanted to begin with. Talk about unbecoming behavior for someone who claims to serve a Noble house.", "Doctor Hush generously co-hosted the Summer Garden Party with mister Fips, and held a talk on the medicinal uses of a variety of herbs. We should all be grateful that she shared her knowledge.", "Miss Rosaline helped mister Fips set up and run the Summer Garden Party, and also lent her prized plum tree for people to see and touch amidst the many other plants on show. How generous of her!", "Want to hear all about mister Fred and miss Natalie's sex life? Apparently you just have to mill about in the west commons and the information will be shared freely by the two, or so witnesses say.", "Miss Valora was kind enough to assist in clearing the rubble from the crack in the wall near the beach at Turret's End. Diligence and hard work are a good way to earn favor from your peers!", "Mister Sang was kind enough to assist in clearing the rubble from the crack in the wall near the beach at Turret's End. Diligence and hard work are a good way to earn favor from your peers!", "Miss Gemma was kind enough to assist in clearing the rubble from the crack in the wall near the beach at Turret's End. Diligence and hard work are a good way to earn favor from your peers!", "Miss Sable was kind enough to assist in clearing the rubble from the crack in the wall near the beach at Turret's End. Diligence and hard work are a good way to earn favor from your peers!", "Mister Virendra was kind enough to assist in clearing the rubble from the crack in the wall near the beach at Turret's End. Diligence and hard work are a good way to earn favor from your peers!", "The Constables are all excited that Deputy Zaria has caught up on the paperwork, sorted through all the old crime records, and has begun closing cases and getting everything in order. What a relief to finally have some organization.", "Even though she was just kidding around, Deputy Zaria asked Virendra to kneel down and be 'her chair'. After he did as she asked, she actually sat on his back! The people around who witnessed it found it be a very embarrassing situation, especially considering she represents the Constabulary.", "I hear Virendra paraded around the commons naked and was clearly heard making inappropriate suggestions to the women present. I know it's Docktown, but some behavior isn't even appropriate for the slums.", "It's said that miss Althea is playful to the point of displaying childish behavior, regardless of whom she's around. Most recently, she was seen acting this way in the presence of Constabulary members and Nobles of her own house in a public area. *tisk tisk*", "I heard that mister Kesari ran away and hid in his room when he was about to be arrested. Talk about cowardly and dishonorable behavior!", "Miss Aluine encouraged mister Seeley to give her a hug upon meeting him for the very first time. While consensual hugs in general are fine amongst friends, that kind of close and familiar behavior between strangers is inappropriate.", "Need a lesson in soldiering? You should look up miss Sable, who is currently training members of the Constabulary in the field. I don't know whether it's free or not, but it's good to know the education is out there.", "When the Constabulary confronted mister Kesari and stated he was to be arrested for his newest crimes, he had the sense to consent and go along without any resistance.

She bravely engaged with the beast and successfully pinned it down before it managed to lash out and harm her in return.", "Esquire Gabrielle performed admirably during the Noble Hunt, her skill with the bow high, and her skill at scouting and picking out prey for the rest of the party to hunt. She kept her cool when faced with the two-headed alligator and aided the rest of the team in engaging it efficiently.", "Sir Alvaro is a true Knight. His bravery when facing the two-headed alligator was commendable, and he didn't hesitate one moment when Esquire Noe was severely hurt by the beast, jumping in between her and the alligator as it turned to attack her, protecting her from further injury and harm. The Avoirdupois are fortunate to have him among their numbers.", "Capitaine Alvaro deserves to be commended for co-arranging a second hunt for the nobles, gentry, and their invited. The event was a success and very enjoyable. He even made sure that everyone was fed during the pause, giving them a chance to recover after fighting the horrible, two-headed alligator.", "Ambassadeur Kaine is an excellent example of chivalry and honor, constantly doing the Bisclavret a great service. His skill with his gun during the Noble Hunt was invaluable throughout, as he dispatched the majority of the animals that were found.", "Baroness Antonia is always the able and accommodating host. Preparations for the hunt are always made that much more easy when both people are able to plan and delegate effectively. Although she isn't much of a soldier, she remained calm in the face of danger, did her best, and knew when she was out of her depth and to stand aside rather than get injured. Instead she used her social skills to play perfectly the host and organizer of the trip to ensure everything ran smoothly.", "Esquire Noe, despite not being particularly martially trained, during the Noble Hunt threw herself into things like a seasoned professional. When faced with the twin alligator, she dove in without hesitation, tackling one of the heads straight on. It's just unfortunate that she was then bucked off and had her poor leg marred.", "Esquire Gabrielle held herself very well during the Noble Hunt, using her bow at distance for great effect against the plumed glidtic. As always, she proved to be most pleasant company to all those that spoke to her during the travels. She's an excellent example of the Avoirdupois gentry.", "Sheriff Zaria really is a good egg. Who else would willingly volunteer to keep minutes at the Guild Council meeting, despite only having a non-voting roll? She's a credit to the Constabulary, and an example for everyone to aspire to.", "Jard's rage reportedly nearly had innocent people attacked after he found out about Gwydion and Scott. It's utterly disheartening that one such as he is part of the militia when he has access to such intent upon those he is meant to protect. He nearly clubbed Deputy Carrot with his warhammer, too! Disgraceful.", "For a Paladin representing the Church, Khagra arrived two hours late to Presbyter Ximen's trial and even spoke out of turn demanding his voice be heard even after the Metropolitans demanded he sit down and be quiet. I'm surprised he wasn't arrested on the spot!", "Miss Nan is a wonderful seamstress and hairstylist. She does her job amazingly well, quickly, and professionally. I'd tell anyone in this city to use her!", "That rapscallion Raz! She didn't come and get arrested peacefully - the poor Constables had to whip her from the tree! Bad form.", "Now, mister Valdus may have committed crimes, but at least he went in peacefully when the Constables tried to arrest him. It's nice when people actually help the city law instead of causing more of a bother.", "What an example of loyalty! Father Quiggly was right by the Inquisitor's side for the whole trial, and spoke for him even when half the city was against him.", "Guardsman Hanneman was kind enough to take the new Paladin Initiate, Chriton, under his wing and teach him. Not only that but he openly offered any and all aid he could to the Initiate as well as the Church. A truly respectable man, Sir Bayard should be proud to have him as his Squire.", "Why does Esquire Meepers constantly mew all of a sudden? It says a lot about the fortitude of one's personality when they pick up the habits of those they are supposed to be above.", "Jard of the Avoirdupois maliciously attacked a poor old coat in the commons, bringing dishonor to his house and to his name. What has gotten into him lately anyway?", "The Guardsman Hanneman stood there as his fellow guardsman, Jard, ruthlessly assaulted a poor old goat in the commons. It reflects badly on his house and his lord, Sir Bayard, as he is his Squire. For shame!", "The Sheriff stood there in the commons as a poor old goat was thrown into a trash can, never lifting a finger to aid him or prevent the assault. She's hardly good material for the Constabulary.", "Miss Aluine rushed to the aid of a poor old goat in the commons, risking life and limb as she neared the fury driven badger, Jardskjalfti. Good on her for being so kind and brave!", "The very sporadically speaking constable, Biggs, sure did handle Jardskjalfti well in the commons. He tried his best to get it in Jard's head that he needed to report things to the Constabulary, and not be assaulting people.", "Miss Rae was dressed like a regular street whore and flaunting her stuff in the Docktown commons. It wouldn't be a big problem, but then she started arguing with Deacon Ximen and Pastor Savryn about whether it was appropriate or not. It's a give-in that harlots aren't smart, but to argue with the church?!", "Did you see Pastor Savryn help Deacon Ximen explain the Light to miss Yvara? She was being thick, frankly, but Savryn kept a cool head on his shoulders thanks to proper holy training.", "Miss Yvara was doomed from the start reportedly. First she tried to defend miss Rae's nearly nude outfit to the church clergy, and then she started to criticize Deacon Ximen in public! She even went so far as to try and cast doubt on the wisdom of the Holy See and their authorities.", "The Light will fall warmly upon Deacon Ximen's shoulders after he set a near harlot straight in the commons. Miss Rae, dressed like a whore, and defending her outfit as appropriate attire, seemed misled and destined for a dark and troubled life. Fortunately, the Deacon's counsel convinced her to accept his charity and dress in more modestly cut wool garments. It's easy to understand why the Deacon has risen so much in the Church hierarchy.", "That Chinco wolf threw a half-eaten apple core into the chapel! When one of the clergy came out to ask who threw it, Chinco was rude and disrespectful, claiming they should thank him for the gift. Further, he refused to give his name to the Church despite several prompts.", "That Chinco wolf threw a half-eaten apple core into the Chapel! When one of the clergy came out to ask who threw it, Chinco was rude and disrespectful claiming they should thank him for the gift. After he refused to give his name to Church members, despite several prompts, Esquire Meepers of House Rinaldi was asked to identify the rabble-rouser, and she refused. It certainly seemed like she knew exactly who did it by the way she and Chinco were smirking betwixt each other.", "A new citizen to town, Fee, is singing the praises of Virendra, saying that they would have been unable to start upon their archery path for a whole month if it wasn't for Vir providing the bow, arrows, quiver, and archer gloves to assist in getting started. How strangely generous!", "One of Sheriff Zaria's own militia harassed and attacked an old man, right in the middle of the commons, and she just stood there, watching and looking bored. After the fact, she goes and throws a cup of water in the poor man's face .. in the dead of winter, no less! It seems like she's less in control of herself than her own subordinates, and what poor behavior for someone in a position of power.", "People are still babbling about Sheriff Zaria doing nothing to aid old mister Samuel while he was being attacked in the commons by mister Jardskjalfti. She merely sat there before proceeding to dump a mug of water on the victim. What a disgrace!", "While one of mister Hanneman's fellow house comrades verbally and physically attacked an old goat, Hanneman idled around and just watched, saying nothing. This seems to be a growing trend in the discipline of the Avoirdupois guard.", "Mister Virendra bravely guarded Pastor Savryn during a recent expedition to Paludestris. The Church is starting to believe he'd make a fine Paladin.", "What's this?! I hear Esquire Dasha was inappropriately whispering to Doctor Hush about sexual antics in front of Fips, the good Doctor's husband, while he was unawares of their private conversation. And when the subject was made audible to the public, propositions such as group sex between the Esquire and three other men were suggested! Not at all appropriate for someone of her rank! What would the Rinaldi think?", "Valdus can't be trusted all, sources say. When was feeling down and alone, Virendra tried taking him aside and encouraging him to try to be a better person, even pointing Valdus in the right direction to start. How does Val pay him back? Why, by trying to cozy up to the woman Virendra is suiting, of course.", "Mister Virendra put the entire group in danger during an investigation in Lord Dubane's manor when he decided to wantonly strangle the butler for some stupid reason. Well, at least Lord Dubane shot only him for it.", "Well, after the way Virendra carried on in Dubane's manor, being as subtle as a brick and strangling the Lord's butler on a whim, he's lucky he only got himself shot in the face and not all the other people who were actually trying to get their jobs done.", "As expected from a Captain of the Avoirdupois (even if they take the shop of a fox), mister Hanneman attended the prayers of Father Ramses on the day of devotionals.", "Who does mister Virendra think he is .. talking about eating .. private parts in the commons? It definitely wasn't innocent! But I suppose that's the nastiness you get in Docktown. Ugh!", "Who does mister Chinco think he is .. talking about eating .. private parts in the commons? It definitely wasn't innocent! But I suppose that's the nastiness you get in Docktown. Ugh!", "Lady Georgianna arrived about the time Esquire Meepers was taking care of miss Carolyn and miss Carolyn was making an order where she was going to use some of the only crushed velvet left in the city. The Lady asked if there would be plenty left for her to place an order, and Carolyn offered to let the Lady order first, but Georgianna told her to go ahead instead. How nice of her, someone of her station .. she didn't owe any favors to Carolyn, but she stepped aside anyway and parted with the rare material.", "Right, so I know healers have to earn money for doing their job and all, but charging one hundred and fifty denarii to save a man's life? Now that's a bit steep. That bat Achlys isn't so nice now, is she?", "Lady Antonia isn't particularly grateful, is she? I hear she had to be reminded to thank the Deacon for saving Dame Xena, but did remember to fuss about what was traded to find her cure.", "The heretic Virendra cannot stop causing problems, and is continuously looking for reasons to fight people. He managed to turn the whole commons against him recently when he accused a master medic and an Avoirdupois captain of misconduct. As if he has a foot to stand on regarding misconduct .. heh.", "Even though it's not his job, Jardskjalfti took a personal interest in the murders Razeer and Samuel were accused of, and, despite not being literate, found someone to translate and came up with several solutions and answers to the conundrum.", "Chinco hasn't changed at all! Deputy Carrot asked him over to the gaol to discuss his crime against the church and he declined saying he would draw his sword against the Constable if he tried. It makes a Constable's job very hard. The Guild Council might want to look into reinstating his ban on carrying weapons!", "Generally speaking, making a deal with a member of the Constabulary where they gut themselves in some form of ritualistic suicide in order to speak without drawing a weapon about numerous convictions and law-breaking is frowned upon. But -- to then also stand there taunting shows very little class. For shame! Even he's better than that .. or so people thought.", "Despite his often questionable choices, Virendra was more than willing to aid the Constabulary in bringing in two very dangerous criminals and seeing justice served. He jumped into the fray and had the presence of mind to disarm Luciano when he was put out of action, and while the Sheriff and a Constable's attention was on Chinco. Well done.", "Mister Chesh instantly and unquestioningly sided with the Constabulary when it looked like they might need an extra hand tackling Chinco and Luciano. Maybe he has turned into a good guy?", "Together with Chesh, Virendra, and Deputy Carrot, the Sheriff stood up to Chinco and Luciano, who refused to answer for their crimes quietly. She lead from the front, and was engaged in combat until both yielded. Once they were defeated and disarmed, she had them both moved to the gaol where they were brought to justice for their crimes. Excellent work, Sheriff, the streets are a lot safer!", "Valiant Valdus jumped in front of a helpless girl during a terrible explosion! He took on all the flames for her -- ahh, what a gentleman.", "It's one thing to defend yourself when being attacked, but to go so far as to just outright kill those attacking you, especially when they don't have any martial experience, is just stooping too low. What happened to letting the law deal with matters? Who does Valdus think he is, being both judge and executioner?", "Father Antos stood up for the values of the church, questioning Deacon Ximen's need to hunt skinks and use their blood, despite the Deacon appearing very snappy, and his known reputation. He also was brave enough to speak up about Virendra being a Paladin Initiate in spite of his H-branded forehead. It takes guts to confront the daily leader of the Church -- especially someone like Ximen.", "Despite being told by the Sheriff not to pick the shadow crawler plant in the arena, Virendra went behind her back and very nearly manipulated Sang into retrieving it for him. When the Sheriff walked in on Sang trying to get the plant for Virendra, with no knowledge on what the plant actually did, Virendra stepped right into Zaria's face and blatantly mocked her by saying she used her title as Sheriff as armor, said he could do anything he wanted, and told her he had no respect for her anyway. Paladin Initiate? Not for long.", "Constable Drosnan doesn't do his job very well. When he brought in a criminal, he allowed the alleged party to remain fully suited in armor for the duration of his stay in the gaol. Smaaaart.", "Hunting skinks in the commons, and smearing the blood all over his face in the name of some church ritual? What has Deacon Ximen fallen to? He's even becoming agitated and upset over not being able to catch a skink. I think Ximen has forgotten his dignity and how to behave properly.", "Did you hear what Zaria did in West Triskellian? It was amazing! She chased down, mounted, and captured a frickin' armored higg'n dray! These things are huuge, easily big enough to bowl over a group of people, and she was all like 'Grrrr .. yous mine now.' Oh yeah, she also returned some items to a crazy old man, and lead troops into battle with mister Hanneman.", "I hear Presbyter Ximen is always looking for information pertaining to the church or heretics. The more useful the information is, the more handsomely he pays. It might not be such a bad idea to sell that one person out, hm?", "Mister Hanneman took over command of the troops from the wildly inexperienced miss Zanthia who was tasked with heading the trip as Reeve of the Rinaldi. His tactics and management made the fight a breeze and ultimately meant that fewer people got injured.", "I'm not quite sure Virendra is right in the head. In what world does a sane person conceive of the idea that setting his hands on fire with whiskey in order to fight a spider is smart?! The spider caught fire, sure, but then the Sheriff and others were put in unnecessary danger. It's not exactly what you need from people that are supposed to be looking out for you.", "Mister Hanneman was invaluable during the siege on West Triskellian and the invading Jadelanders. He helped solve the puzzles at the old tiger's crooked house, scouted out much-needed information, and directed troops efficiently against the magic and numbers of the foreign enemies so that losses were minimal despite the lack of healers. Fantastic!", "Despite having little knowledge on war, miss Zanthia showed courage in representing the Rinaldi on the battlefield, and even pretended to be a Rinaldi prisoner so that the faux 'mercenary' company could enter West Triskellian initially. It didn't work, but her bravery was noted nonetheless.", "During the trip to West Triskellian, and before the army could annihilate the enemy Jadelanders, Virendra's gobby mouth and reckless moves got him killed. Did he really think setting his hands alight to fight a spider was useful? He nearly killed the Sheriff.", "As useful, and possibly funny, as it was at the time, Jasper really shouldn't have disrespected a corpse by throwing it at the oncoming Jadelanders to defend blows. At least he came out unharmed from that particular maneuver.", "He might be a gender-confused hyena, but it's not really something everyone needs to know, particularly before an impending siege upon the Jadelanders invading West Triskellian. At least Logan entertained the wolf Virendra before he died. Keeping his attention away from petty bickering was handy.", "Sir Twyrch was kind enough to lend Lord Valentinus one of his blades, having learned that he was without one until it arrives via courier.", "When the fisherwife wanted to hunt down her husband for spending all the wages he earned on whiskey, mister Jardskjalfti didn't give up the drunkard husband, but paid from his own pockets to ensure the wife and the five kids had enough money to live off.", "Even though the memorial service for Tamara was short notice, Lady Antonia still made a point to show. She had never even met the Baroness, so it was especially touching that she would go out of her way to show her support.", "Rufius met Tomoe and Valdus, asking for their aid in recovering the stolen silverware from the palace. Valdus was quite rude -- he couldn't show basic courtesy and just nuzzled against Tomoe and acted very uncaring. When Tomoe said she would keep an eye out, Valdus directly said he would not and used an excuse of being tired as to why. The man really need to learn proper manners and basic courtesy, and at the very least, be polite and apologize for poor behavior.", "Sir Bayard is rather presumptuous, thinking he knows the reasons why the Rinaldi are supporting Dame Xena overseeing the Sailors Guild. Not only this, which is a mistake all people can make, he threatens to take the law into his own hands if his delusions become true, ignoring the Constabulary, the law, and Rinaldi rule. To conclude the matter, he even questions Dame Xena's honor, a well-loved and well-respected Knight of the Rinaldi. Someone really needs to learn diplomacy if they're going to toss around insults and threats.", "Sir Bayard wrote a rather abrasive letter to Xena threatening the life of Alessa should she cross him, stating clearly that he wouldn't involve the law -- only his blade. He was also presumptuous in Xena's association making unsubtle assumptions that Xena's intentions were dishonorable. He should show more respect for Rinaldi law and Rinaldi Knights.", "Miss Soto aided Silver Butler Rufius greatly when she searched and found no less than ten missing silverware pieces and promptly returned them. Her name is praised amongst the Palace staff as a dedicated and trustworthy person in Docktown.", "Mister Adon aided Silver Butler Rufius more than could be expected when he searched and found six of the missive silverware pieces. He spent days trying to locate the silver, and several times sent in what he had found. His name is praised amongst the Palace staff as a dedicated and trustworthy servant to the Rinaldi.", "As a completely new citizen in Triskellian, mister Castle showed extraordinary loyalty to his new home by aiding Silver Butler Rufius in retrieving the lost silverware. Without much knowledge of the city, he took the time to search and found five of the missing items. As the law abiding person he is, he promptly returned his findings. Mister Castle's name is praised among the palace staff as a dedicated and trustworthy servant to the Rinaldi.", "In spite of his nature, mister Ilo decided to send in the silverware he found -- 8 pieces in all, worth quite a fortune. He is to be commended for going against his nature and following the path of honesty.", " Dame Xena showed exceptional bravery when she spoke up as the first person in the trail against Presbyter Ximen, thereby risking standing alone and unsupported in the accusations against the Inquisition and  risking becoming a target for them herself. A true knight with a brave heart, the Rinaldi can be proud of her.", " All right, all right, never mind that Dame Xena was eating skinks but her table manners when she was doing so! Disgusting!", "Despite personal disagreements and Dame Xena petitioning to get him  demoted within the Church, Deacon Ximen willingly volunteered to go on an  expedition to Paludestris to retrieve some enchanted scissors with which Dame Xena  could be freed from my curse of silence. He could have easily turned her away due to their history, but instead he showed mercy and kindness in a  time when she  most desperately needed it. I'm starting to believe there's much more humanity in him than people give him credit for.", "Good of Dame Xena to have the sense to give up her weapons when she knows her soul is in the clutches of an evil Necromancer.", "After Xena was cleansed of black magic, she was openly angry at Marcus for his desire to keep those tainted with black magic contained so they would not pose a threat to the city or be accused for murders that they may or may not have been involved in. Where's the love???", "Dame Xena aided in Lord Marcus's search for his wife Tamara and recovering her remains, and was a source of comfort for him. She's so loyal.", "Lord Marcus continued the search for his wife, even years after her disappearance so that he, his daughter, and the House could get some.", "Lady Antonia kept the house organized and as safe as possible when Dame Xena and Adon were taken by black magic curse and she had to real way of helping. She delegated takss, kept up on correspondences, consistently visited them in the infirmary to ensure they were being well taken care of, and continued to ensure the day to day business ran smoothly. Despite feeling she had failed in some way, she truly had more success during that trying time than she realizes.", "Sir Twyrch took it upon himself to lead a small group of Rinaldi to the arena and school them in various combat topics free of charge. He was good-natured about the entire ordeal, even lending a weapon to Lord Valentinus with which to spar.", " While sparring with a mixed group of people in the Docktown arena, he continuously made inappropriate remarks to Reeve Zanthia about how she could/should kiss him, how he enjoyed her touch when she was attempting to bandage him, etc. A new Noble to town should be more careful about what he says in public places and who he says it in front of, lest he reflect poorly upon his House and seem less than virtuous.", "After hearing about the black magic curse that afflicted her house members, she automatically took to finding a scholar-mage who could further investigate the true meaning behind what occurred to ensure the safety and reputation of the Rinaldi and their royalty. Truly, her mind is an astounding machine that looks at every angle of a situation and can easily come up with appropriate solutions. She is an undeniable asset to the embassy.", "Lord Matteo asked for a dusky lesson right in the middle of the commons. I know it's not that rare of a language to know anymore, but it's reserved typically for criminal sorts. You don't, as a noble, request that sort of information in the middle of a crowded place.", "Lord Matteo made a scene in the tea house because the Ambassador of the Rinaldi didn't permit him to suit Lady Grazia. He insulted his fellow Knight, Dame Xena, by stating she lacked discretion and that it was partially her fault he couldn't be with Grazia because she supposedly is accepting suitors, and then followingly insulted the Rinaldi Reeve, stating he was a snitch who would repeat any private conversations to his superior -- which he very well should, as it follows protocol. His demeanor is unbecoming his station, and his words are dangerously.", "Dame Xena did show extra-ordinary dedication when Silver Butler Rufius announced the missing silverware. Not only did the Dame spend her own personal time looking for lost items, she also utilized her resources to discover where the missing items were hidden, discovering that a citizen of Triskellian had kept several pieces for himself.", "Mister Fyros put himself in harm's way to lead a group into the sewers to deal with the spider infestation -- nearly losing his life in the process.", "Mister Rylen traveled along with the group heading into the sewers, unarmed no less, to assist in flooding out the mutant spiders into the bay. Brave or stupid .. I don't know, but someone apparently was impressed.", "Did you see that message the Sheriff wrote about the spiders? The one where the Sergeant was asking people not to go down into the sewers? Looks like she rather undermined him there -- I hope that people still get the message.", "Now while it may be all well and good Xena going down to the sewers, it's still a bit reckless of her, isn't it? That place was crawling with spiders and she took civilians. Not to mention possibly blundering through the work that other people had been doing down there.", "Biggs chided Xena for assisting a party of citizens down in the sewers to remove the spiders. He accused her of being the leader and initiator, which she wasn't, and then informed her he was disappointed in her for not writing to him first and letting him know what she was doing. Since when does a Noble have to report their activities to the Constabulary when the matter at hand isn't a legal one? And, furthermore, why is it now an insult to try and make the city a safer place and keep people (who might be too inexperienced for the task they're undertaking) out of harm's way? Someone needs to get their head out of their hiney.", "Dame Xena bravely took control of the sewers and helped arrange for them to be flooded to wash away the dangerous spiders. Just like a knight, to watch out for the common people, the defenseless and the weak.  Its what a Knight -should- be.", "Xena had the balls to not only speak the launguage of the street rats in the commons but also took it upon herself to teach others the bad habit too. Why would a knight show off such a skill?", " Asking for a slumhoodery lesson from another Noble in the middle of the commons. Really? At least Lady Anelie could have done it in private so as not to be somewhat insulting.", "Imagine a perfectly pleasant, lovely field. Flowers growing, bees a'buzzing, tranquil, and idyllic. Now imagine it ruined by that bat girl Achlys brawling all over it! Grrr .. there are arenas for just that sort of thing!", "Imagine a perfectly pleasant, lovely field. Flowers growing, bees a'buzzing, tranquil, and idyllic. Now imagine it ruined by that shrew Alfio brawling all over it! Grrr .. there are arenas for just that sort of thing!", "For a smart fellah, people are sayin' mister Iain is rather dumb. He was said to be standin' right in the commons insultin' every workin' man's way of life, as well as the tactics the Constables use to control criminals. He was heard sayin' we have a lamentable lack of specialization apart from boorish force. I'm not sure what that all means, but it sounds like he's callin' us all stupid. What's stupid is standin' in the middle of Docktown and sayin' so! He's liable to find some boorish force comin' at his nose if he ain't careful!", "As a director it's considered very bad practice to cut actors from a play and then not tell them. That's what Nan did, and left the poor chap to only find out when the show went up. Poor form!", "Even though Braxton is the son of both Lord Twyrch and Baroness Kenina, he has been seen entering the tailor shop filching on the clothing in the racks reserved for the poor and new. You'd think he was well provided for!", "The arrogance of some people! That Sang, especially. I hear he decided it was his right to break up a picnic and ruin several people's afternoons simply because they decided to have a friendly sparring match while enjoying their time in the meadow. He just walked right in like he owned the place, throwing objects and insults, demanding that everyone stop and concede to his always delusional whims. Just because he's some University so-and-so doesn't mean he's better than anyone else. Someone should tell him that! Oh wait .. I'm telling him that.", "It seems Lord Twyrch has done a wonderful job raising his son, Braxton, and that the boy is eager to follow in his father's diplomatic footsteps. Prelate Theressa called upon young Braxton to discuss concerns over the behavior of some of the Bisclavret craftsmen. She was very pleased with his handling of the situation, calling him prompt, efficient, diplomatic, and graceful.", "That boar Knight Sir Erwin doesn't know much about gratitude. A fellow boar tried to get him to go along to help out a failing village and he simply turned it down.", "Miss Aneira did a wonderful job in hosting the dinner party, and she made the Bisclavret house very proud.", "Whilst in the commons, mister Cullan was overheard forcing his opinion on a reluctant mister Giles on what is and isn't appropriate in terms of service to the Constabulary. He was speaking as a member of the militia, whose sole purpose is to take up arms against criminals, but that's not entirely what the Constabulary is about. As Giles was sticking up for himself, Cullan also decided to chide miss Odessa on waving about a naked blade despite that he was hypocritically carrying an exposed rapier himself. Get your facts straight, wolfie!", "I heard that Cullan was repeatedly insulting during a conversation he was having with mister Giles about the Constabulary, and when he was informed of this and requested to apologize, he proceeded instead to repeat the insult twice more, and threaten him! Either he's too stupid to follow a simple conversation, too arrogant to admit his mistakes, or he's an abusive brute.", "Lady Georgianna ran a small social and did so with grace, despite that someone faceplanted into a pie.", "Lady Georgianna wasted no time arranging a social upon her return to town. The turn out was great and the company enjoyable for such little planning.", "Mister Chinco kindly offered fresh, hand-picked strawberries to everyone in the commons. What a breath of fresh air!", "Fyros was rumored to be busily running in and out of the commons, rudely throwing scrolls at the poor, overworked courier, all while blatantly ignoring everyone else present even though he was greeted several times. Apparently busy mercenaries have no time to return pleasantries, and likely they're trained in poor manners. What a horrible trade skill.", "That bat, Achlys, sure can keep a cool head. She even managed to patch up Deacon Ximen -while- he was burning a heretic! Talk about skill .. woh.", "Don't make any arrangements with Doctor Hush. She takes loyal friends and discards them when they are no longer useful to her. She'll make vows and arrangements for instruction and payments, for willing service, and totally pretend they never happened and threaten to blacklist them for inquiring about the status of said arrangements. Next, she might send them a scroll, saying she doesn't even want any correspondence to discuss the situation like civilized people would, but will instead make threats via the courier that one simple query is cause for a blacklisting. Can a person become more hostile or arrogant and totally dismiss all discussion and arrangements previously agreed upon?", "That arrogant young Braxton started a scene with a loyal Bisclavret guardsman about nothing. Seems mister Viktor and young Pepper have known each other for years, and are basically siblings, but that didn't stop Braxton from berating him and insulting his honor, accusing him of gross misconduct and bringing shame to the House. He drummed Viktor right out of a job, right then and there! Little Pepper was only sitting on his shoulders, like she always does! I don't know if being the son of a Noble gives that entitled twerp authority over all of House Bisclavret, but he sure seems to think it does.", "People might not generally care, but Hush was in public, in the west commons, referring to people as twats in the crowd. Even though it's amusing, it's not very appropriate for a gentry member, is it?", "Did you hear that? Apparently Fyros lied straight to Achlys' face saying Hush said he was allowed to learn medic from her despite being outside the University guild. When Lys checked up with her boss this was in fact not true at all. Then he cussed Hush in the middle of the commons for calling him out! What a twat!", "Mister Fyros openly spoke out against Doctor Hush, a woman of rank that is held in high regard by most, if not all, of the city, and in the commons! He called her all sorts of horrid names and it was really mean and hateful. For shame, mister Fulke, for shame!", "Miss Nan took the time to not only write and direct a wonderful play for the city, but she included a valuable lesson in the script itself -- that every action has a consequence. In this case, we learned the valuable lesson that taking grains impairs one's judgement - sometimes fatally.", "Miss Nan wrote and organized a play which turned out to be a big success. You have to admire the dedication and hard work such an endeavor requires.", "When telling newcomers about his guild, mister Chesh freely advertises that he doesn't care whether the jobs he gets hired to do are legal or not, he's just happy to do them. For an indentured servant, he isn't very smart, is he?", "Lady Georgianna held a social get-together which everyone was invited to. There were fresh strawberries, drinks, chocolate, pie, and good company. She went out of her way to arrange for something to happen during a time when hardly anything has been happening at all.
