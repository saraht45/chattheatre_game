          <Base:Description type="examine">
             Unlike the stone common throughout the city, this room is walled and floored with black marble veined with white. The ceiling stretches up into the darkness above, leaving you unsure as to exactly how tall the room may be. Glowing light from the walls appears to be from many niches carved into the stone. Around the room you see no other way out save the door you just came from.

             You are standing in the middle of a gigantic, almost barren room. Glancing around you see what looks like a checkerboard pattern on the walls of the room. The ceiling of the room goes further then the eye can see into the black darkness above.

The arch-braces rise from some of the larger posts, and curve slightly 'inward' as they rise to support the ceiling beams.
