             painting of a seductive woman
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             This painting is done in muted tones that convey a sense of warmth and comfort. A low bed dominates most of the canvas, set in a room of dim lighting, carpets and cushions, and hanging transluscent veils which give a secure, contained feel without being claustrophobic. The bed, covered in a red, purple and gold quilt, is strewn with cushions and a young gazelle woman lies naked among them. Waist-length blue black hair is spread in a silky mess on the cushions around her head. A dainty pink tounge is just visible between her sensual lips, and her heart shaped mouth is curved in a coy smile. Large blue-grey eyes seem to gaze out of the painting right at the viewer, silently inviting them to join her on the bed. One of her arms is thrown casually above her head, resting careless across cushions and hair, fingers playing sensuously along the length of her long smooth antlers. The viewer's eye is drawn down the line of her arm to her breasts and then lower down her petite yet shapely body. Her other hand is draped lightly over her flat belly, her short manicured nails sliding easily into her fawn fur. Dainty cloven hooves are propped up slightly on the cushions, drawing her knees up and her thighs are slightly parted, but angled just away from the viewer, a slight concession to modesty with a hint of flirtatious teasing that is only emphasised by her smile. A simple 'R' embroidered on one corner of the quilt serves as the signature of the artist.
