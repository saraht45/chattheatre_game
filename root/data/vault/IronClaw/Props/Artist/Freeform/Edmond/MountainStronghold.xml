             an oil painting of a mountain stronghold
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             The entire scene is one of dour and dreary grays, whites and purples.  The foreground of the painting is dominated by a massive mountain, appearing quite precipitous and jagged, capped by a copious amount of snow.  Approximately halfway down from the peak, tucked very tightly into the deep purple shadow of the mountain is a fortress.  Balanced precariously upon a cliff, seeming about to tumble from its perch, it seems to cling to the greater natural structure upon which it is built.  Calling the structures a stronghold is rather generous.  Its dark gray curtain walls are blanketed in pure white snow, so that the parapets are nearly invisible.  Peeking out from behind the walls is a lone keep, its height insignificant when compared to the sharp peeks surrounding it.  A single window is visible, a faint orange light radiating from it, showing that the occupants are wise enough to ward of the chill of winter.  Far below can be seen a pass cutting its way through the mountain range.  A narrow route, only discernible from its surroundings due to a few small dots of black.  Upon closer inspection, these dots can be made out as a tiny caravan, three wagons each pulled by a pair of drays, and a handful of figures trudging through the snow at their sides.  Slashes of white paint erratically cross the landscape, creating the effect of windblown snow driven by howling winds.  The royal purple mountains continue into the distance, seeming to mingle with the overcast, stormy gray sky, so that a horizon is nearly impossible to locate.<br/><br/>It is signed with a stylized E.

         "Sketched herein is a shaded male timber wolf, statuesquely sitting before a winding stream that escapes with ease from both sides of the canvas. His fur has been intricately detailed to lend a shaggy, yet well-kempt appearance, whilst his hair falls in a swirling pool of waves about the middle of his shoulders.  His eyes are sharply drawn and focused intently upon the body of water before him, peering downward in an almost imploring fashion.  His thin lips are faintly pursed, but his mouth is captured in a firm pose, deliberately portraying an air of concentration. His strong left hand is curled around an unseen object, while his right is reaching forward toward the reflection in the stream. Gazing upward from the untouched water is a female face. Her features are quite vague and light, blending with the water which binds her. Long locks of tresses can be spotted here and there, and if one looks just right, a coy smile filters through the lines toward the male wolf. Her dainty right hand is outstretched, and a few ripples appear as a sign of impact upon the surface. The rest of the canvas has been smudged carefully with shadowed clouds. In the upper-right hand corner, a dull sun has been created bearing the name 'Caliste' in small letters."
