             oil painting of a battling percheron
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             In oil paints on a tall, rectangular canvas is the figure of a large, muscular percheron clad head to toe in Avoirdupois military regalia. He is depicted standing ankle deep amongst his fallen foes with one last remaining - a zombie with it's flesh sloughing off - waiting to be sliced in two by the readily blood-stained longsword. This is held horizontally in front of the horse, while beads of sanguine blood scatter outward from the dark steel blade by the force of toil-wrought muscles bulging beneath storm black brigandine and silvery-grey swordsman pants. The zombie, however, doesn't appear to be the least bit afraid, though that might be explained by the visibly cracked skull revealing a lack of any brains whatsoever. It is colored in shades of grey, dark green and red by the use of splotching to create the impression of rotting flesh, gaping in areas with blood red paint. The carnage at the soldier's hooves seem to be a motley of pterodactyls, giant toads, skeletons and people alike, all in the throes of dying or death. Their broken forms are sprawled and cracked, and their faces - if they still bare them - are contorted in excruciating pain as their life blood leaks onto the muddied grass below. The percheron himself single-mindedly focuses on the task at hand, slaughtering the undead that stands in his way. This is represented by the hardened expression upon the horse's face, enhanced by the slight furrow of his craggy brow and set of his jaw. Upon his face there are several large scars, a wide one mangling his right cheek and another sliced directly across his left eye, which is implied by the studded gold eye-patch embroidered with the rearing destrier. His hair is close-cropped and smeared with slime - as is the rest of him - from the battle he has fought, but there is enough grey-white to suggest at his natural hair color. The majority is shaved away, leaving him with an imitation cap atop his head, while his equine coat is a sleek blue roan, the only part of him that doesn't take to the massacre. A sheen of sweat glistens there, but he maintains a strong demeanor throughout the struggle he faces head-on, standing tall amidst the battle. In blood leaking towards the bottom, right-hand corner is the name 'Una', the U dotted with eyes in imitation of a smiley face.
