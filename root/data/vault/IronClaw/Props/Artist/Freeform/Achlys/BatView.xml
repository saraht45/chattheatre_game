             bats-eye color drawing of a beach
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             A great swathe of orange dots vertically mark the centre of the scroll, darker in areas and lighter in others to represent shade. Here and there you see thickly-pressed yellow, orange, and green stars, oblongs and obtuse triangles within the dots; they may or may not be seashells. The artist has attempted to shade them in with a blue pencil, but the contrast only gives them a blue line along one edge. By the left-hand side of the orange stretch of 'sand' you see green-blue blobs and swirls in various clumps supposedly meant to be bushes. A brown strip of lines and scribbles extends to the left of the parchment, while on the right of the sand you see deep blue wiggles and speckles of pencil. A simple grey fish lies flat on the surface of the ocean to finish off the piece. All in all, you view an extremely amateurish portrait of a beach's bat's eye view.

         "Sketched herein is a shaded male timber wolf, statuesquely sitting before a winding stream that escapes with ease from both sides of the canvas. His fur has been intricately detailed to lend a shaggy, yet well-kempt appearance, whilst his hair falls in a swirling pool of waves about the middle of his shoulders.  His eyes are sharply drawn and focused intently upon the body of water before him, peering downward in an almost imploring fashion.  His thin lips are faintly pursed, but his mouth is captured in a firm pose, deliberately portraying an air of concentration. His strong left hand is curled around an unseen object, while his right is reaching forward toward the reflection in the stream. Gazing upward from the untouched water is a female face. Her features are quite vague and light, blending with the water which binds her. Long locks of tresses can be spotted here and there, and if one looks just right, a coy smile filters through the lines toward the male wolf. Her dainty right hand is outstretched, and a few ripples appear as a sign of impact upon the surface. The rest of the canvas has been smudged carefully with shadowed clouds. In the upper-right hand corner, a dull sun has been created bearing the name 'Caliste' in small letters."
