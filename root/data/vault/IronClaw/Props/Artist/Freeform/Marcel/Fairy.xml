             pencil drawing of a fairy
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             Upon closer inspection, the skirt of the gown is in fact a series of flower petals cupping the fairy's and spilling down over her legs, only revealing the very tips of her toes. Her breasts are covered by a pair of smaller of petals that show only the smallest hint of clevage and leave her back completely uncovered. A pair of almost see-through wings sprout from her shoulderblades, keeping the slender creature aloft. Her face is mostly indistinct and devoid of features other than a faint curve of a nose and a pair of long, tapered ears jutting out from underneath her short, wavy hair. The entire painting is somewhat blurred and smudged, hinting that either the fairy is supposed to be in motion or the artist do not have the steadiest of hands.<br/><br/>It is signed by Marcel.

             A monochromatic pencil drawing of an elegant flower fairy. An extremely slender, frail woman clad in what appears to be an evening gown, she floats across a blurry and indistinct background.

         "Sketched herein is a shaded male timber wolf, statuesquely sitting before a winding stream that escapes with ease from both sides of the canvas. His fur has been intricately detailed to lend a shaggy, yet well-kempt appearance, whilst his hair falls in a swirling pool of waves about the middle of his shoulders.  His eyes are sharply drawn and focused intently upon the body of water before him, peering downward in an almost imploring fashion.  His thin lips are faintly pursed, but his mouth is captured in a firm pose, deliberately portraying an air of concentration. His strong left hand is curled around an unseen object, while his right is reaching forward toward the reflection in the stream. Gazing upward from the untouched water is a female face. Her features are quite vague and light, blending with the water which binds her. Long locks of tresses can be spotted here and there, and if one looks just right, a coy smile filters through the lines toward the male wolf. Her dainty right hand is outstretched, and a few ripples appear as a sign of impact upon the surface. The rest of the canvas has been smudged carefully with shadowed clouds. In the upper-right hand corner, a dull sun has been created bearing the name 'Caliste' in small letters."
