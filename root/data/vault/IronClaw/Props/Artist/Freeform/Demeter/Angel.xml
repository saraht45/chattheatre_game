             oil pastel portrait of an angel
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             Through the use of oil pastels, giving the surface of the canvas a waxy texture, a portrait of the glowing silhouette of an angel has been depicted. Bold strokes of lighter, yellow pastels help to highlight the inner glow surrounding the figure, while paler pastels, such as lilac and rose, soften the gown and the angel's features. With wings spread  wide, an ethereal breeze flutters the golden-tinged feather tips, alongside the cascading blond hair and a pale lilac-hued gown, the wind is such that they drift outward from the frame. A pair of slender hands are clasped over the heart, while the angel's blue-eyed gaze, brightened barely with a white pastel, is cast into the horizon.

         "Sketched herein is a shaded male timber wolf, statuesquely sitting before a winding stream that escapes with ease from both sides of the canvas. His fur has been intricately detailed to lend a shaggy, yet well-kempt appearance, whilst his hair falls in a swirling pool of waves about the middle of his shoulders.  His eyes are sharply drawn and focused intently upon the body of water before him, peering downward in an almost imploring fashion.  His thin lips are faintly pursed, but his mouth is captured in a firm pose, deliberately portraying an air of concentration. His strong left hand is curled around an unseen object, while his right is reaching forward toward the reflection in the stream. Gazing upward from the untouched water is a female face. Her features are quite vague and light, blending with the water which binds her. Long locks of tresses can be spotted here and there, and if one looks just right, a coy smile filters through the lines toward the male wolf. Her dainty right hand is outstretched, and a few ripples appear as a sign of impact upon the surface. The rest of the canvas has been smudged carefully with shadowed clouds. In the upper-right hand corner, a dull sun has been created bearing the name 'Caliste' in small letters."
