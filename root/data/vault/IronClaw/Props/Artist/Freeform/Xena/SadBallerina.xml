             an oil painting of a ballerina
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             This entire canvas is painted a pearly white, save for the middle portion which has been smeared with light grey paint into a squarish shape to represent a seat. Resting upon it is a young female jackrabbit with cream-colored fur. She is clad in a snow white tutu, snow white stockings, an ebony short-sleeved blouse, and white dancing slippers. Her slender arms are crossed before her and are pressed against her knees, with her left hand faintly gripping her right elbow. Her head is downturned so that her face is entirely concealed from the viewer. Straight locks of flower-laden reddish-blonde hair drape forward over her left wrist with a few stray petals delicately dabbed in mid-air, suspended while falling.

         "oil painting of two sleeping lovers"

      <Core:Property property="trait:examine">
         "A beige half-circle borders the upper left of this canvas, receding into a full coral-colored sphere upon which rests a butterfly. It has been intricately shaded; the bubble pattern on it's outspread wings filled in with careful dabbings of crimson, dark blue, and rich purple. The elongated body has been divided into three sections via black brush strokes: the top featuring a barely discernable head of blue adorned with curved, symmetrical antennae, the middle simply melting amongst the wings, and the bottom detailing a faintly pointed end with striated black accents. Just below and diagonal to this, a dragonfly gently holds the outer rim of the beige half-circle, framing it with it's broad, V-shaped, and highly-patterned wings. Stylized rippled, multi-colored shapes decorate the expanse of these appendages, some occasionally left with a swept, swirled look, others almost silkily brushed onto the canvas. The lower end of the dragonfly seemingly hovers over a cerulean wide-petaled flower which entirely covers the forehead and hair of the male figure captured underneath its fragile body. Dark eyebrows rest in a natural arch upon the shaded upper portion of his face while almond-shaped eyelids and thickly-brushed sable eyelashes peacefully conceal his gaze from the world herein. An almost bronze tint colors his narrow cheeks, dimpled chin and short neck, while an earthy neutral tone brings life to his subtly curved and closed lips. None of his clothing can be made out save for a small portion of blue collar that rests against the slender left arm of his white-gowned lover. Hers is a face clad in cream, and framed in long undulating brown tresses strung with aquamarine beads which fall freely across her back and simple white gown into the right edge of the painting. Only part of her face can be viewed; her left eye not unlike that of the males, though hers has been kissed with a hint of bronze coloration to match his hue. Her lips are small and smoothly glazed in rose red paint. Her delicate frame is gently pressed against that of her lovers, her left cheek intimately resting against his right; her left arm curled about his flower-crowned head softly. Similarly, his strong right hand is looped laxly around her back in a protective fashion; his fingers mellowly laced through her hair. The rest of this painting is a colorful rush of flowers which surround the contently sleeping couple in vibrancy and life. All manners of blue, pink, purple, green, and red tones have been utilized abstractly, making it nearly impossible to make out the variations of plants within, none having a beginning or end;  all of them winding, growing, craning, toward the center of the painting to envelop the subjects in folds of natural beauty."
