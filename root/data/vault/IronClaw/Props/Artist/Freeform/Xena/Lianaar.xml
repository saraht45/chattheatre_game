             a painted portrait of a female raccoon
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             This entire portrait is bordered in rough, rich brown paint strokes; the lines jagged and grained throughout in a stylized, wooded pattern. Situated precisely in the center is a primitively-painted beige stool; two of it's small, supportive legs just barely peeking out from underneath it's occupied seat. Perched poisedly atop this generic piece of furniture is an elfin raccoon with silkily-swirled rust-colored fur, and golden-streaked copper hair; these tresses are captured just below the crown of the head in a bronze hairclip bejeweled with a single vibrant sapphire, before they cascade downward from her attentive ears in natural waves to rest just against the body of her shoulders. Deeply-shaded vibrant emerald eyes curve elegantly against the frame of her face, curling just-so at the ends to present the shape of symmetrical almonds. Her eyebrows have been created through a myriad of small, detailed strokes which arch upward, lending a certain amount of seriousness to her otherwise softened and refined features. Her thin hands are gently curled around an unremarkable cup; the right simplistically decorated with a gold ring bearing a faintly perceptible half crescent, the left sporting a silver ring decorated with an anchor. A pair of dangling aquamarine teardrop earrings elegantly hang, coordinating colorfully with her similarly shaded gown and shoes.<br/><br/> A flamboyant X has been swiftly executed in the lower right-hand corner of the painting, in signature of the artist.
