             a painting of Sir Matteo di Rinaldi
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             Sir Matteo di Rinaldi is a tall lithe fox, with long, smooth silver fur, and black hair, worn pulled back with an accent braid. Golden-flecked brown eyes are set above a fine nose and a thin mouth, complete with curved lips. Short manicured claws, on expressive hands, and smooth feet are also visible. You also note his fine eyebrows, attentive ears and long smooth tail.  He is wearing spurs, an alabaster suede belt pouch, a silver ring, a pair of ebony suede gloves, a pair of dusky grey damask pants, a sheathed steel sabre, a dusky grey damask slashed sleeved doublet, an alabaster silk ascot, an alabaster silk shirt and a pair of ebony suede knee-high boots. He is sitting below a peach tree, with his feet crossed and a sheathed steel sabre is settled on his lap, his right hand lay on it. The sky above him is in the motion of becoming dark, yet his eyes seems to glow, contrasting to the shadows around him. His fur flows with the leaves of the tree, noting a small wind picked up during his relaxing state. His face is calm and peaceful, as he stares back at you. The peaches on the tree seem so livid, you can almost smell them. The scene seems rather dim, other than the aura he emits.<br/><br/>This painting is signed by Melody.
