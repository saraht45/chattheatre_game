             a vibrant painting of a woman in Calabria Park
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             Majestic maple and oak trees fill your vision, under a clear, sunny blue sky; the light of the blazing sun filters down through the leaves serenely, the foliage permitting the light through but softening it, leaving streams of light amid the pools of darkness over the lush, green grass.  Resting against the most ancient looking maple tree, you see a sleek panther, her short, smooth white fur gleaming subtly under the indirect rays of light.  She leans haphazardly against the tree, her body in a complete state of rest; you can see the muscles of her legs, hiding under her jade cotton ruffled skirt, holding no tension, her long, naughty tail is coiled loosely in her lap, hips perfectly aligned with the ground; you half imagine her breath barely stirring her white linen blouse and her jade bodice, her breasts rising shallowly at the cloth, not out of pain or wariness, but out of total acceptance of herself, total peace.  Her bare, unburdened neck leads your eyes gracefully to her face, her long smooth blue black hair spilling lazily over her shoulders.  Her face remains placidly indifferent, showing neither pain, nor fear, nor guilt, the muscles slack with peace, her full mouth parted ever-so-slightly, her thick lips smooth.  Her expressive ears frame her face, the smallest sliver of piercing, steel gray showing from under her eyelids.<br/><br/>
In the lower right corner you see a large G in red, as the only signature.
