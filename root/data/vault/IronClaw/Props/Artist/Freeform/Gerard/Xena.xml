             a watercolor painting of a woman deep in the forest
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             A lush, green canopy of a forest assaults your eyes as you first glance at the painting, the colors so vibrant they almost seem surreal, exaggerated; the sun shines violently above the trees, but the leaves cast deep shadows, muting and dulling the color of everything below it.  One tree stands more prominently than the others, in the center of the painting, and you notice a lioness wrapped around it; daisies are woven through her short, lustrous bisque fur almost as if they have grown over her throughout ages of time, slowly claiming her body.  Her right thigh curls around the base of the tree, accentuating her toned legs with an ease about them.  Her curvaceous body rests wearily against the trunk, her arms loosely holding herself pressed against it, graceful hands gripping it wanly, her breasts entirely concealed against the bark save for the suppleness of her body.  Her chin is tucked, allowing her cheek to rest tiredly against the bark.  Her sensual, soft pink lips are parted barely, the muscles in her face slack, exhausted.  Her gimlet, cardinal eyes two bright points in the darkness, gazing wistfully, needfully at the viewer no matter what angle she's viewed from.  Her long flowing fiery-red hair billows down her body, a sharp point of defiance against the dim forest light, untouched by the daisies.br/\><br/>
In the lower right corner you see a large G in red, as the only signature.
