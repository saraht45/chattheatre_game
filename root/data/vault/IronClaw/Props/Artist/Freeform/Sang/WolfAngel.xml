             oil painting of a sword bearing angel
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             A wolf-angel shrouded in a misty green toga, with greens as dark as a woodland forest and as light as the purest jade mixing and stirring, intoning her ethereal nature. She is tall and full-figured, a gleaming copper short sword in her strong right hand lifted toward the heavens in victory, the sunlight richly glints on it's tip. Her other hand crossing her waist finds its rest on her right hip encompassing it with feminine care. Her sleek ginger fur complements the bright shine of the sword by showing her warriors musculature, and the delicate swell of her breasts. Her sharp silver eyes reflect the sun that gleams from the sword, her features set in firm tranquillity, both hard as granite, yet warm and caring. Her white hair is cut soldier short, and is yet fluffy and wayward. Behind the angel clouds roil in a wide array of bold colours, ranging from a rosy red to a dark and mysterious violet, within which clouds more angels can be spied, ducking amongst wisps and lazing in the mist. Near the peak of the cloud one wisp is pulled away from all of the others forming a serpentine 'S' shape.
The painting came from an artist with unsurpassed skills.

          <Base:Description type="look">
             An oil painting of roiling clouds. Despite the fury of the clouds, an angel dressed in green clothes floats through, seemingly unaffected by the winds. The tranquil expression of the angel displays a sense of peace and contentment.
