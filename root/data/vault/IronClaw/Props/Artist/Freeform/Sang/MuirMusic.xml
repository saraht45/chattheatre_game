             sheet of music
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             A double-wide sheet of paper with music staffs throughout used to write music notation upon or to read a musical compostition.
All the writing on this piece is done in a delicate and flourishing calligraphy. It is entitled, "The Muir", beneath this spidery notes fill the the many bars. If you have a knowledge of such things you will be able to identify a sweeping, nostalgic melody for a lute, that should, if played properly, have the sounds of trees swaying in the wind, and babbling brooks set to tune. At some points a delicate counter-point comes into play, adding some deeper complexity to the piece and it concludes with an uplifting flourish. Surrounding the notes there are various depictions of forest life, with vines entwining between the bars, near the bottom left hand corner of the piece the vines curl to form a serpentine 'S' shape.
This is an unsurpassed work both in appeal and tune, if played correctly.
