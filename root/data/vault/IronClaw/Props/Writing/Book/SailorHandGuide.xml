             Respect for the Sea
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             <br/>First of all be respect for the sea herself. The most important thing to remember be that no matter what, when ye be at sea, ye be at her mercy. And anything ye can do to make her happy be a good idea. Just don't start thinking that these rituals be too much of a pain, else ye'll soon be facing her fury. <br/><br/>First of all, know that the sea be a Lady. It only be the fairer gender that can make ye both hate them and love them all at once, or hate them because ye can nae help but love them. It only be women that can rise from placid to tempestuous in time shorter than it takes ye to draw breath. She be beautiful, harsh, and savage, and she'll steal a mans heart as soon as his life. She be every sailor's mistress, always tempting them back to her with nary a care to what he might be leaving behind. <br/><br/>And she be a jealous mistress. She does nae mind what ye do on land, but when ye be sailing her waters  do nae let her catch ye with another broad. The only exceptions to this be lasses with red hair, as they be her daughters. <br/><br/>This be the justification of having your figurehead be painted with red hair, as it will encourage her to favour your ship, though only if ye first give it a libation of some kind. Some seamen will use their blood as libation to stain their figurehead's hair, and renew the libation when the stain goes brown, to ensure that their devotion to their mistress be not forgotten.  So long as your figurehead be attached to your ship, the sea will nae drag ye down, as to do so would be to kill her own daughter. This fact often be confused with that of why having a figurehead with bare breasts, which be more to do with storms, and will be discussed later in this book. <br/><br/>If the sea favours your ship, she may send ye omens of what be to come. Storm Petrels, the birds that seem to walk on water, be a warning that storms be approaching, and be widely regarded as souls of the shipmates ye've lost while on the waves. If anyone on your crew should happen to kill one of her messengers for whate'er reason, then she'll turn from ye, causing ill luck till the one who committed the crime should pay with his life. The same be true for the albatross, though it can be said to have a power all of its own, rather than simply warning ye of what be in store. <br/><br/>On the other hand, she does nae favour ravens in the least, and cutting the throat of a raven is a sure way to gain favour from her for a short while. A wise sailor it be who keeps a raven in his hold for any such occasion when luck is sorely needed, though catching the blasted things often be more trouble than it be worth. Ravens can also be used as a way of apologising to her, simply cut the birds throat, pluck it's longest feathers and tie a weight to them, sending them to the ocean floor as proof of your deed. Do nae cast over the bird itself, as it will attract sharks, and it be good eating besides. <br/><br/>Once the sea has claimed a man for herself, then it not be wise to attempt to rescue him. He who falls behind stays behind, and those that attempt to circumvent the sea's wishes will be harassed by her until she has taken what she desires. This be why many sailors do nae know how to swim, it be a way to show the sea that ye trust her nae to take ye before your time.

             Partnership with the Sea
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             <br/>The second most important thing for ye to understand be ye Ship. Ye be in partnership with her, and if ye take care of her, then she'll always take care of ye. Ye should understand that every ship has a spirit tied to her, born when the keel first be laid. The spirit and your ship be one and the same, and despite that ye can replace your keel, your mast and your sails, so long as her name ne'er be forgotten, then she be the same ship, and will do her best to see ye to wherever your destination be. <br/><br/>As alluded to, the first thing your ship need be a name. It should ne'er end in the letter "a", and once set it ne'er changes. Missing either one of these core tenets be a sure way to have your ship go to pieces on ye. This be because it be demons whose names end with a, and naming your ship after a demon curses all who sail aboard her. Changing her name once it be known makes her lose trust in ye. Ye have probably also noticed that ships always be referred to as being female. This simply be because the spirits that occupy ships only come in the feminine variety. <br/><br/>The ships bell be the housing of the spirit herself, or the ships soul as some like to think of it. Sounding the bell will keep ye protected from hostile influences, ghosts and devils. The bell sounding without a person's aid, howe'er, be the ship warning her crew that death be near. There be no truer omen of death than a ships bell ringing unbidden. Rescuing the bell from a capsized ship be a way to have another spirit watching over your own, but do nae hold onto her for too long. The spirit will grow restless unless she be given a new body to inhabit at the first opportunity. <br/><br/>There be quite a number of things to be aware of if ye be a shipwright also. Hiding an aureal somewhere in the keel be a way to ensure good fortune, and stealing this coin will bring bad fortune upon ye. A silver coin also be lain under a mast to represent the moon and ward against storms. Using stolen timbers to construct a boat be good luck, so long as they aren't stolen from nowhere holy. <br/><br/>Do nae place your left foot first when ye be boarding a boat, as this will bring bad luck, and this be multiplied if ye sneeze o'er your left shoulder while doing so. Howe'er a libation of alcohol poured on the deck will see that your voyage be a profitable one.

             Beasties and Spirits
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             <br/>Dolphins be the most romanticised beastie of the sea. Said to be as smart as any person, yet with the tail of a fish, and a voice like angels sound. Rum poured into the water will sometimes attract them to ye, and while they be insanely lucky to have around your boat, as well as preventing sharks from following ye, they also be  outrageous tricksters, who be happy to lure your ship to it's death if ye nae longer entertain them. <br/><br/>Sharks be notorious bad luck, and the main reason ye might wish to risk dolphins following ye. Nae only can they smell blood in the water, they can sense death afore it occurs. As such, sharks following in the wake of your boat be a indication that someone be about to die. <br/><br/>Turtles be a gift from the sea, and good eating. However, if ye kill a turtle but do nae eat it, then the sea will grow angry with ye. The bones of a turtle be imbued with the seas favour, and the shells make handsome hats, purify sea-water that be poured into them under the light of a full moon, and sell for a pretty penny to nobles in Akoma. <br/><br/>Manta rays be awful bad luck, being possessed of incredible strength. It be terrible stupid to weigh anchor when there be manta rays about, as they'll grab on and drag the ship and all her crew down to Davey Jones' locker. <br/><br/>Storm petrels and Albatrosses both be possessing the spirits of departed sailors. They'll often lead ye to land when ye be without a heading, and it be terrible unlucky to kill one. <br/><br/>Sea serpents be dangerous creatures, and the secrets of their control be known only to a select few. They be able to grow to sizes larger than most people can imagine, and their long bodies rising in and out of the water be mistaken for strings of islands more often than lubbers realise. They live tens of hundreds of years, and only those that be trained since hatching be able to be controlled. Luckily, this means that the only ones that be controlled be relatively small, nae bigger than a two mast warship. They be dreadful poisonous, both if they bite ye and if ye eat them, and the best way to cure their poison be by using jellyfish blood. <br/><br/>The Kraken be easily one of the most dangerous of the seas menagerie. A squid the size of a war galleon, it's tentacles able to reach out of the water and clear over the mast. There be few survivors of kraken attacks, though them that have survived speak of tentacles wrapping around the decks and dragging entire ships under the waves, often causing whirlpools as they plunge to the ocean depths to devour their prize. <br/><br/>As well as beasts, there be spirits of the sea that have import for sailors. The Sea herself be a spirit of sorts, and your ship possesses a spirit of her own. Other than that, the main spirits ye need worry about be the spirits of the dead, and the spirits of the wind. <br/><br/>Wind spirits all be male, and like all males they like to fill the fairer gender, wind spirits favouring especially the sails of ships. Whistling on deck draws wind spirits to ships, but this can be dangerous. Whistling too loud summons a whole heap of spirits, and they'll always bring a gale in their wake. Best way to calm them down be to give them what they be after, and have a woman show her gifts. <br/><br/>Old Wailey be one of the oldest wind spirits, and he and the sea always be fighting. Woe betide the sailor that interrupts one of their arguments, as the sea rises to attack the clouds in vicious spouts, and the sky attacks the sea right back with rain and lightning. The best way to survive one of these squalls, which be named such because it be a squabble between these spirits, be to have a woman bare her chest. Old Wailey will be distracted, and ye'll only have to deal with the sea being angry from that point on, unless the lass has red hair of course, in which case ye should have smooth sailing. <br/><br/>If ye encounter Old Wailey on his own, blowing hard and trying to incite the sea to violence, ye can distract him by the sacrifice of a land critter, pet comhachs unfortunately being a common victim when in such dire straits.

             <br/>Dolphins be the most romanticised beastie of the sea. Said to be as smart as any person, yet with the tail of a fish, and a voice like angels sound. Rum poured into the water will sometimes attract them to ye, and while they be insanely lucky to have around your boat, as well as preventing sharks from following ye, they also be  outrageous tricksters, who be happy to lure your ship to it's death if ye nae longer entertain them. <br/><br/>Sharks be notorious bad luck, and the main reason ye might wish to risk dolphins following ye. Nae only can they smell blood in the water, they can sense death afore it occurs. As such, sharks following in the wake of your boat be a indication that someone be about to die. <br/><br/>Turtles be a gift from the sea, and good eating. However, if ye kill a turtle but do nae eat it, then the sea will grow angry with ye. The bones of a turtle be imbued with the seas favour, and the shells make handsome hats, purify sea-water that be poured into them under the light of a full moon, and sell for a pretty penny to nobles in Akoma. <br/><br/>Manta rays be awful bad luck, being possessed of incredible strength.

             <br/>To calm the sea when she be angry, cut a ravens throat, pluck from it's warm body it's three longest feathers, tie them to a weight and drop them overboard. <br/><br/>If someone mentions the possibility of your ship being sunk, your ship be jinxed. To remove the jinx, spin around once and flick your nose with her left thumb. <br/><br/>Old Waily be the spirit of the squall, and he be calmed by a blood libation. <br/><br/>Golden earrings improve your eyesight. <br/><br/>Toasting the word practice whene'er it be uttered ensures that ye will nae have bad luck when attempting to woo a lass to your bed. <br/><br/>Stabbing a dagger into the mast and whistling softly past it be a way for those with the gift to summon a wind. Anyone without the power or training whistling on deck will bring ye violent winds and storms. <br/><br/>Any lass baring her breasts will distract the storm spirits from their duties, causing the storm to abate. <br/><br/>The best way to dispose of a dead man be to place the man and two cannonballs in his hammock at his feet and sewing the hammock shut. Thirteen stitches to close the hammock protect your dead shipmate from necromancy, and piercing the sailors nose with the thirteenth stitch ensures that he be dead before throwing him over the side. Make sure ye do nae throw him over parallel to the line joining the bow and stern of the ship. If ye do need to take a body ashore, it must be the first thing that be removed from the ship. <br/><br/>If a wine glass makes a sound of its own accord, it be a sign that the ship and crew will die. Smashing the glass and scattering the pieces on separate pieces of land can prevent this from being fulfilled. <br/><br/>Jellyfish blood be the only known cure for poisoning from a sea-serpent. <br/><br/>Flowers be bad luck on a ship, as they could be used to make a funeral wreath for one of your shipmates.
