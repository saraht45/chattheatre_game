             Beetles are the group of insects with the largest number of known kinds. They can be found in most any habitat, though rarely in sea, and polar regions.
They often feed on plants and fungi, and eat other insects. Most beetles are known to farmers as pests, as eat crops, but ladybugs are helpful as they eat the pests that damage crops.<br/><br/>The anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform, although specific appendages and known organs (from dissection) may vary. Not much is known about the functions of found organs, in any species of spider or insect. The beetle is divided into three sections, which are called, the head, thorax, and abdomen.<br/>When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle "section" is a hard plate, which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's wings.<br/>They have a hard outer shell, The beetle's outer shell is made up of numerous plates, separated by thin sutures. This design creates the armoured defences known of the beetle while maintaining flexibility. This hard shell must be raised in order to move the hind flight wings. A beetle's flight wings are crossed with veins and are folded after landing, often along these veins, and are stored underneath, though some beetles have lost the ability to fly, they are commonly called ground beetles.<br/>Beetles are laid as eggs, and grow into what we call larvae, until the final stage of development. They have an extremely variable lifespan from what I can tell.

          <Base:Description type="look">
             Ants are easily identified by their thin waist, and elbowed antennae. Ants form large colonies, and appear to work as a unified entity. Ants are seen living just about everywhere.<br/>Their success is often attributed to their social organization  and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves.<br/>Many cultures use ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals.<br/>Ants are found in all habitats on Calabria, except very freezing and inhospitable places. They can exploit a wide range of food sources, as plant eaters, predators, and scavengers.<br/>Colours vary from red, black, green, and many have a metallic luster.<br/>They have very distinct antennae. They have three segments to their body, and six legs.<br/>Ants work in distinct social classes. Soldiers, workers, queens, drones.<br/>Ants attack and defend themselves by biting, and stinging.

             Ants are easily identified by their thin waist, and elbowed antennae. Ants form large colonies, and appear to work as a unified entity. Ants are seen living just about everywhere.<br/>Their success is often attributed to their social organization  and their ability to modify habitats, tap resources, and defend themselves.<br/>Many cultures use ants in cuisine, medication, and rituals.<br/>Ants are found in all habitats on Calabria, except very freezing and inhospitable places.

             Such as locusts.<br/>Grasshoppers have antennae shorter than their body length. They can make noises by rubbing their legs or wings together, or by snapping their wings in flight. Their hind legs are long and strong, fitted for leaping. Generally they are winged, but not fit for flight. They have six stages of development, getting larger every time until fully grown. Grasshoppers and crickets eat primarily grass, and many other plants.<br/>Locusts are a common known pest to farmers, they can migrate in swarms in a very coordinated way, causing massive damage to crops. <br/>Many varieties are green, and so difficult to spot.<br/><br/>Crickets can chirp. Crickets are sometimes kept as pets, and considered good luck in some cultures. Cricket fighting is also a pastime.
