             an answer on What is a Spider?
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             Spiders are very different from other creatures. They have very distinguished features, such as four pairs of segmented legs, and a body composed of two parts, instead of three like other insects. They are carnivorous, feeding on other insects, and even other spiders. They are commonly known for having a poisonous bite, fangs to paralyze and kill. Most spiders weave sticky webs to capture their prey, which stick to the silk and become entangled. It is unknown how spiders do not stick to their own webs. Although, the spider silk is harder to mass produce like that of silk worms.<br/>Spiders come in many different sizes, from that of a coin, and in some cases it has been reported in freakish sizes. Recorded as the great 'spider itch plague' of Triskellion, which I will make more of a note later in a chapter of it's own.

As you may know, or come to find, spiders are involved in many stories and legends in many cultures. I've searched far and wide for all of these tiny creatures, and asked many locals for their take on, and any information about spiders.<br/>Spiders somtimes have a negative connotation, seen as 'tricksters', and in other cultures they are praised as a symbol of good luck. They are sometimes said to represent a connection between death, and rebirth. There are also quite a few tales and stories with spiders as characters, usually telling a moral at the end.

             It is my belief that we can use many insects, and even spiders, in medicine. The 'spider itch' aforementioned was actually cured by the use of the eggs, transforming it into a salve to heal the skin. Could they be used in other positive ways? Perhaps we can find ways to cure severe spider bites, or even other common disease. Bites can be painful, and often fatal in children and those in poor health. Leeches, and ants, can be used medicinally. Spider silk can be used to bandage wounds.

             I recently traveled to the city Triskellion to research the spider itch plague as soon as I caught wind of it. I spoke to a few doctors and those in the field of medicine who were witness to it. I came to learn that these spiders were twice the size of a horse, hitting hard with contagious poison, and leaving long lasting scars. The disease could remarkably be spread through touch and through the air. Symptoms primarily included itching, though untreated the itching became so severe causing loss of fur and skin. A few pet spiders were dissected at the time, though I am unable to find a specimen. They were noted as 'freakishly large', with long powerful legs, bit otherwise looked and acted like normal spiders.<br/>I procured a sample of the cure, which was a grease made from a dark grass, clean blood, and an egg from the spiders. It was a terrible epidemic, claiming lives, and the professionals are greatly thanked for their dedication to curing the sick.
