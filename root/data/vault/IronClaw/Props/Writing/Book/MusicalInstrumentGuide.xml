             A brass instrument is a wind instrument whose tone is produced by the vibration of lips as the player blows into a tubular resonator (mouthpiece). They do not have to be made of brass, but are usually made of some kind of metal, though they can also be made out of horn, wood, or even shell, depending on the instrument.<br/>

          <Base:Description type="look">
             Made out of a conch shell, the horagai is a most unique instrument. Unlike most instruments made out of conch shells that only produce one sound, the horagai can produce three or four distinctly different notes. The process of making a horagai out of a conch shell is a guarded secret, but has to do with the attachment of a bronze or wooden mouthpiece to the apex of the conch's spire. The horagai is most well-known for its use by Lutarist priestesses in rituals. It also is used by Lutarist paladins to signal their presence (or movements) to each other across moutaintops and other long distances. There is a secret code among Lutarist paladins to signal different movements and messages, created with varying combinations of the  three or four notes of the horagai.<br/>

             Natural horns are those created using only the ivory of horned lizards. They may be utilitarian only, having just the one small change to create a blowing hole, or they may be ornate, having carved scenes or designs upon them. Depending on the lizard the horn is taken from, it may be any variant of shade from black  through brown and tan to pure white. These are used mostly for hunting parties and in war, to signal movements or presence, though they are sometimes used to draw a crowd's attention to a tournament or other large event.<br/><br/>
The pitch of the natural horn is controlled by air speed, aperture, and the use of the right hand moving in and out of the bell.<br/>

          <Base:Description type="look">
             This rather extraordinary instrument consists of a long tube of metal with a slide that can be pushed and pulled to change the pitch. It has a mouthpiece with a flat rim, shallow cup, and narrow aperture.<br/><br/>
The sacbut is best suited for playing with loud ensembles out of doors, as well as with soft ensembles indoors. It is a great addition to any ensemble with shawms and trumpets. It can make a loud, brassy sound or a more delicate, vocal timbre. This instrument is the replacement of the much more difficult to play slide trumpet.<br/><br/>
This is an instrument that should only be played by a skilled musician, so that it does not sound like a trumpet, but rather more like the common voice; it must not have a warlike, rather than a peaceful, sound.<br/><br/>
The sacbut can also be employed, if played by a skilled musician, in a church setting, to bring extra volume to the music. In this setting, it -must- be played softly to imitate the sound of a human voice, as a warlike trumpet sound would be disasterous during a hymn. As well, sacbuts are excellent for announcing the beginning of festivities or the coming of a procession, and in this way is perfectly suited to be played beside the trumpet.<br/>

          <Base:Description type="look">
             The shofar is the ritual instrument of the Ancients.  According to ancient texts, two styles of shofar were used. The first was made of ivory, its bell ornamented with gold, and this horn was blown at the New Year's and on the first day of the harvest. The other, also made of ivory but ornamented with silver, was sounded on fast days. The ritual shofar may be no shorter than three hands, and no alteration were allowed to the instrument design to change the tone (no ornamentation on the interior, plugging of holes, change of length, or anything else that might change its tone).<br/><br/>
Besides its use in rituals, the shofar was also known for its holiness, its power to  call down the god against enemies. It is said in ancient texts that shofar blowers would sound a mighty war cry to instill fear in the hearts of the enemy, while priests blew upon the six trumpets of killing, legendary trumpets said to have magical powers given to them by their god, to strike down the enemy before even one arrow flew.<br/><br/>
In the modern Church, the shofar blowing is restricted to celebration of the New Year and the first day of harvest. Use of the shofar for magical purposes is strictly forbidden, and carries a heavy penalty.<br/><br/>
The shofar is made like a natural horn, but has six finger holes to aid in the playing of notes.<br/>

             The shofar is the ritual instrument of the Ancients.  According to ancient texts, two styles of shofar were used. The first was made of ivory, its bell ornamented with gold, and this horn was blown at the New Year's and on the first day of the harvest. The other, also made of ivory but ornamented with silver, was sounded on fast days. The ritual shofar may be no shorter than three hands, and no alteration were allowed to the instrument design to change the tone (no ornamentation on the interior, plugging of holes, change of length, or anything else that might change its tone).<br/><br/>

             Made of a long tube of metal with a metal or wooden mouthpiece much like that of the sacbut, the trumpet, also called the straight horn, can vary in length from one to six feet. The longer the trumpet, the harder to play. Shorter trumpets are used in ensembles with shawms and sacbuts, while longer trumpets are employed by heralds at tournaments, festivals, and to lead processions. The longer, heraldic trumpets often have a silk banner hanging from the tube with the heraldry of the player's patron. This instrument can be very loud, and has a strong metallic sound which, if played well enough, can be heard clearly from one side of a city to the other.<br/>
