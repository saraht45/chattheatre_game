This single tress is tied with a ribbon and laid to the front of the left shoulder.<br/><br/> ~ Steep Crown: A style in which the hair rises steeply, curling high and back from the hairline and reaching for the crown. The sides are combed straight back, thinly covering the top of the ears and bending in towards the neck.<br/><br/> ~ Tiered Bun: Gathered in a loose bun, the hair is curled and situated in such a way as to provide the image of several tiers atop one another.<br/>

These plaited arrangements are then drawn around the circumference of the head and secured in the back where the rest of the hair hangs unrestrained.<br/><br/> ~ Shag: A short, layered, loose hairstyle, with more layers at the crown of the head than below. The ears are not cut out so that the hair can be conveniently tucked behind or pulled back with barrettes or hairpins.<br/><br/> ~ Spiked Swell: A male style in which longer hair decorates the crown of the head before being directed upward and towards the front.

The hair is layered with greater lengths on the crown and neck.<br/><br/> ~ Swirl-top Bun: The hair has been parted down the middle and collected into individual strands before being combed upward, rolled under, and invisibly pinned. From the back to the front, large, decorative swirls fashionably claim both sides of the head.<br/><br/> ~ Tight Rows: A tightly-woven style in which the braided hair is pressed closely to the scalp, creating a decorative, raised surface. The hair is weaved over the crown of the head where it then splits into individually-created snug braids.<br/><br/> ~ Uplifted: An elegant bulge of the long frontal hair is just the prelude to the crescendo of long and luxurious curls, coiled to perfection right below the shoulders. The symmetry and simplicity are an open play in contrast to the extreme control on the lifted top section.

             ~ Braided Bun Wrap: The tresses are tied off-center at the back of the head, widely braided, and then wrapped loosely about the crown before being decoratively knotted into a bun.<br/><br/> ~ Crisscross Knot with Tendrils: The larger majority of hair along the front and sides is elegantly criss-crossed before trailing downward to the base of the head where it is coiled into a braided nape knot. The remaining straight tresses loosely frame the face and neck in delicate tendrils.<br/><br/> ~ Five Strand Braid: An intricate, braided style created by using five strands of hair rather than three.<br/><br/> ~ Gathered Ringlets: Hair that has been swept back at the nape into a pile of loosely gathered tendrils.<br/><br/> ~ Layered with Bangs:Hair which has been cut into longer layers on the front and sides, and shorter layers in the back, to achieve a sleek, tapered effect. Cheek-length wispy bangs soften the style, gently curling inward to frame the face.<br/><br/> ~ Ribbon Laced Braids: A style in which the hair has been parted into two separate sections and french braided. A wide ribbon is then criss-crossed through the mid-section and wound downward before unifying the two braids and securing them in place.<br/><br/> ~ Scalp Cut: A hairstyle which takes its inspiration from the classic bowl cut with its clearly defined terminus around the skull. The bottom edge of the style parallels the parietal ridge with a to-the-scalp cut beneath. The look includes the shadow of the traditional perimeter of the hair, and the upper sections are cut in a uniform length to create a velvety texture.<br/><br/> ~ Swept Back Curls: The hair has been divided into a partial, where a simple, braided bun has been pressed to the crown of the head with a series of pins, leaving the rest of the hair to frame the face and flow freely over the back and shoulders in a mess of natural, languid curls.<br/>

             ~ Caged Braids: A loose style featuring a myriad of incredibly intricate, dainty braids caging the hair back.<br/><br/> ~ Knotted Chignon: An array of knotted locks are neatly arranged in what looks like a net criss-crossing toward the back from the front of the head before being twisted into a tight chignon.<br/><br/> ~ Layered with Swoop: A style in which the hair features short layers in the back, tapering inward toward the neck, and chin-length layers on the sides. The bangs have been arranged so that they swoop down over the forehead area before draping elegantly over one eyebrow.<br/><br/> ~ Loose Wave: A soft, loose, and bouffant style in which the hair is smoothed into languid waves that tumble to the shoulders. The top section is straight and divides off-center into two portions. One section sweeps out in a graceful curve while the other plunges headlong down the forehead, across the eyebrow, and over the top of the cheek before melting into the main mass of locks.<br/><br/> ~ Side Veil: A deeply-textured asymmetrical bob style. The fringe area is curved downward to veil the right side of the face and carefully feathered with a razor to create a gentle upturn in the ends of the hair. The right side tapers to a point below the chin and is styled to form a petal shape that turns outward from the face. This is echoed in a shorter length by the left side of the style.<br/>

The back is traditionally secured with hair combs or hairpins and can be dressed up with the addition of flowers.<br/><br/> ~ Gathered Curls with Swoop: A sweep of bangs drape featherly over the right brow with the remaining tresses brought about the crown of the head where the under layer is thickly braided to encircle the delicately curled upper layer of hair.<br/><br/> ~ Halo with Curls: An elegant arrangement of loose curls frame the face while an off-center halo braid slackly encircles the front of the head.<br/><br/> ~ Pompadour: An elegant hairstyle where the sides of the hair are combed back, while the top is fanned forward and curled over itself.<br/>

Each braided loop has been decoratively strung with a black satin ribbon and strings of miniature black beads to create a complex spiderweb effect.<br/><br/> ~ Twist with Bangs: A glamorous upstyle in which the hair is parted on the side to create a long, silky sweep of bangs that cross the forehead in a wave, graze the eyebrow, and slip neatly behind the ear.
