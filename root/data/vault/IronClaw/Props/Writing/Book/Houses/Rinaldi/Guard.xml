          <Base:Description type="look">
             Chapter II: Duties<br/><br/>These duties are expected to be performed by all members of the Rinaldi Guard, they are:<br/><br/>- Protect members of the Rinaldi: The purpose of the Guard is to protect members of the Rinaldi and the Rinaldi's interests. If a person or building is being harrassed or harmed, it is our job to step in and handle the situation. We do not have the authority to arrest or fine anyone and we should not interfere in matters that do not involve the Rinaldi directly. That is what the Constabulary is for. If someone (with honor) is insulting the Rinaldi, we can ask for an apology. If they do not give an apology, we can challenge them to a duel. If they choose not to accept, they will be labeled a coward and it is assumed that they are taking back their offensive words. (See rules on dueling for more information). Avoid arguing to make yourself sound right. The only time this is remotely acceptable is if you are defending the honor of the House or a member of the House, but you should always be the better person and avoid arguments or allowing yourself to be provoked into a negative reaction. We represent the House even moreso than most other House members as we are seen in Oldtown, Newtown, and Docktown. You are expected to represent the House well.<br/><br/>- Patrol daily: Upon being recruited, guards will be assigned an area in the city to patrol daily (OOC: This can be bluebooked, although for the sake of RP do you should do the patrol sometimes).<br/><br/>- Write weekly reports: Guards are to write reports of their observations. If a week has gone by without any notable events, that still needs to be reported.<br/><br/>- Train: All members should find training outside the House even though there is weekly training sessions.<br/><br/>-Officer Training: All members sergeant and under are expected to attend officer training, if you cannot be sure to let a higher ranking member (preferrably the Captain) know. Lieutenants are not required to attend, but it is recommended for the sake of remembering what was taught.<br/><br/>- Attend meetings: It is unreasonable to expect all members to attend all meetings but attempts should be made. If a member is unable to attend a meeting, an officer (meaning sergeants and lieutenants) or Captain should be contacted and told such.

             Chapter III: Conduct

          <Base:Description type="look">
             Chapter III: Conduct<br/><br/>In addition to the duties listed on the previous chapter, all guards are expected to conduct themselves as men and women of civil nature. While we understand that those you will often interact with have no interest in civility or etiquette, guards are expected to rise above the fray and be the better man. Expected behavior includes, but is not limited to:<br/><br/>- Respect for Nobility: Whether of the Great House of Rinaldi, another Great House or even perhaps a Minor House, all members of the nobility are to be extended courtesy and respect at all times. They are your betters and you will acknowledge that through your actions. Bow to known nobility. Address them according to their social rank (when in doubt, "my lord/lady" is always safe). If they require assistance of any sort, render it, even if it means performing a menial task you might otherwise consider beneath you. Offer escort through dangerous areas. As you continue to conduct yourself in a matter befitting a member of genteel society, you will earn the respect of your betters. Continued failure to respect nobility may result in a dishonorable discharge.<br/><br/>- Public Behavior: Do not engage in frivolous and untoward activities. Always present yourself as a respectable member of society. To be a Rinaldi Guard does not mean that you must only impress your superiors and comrades. You are the face of the Rinaldi wherever you go. If your reputation is tarnished, the reputation of the Guard and the House is tarnished in turn. Even when in the company of other freedmen act with grace and honor. Do not engage in public rowdiness. Do not drink to excess. Do not fraternize with members of the same or opposite sex in such a way that others may speak ill of you. Continued failure to act befitting of the Guard may result in a dishonorable discharge.<br/><br/>- Interaction with Other Members of the Guard: One cannot enter a martial organization and expect to not adhere to a chain of command. Explained elsewhere, this chain is vital to the functioning of the Guard and it is built upon respect. To this end, you will always greet a superior with a salute, much as a jousting knight will raise his visor to salute his opponent. Superiors will be addressed by their rank and never by their given name alone. Same ranking members should also be greeted with a salute, and will be addressed as "Miss" or "Mister" unless they say otherwise. Romantic relationships with fellow guards is highly frowned upon, such can lead to distractions from duty. Failure to follow chain of command WILL result in a dishonorable discharge.
