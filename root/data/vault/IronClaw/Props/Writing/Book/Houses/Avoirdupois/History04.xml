             Aubert relied heavily on the talents of his uncle Amical (now called "the Kingmaker"), whose silver tongue was instrumental in defusing a number of challenges to the new king's authority. While Amical worked in the shadows, Aubert set about ordering his kingdom. One of his first decrees made the citadel overlooking the city of Sauldre his official residence. He spent large sums beautifying the city, and encouraged his subjects to do the same. Much of the city's remarkable architecture dates from this period. Outside the capital, work on the network of roads begun by General Gage (Aubert's grandfather) resumed.

             Under Paien I and his successors, Paien II, Aubert II, Paien III, the Avoirdupois kingdom grew steadily stronger. The Aoreilles (a tribe of rabbits in the south) and the Lissemanteau (a family of ermines in the Loire region) were absorbed during the reigns of Paien II and Aubert II, respectively. After capitulating, both families were permitted to rule their own lands as vassals of the Avoirdupois kings. Similarly, when his armies were unable to take the city of Enclume by force, Paien III granted the "free" city a royal charter, allowing the devolution of certain rights and powers to its governing council (dominated by the armadillo families known as the Casque), in return for their recognition of his supreme authority.

Three of Gan's older brothers had died in Paien's wars of conquest, leaving him with few illusions about the cost of his predecessors' expansionist policies. Wisely, he turned his attentions inward, reforming the Avoirdupois legal codes and generally strengthening the power of the monarchy. He encouraged learning, founding schools of law and medicine. Religiously tolerant, Gan even allowed the Penitents of S'allumer to build a chapel in the city of Sauldre.
