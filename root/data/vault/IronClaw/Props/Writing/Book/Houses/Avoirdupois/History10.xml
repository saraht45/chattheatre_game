             A graver crisis began with a disputed inheritance in the dimesne of the Marteau. Harbin du Marteau, a cousin of Duke Ombrage du Marteau, died in 722 and the provisions of his will left land and money for the founding of a new monastery near the village of Ascetique. There were several irregularities in the will, which had been completed in something of a rush, and Duke Ombrage--in keeping with the laws of the Accord de Gerance Avoirdupois--petitioned to have it set aside. Ombrage's case was strong, and Archduke Prevoyance may well have ruled in his favor if events had not taken an unexpected turn.
