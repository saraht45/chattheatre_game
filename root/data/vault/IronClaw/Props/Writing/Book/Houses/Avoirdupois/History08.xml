I am thirsty, so I make my way between the gnarled trees, searching for a stream so that I might drink. After much wandering, I chance to see a light in the distance. As I draw closer, I see that it is a clearing, bathed in a pure and brilliant light. At first I am dazzled by the brilliance, but when my vision clears there is a vulpine maiden standing before me. She is dressed in purple robes, and with both hands she holds a chalice brimming with cool water... though I am unbearably thirsty, I cannot bring myself to enter the clearing. Reluctantly, I turn away into the forest. A breeze rustles the branches of the trees, and as the wind grows to a great roar I am swept away."

As she walked, those of pure heart could discern about her a dazzling radiance that grew brighter with each step...

             As the holy woman passed through the camp, the king was roused from his tent by the commotion. At first sight of the dazzling light, he fell to his knees... When Luzia reached the king, he stood and led her within the tent where his dear wife lay dying. Luzia took the queen's hands in her own, and the light of purity and creation enveloped them both. In barely a moment, the ravages of disease were lifted from the queen's body and she awoke, calling for her beloved husband.
