             Once named general of the allied forces, Gage requisitioned every available jennet, courser, and palfrey and recognized the various family militias as mounted infantry. Some popular accounts portray Gage as leading a host of cavalry, but historical sources clearly show that the battles of this period were primarily fought on foot. Gage also established a network of messengers and signal towers that kept him well apprised of developments across the realm. Together, these innovations allowed him to follow the movements of the Ecorcheurs from a safe distance and to maneuver his forces swiftly in response.

             By the following spring, Gage was ready to confront the Ecorcheurs directly. More families had joined his alliance, and his troops had gained much-needed experience and confidxence from skirmishes with the nomads. Gage maneuvered carefully: he had no intention of engaging in any battles not of his choosing. On the last day of the month of Flowers, he attacked the Ecorcheur near the shores of Lake Aube.

             The battle was fierce and bloody, with heavy losses on both sides. Gage lost his shield hand, and even the mighty leader of the Ecorcheur was wounded. By the end of the day, it was the Ecorcheur who were forced to withdraw from the field. While technically victorious, Gage is said to have remarked that "another such victory will leave us a nation of ghosts." Nevertheless, he grimly set about preparing for a second battle.

             In the subsequent weeks, it was rumored that the leader of the Ecorcheurs was weakening: his wounds were not healing properly and he suffered from fevers. A popular story tells how the chief, rather than succumb to the infection that had spread throughout his body, removed himself to a "secret place" where, amidst the splendor of his plundered wealth, he killed his wives and then himself. The continuing popularity of the story is probably connected with the possibility of finding the hidden treasure. Most scholars discount the story, considering it more likely that the Ecorcheur chief either succumbed to his wounds or was murdered by an ambitious lieutenant.
