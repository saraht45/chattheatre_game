             Unlike most of his contemporaries, Amical preferred the "soft art" of diplomacy to the ways of the war. With carefully chosen words he rewarded his allies, isolated his enemies, and turned his brother's successes on the battlefield into lasting advantages. In 155 Amical proposed a formal agreement among his allies to standardize their boundaries and laws. Over the next seven years, the other families were enticed (and in some cases, coerced) into signing a more general version of the original treaty.

             The revised treaty was known as the Accord de Gerance Avoirdupois, or the "Accord for the Governing of Owned Goods." The terms of the agreement established a common law regarding the ownership and transferal of property. Since many of the most pernicious disputes between the families were rooted in disputes over land, it was hoped that the agreement would prevent future disagreements and allow the return of peace. In time, the treaty would lend its name to the people it bound together, and the descendants of the 27 signing families would be collectively known as the Avoirdupois.

Playing upon the fears of the smaller factions, Amical cultivated support for the creation of a monarch to rule over the various families. Amical's brother Paien was considered the natural choice for the position, but he died in the spring of 165, only weeks before his planned coronation.
