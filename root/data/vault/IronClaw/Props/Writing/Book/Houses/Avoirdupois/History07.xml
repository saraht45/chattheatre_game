             The Avoirdupois had always worshiped Anu and All-Father to their family shrines, but only since the establishment of the monarchy had any kind of formal priestly heirarchy arisen. Theudebald l'Anuite, a contemporary of King Paien I, is credited with reshaping the practices of the religion into their modern forms. Leaving his home in Porteur-du-Soleil, Theudebald traveled the countryside, promulgating his interpretations of the secred lore. He endorsed a simplified form of the ancient rules of the caste, and reformed the priesthood so that women were no longer permitted within its ranks. He also encouraged the study of magic, and of Elementalism in particular. When Theudebald died in 221, his body was returned to Porteur-du-Soleil, and his followers began the construction of a memorial to house his remains. As time passed, the structure continued to grow, eventually becoming the sprawling Heliopolitan temple that dominates Porteur-du-Soleil today.

             For a few weeks, it seemed possible that question of the succession would plunge the country into another civil war. Tensions rose between the priestly and noble factions, but eventually they agreed that Duke Etienne du Sabot would be the next king of the Avoirdupois. Etienne's mother was one of King Gan's great-grandchildren and a cousin of both Paien IV and Evrouin I, so this legal claim was on sound footing, but he knew that he was not the first choice of either faction. With the coming of spring, the new king led the Avoirdupois armies into the Rinaldi heartland. The crusader legions were now protected by the jennet-mounted knights of the king's guard, and the Rinaldi lancers were no longer able to achieve the easy victories they had grown accustomed to the previous summer. The Avoirdupois advanced inexorably, pushing the Rinaldi back to the very walls of Triskellian. after a direct assault of the city failed disastrously, both sides settled in for a long siege.

             For a few weeks, it seemed possible that question of the succession would plunge the country into another civil war. Tensions rose between the priestly and noble factions, but eventually they agreed that Duke Etienne du Sabot would be the next king of the Avoirdupois. Etienne's mother was one of King Gan's great-grandchildren and a cousin of both Paien IV and Evrouin I, so this legal claim was on sound footing, but he knew that he was not the first choice of either faction. With the coming of spring, the new king led the Avoirdupois armies into the Rinaldi heartland. The crusader legions were now protected by the jennet-mounted knights of the king's guard, and the Rinaldi lancers were no longer able to achieve the easy victories they had grown accustomed to the previous summer. The Avoirdupois advanced inexorably, pushing the Rinaldi back to the very walls of Triskellian. after a direct assault of the city failed disastrously, both sides settled in for a long siege.
