Over the course of nine months, the bishops decided upon an official doctrine for the church (other views were declared either heterodox or heretical) and reorganized the church heirarchy into something similar to its current form. Henceforth, each region would be overseen by an Archbishop. The most senior Archbishop would be recognized as the official head of the church, the Pontiff of S'allumer.
