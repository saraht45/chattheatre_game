The leader of the Denegateurs, Searlait, is said to have told Chlotar that he "should have brought a sword instead of these leaves," referring to the deeds and patents he carried. the word "leaf" became a popular derisive term for Gurlan's deeds, and today the civil war is known as the "War of Leaves."

Ambitious commoners supported Gurlan and the king, seeing the new policy as a way to gain wealth and status, while disenfranchised nobles joined Aluin's army, and the most desperate of the peasantry supported the Denegateurs. No faction was strong enough to defeat the others outright, and the war dragged on for years. Old and famous lineages were extinguished. New families were ennobled, only to be disenfranchised or killed a month later. One stretch of land east of sauldre was the site of five distinct battles during the course of the war.

             In her letters (a few of which have survived to the present day), Itta stressed that wars and battles were not won in the same way. She wrote that "mere cunning" can win battles, but only "virtue" can inspire the loyalty necessary to create peace. When Paien offered her a title, Itta declined, asking instead that the practice of issuing deeds and patents be stopped "before the entire kingdom lies barren, the fields salted with the blood of folly." Eventually, Paien agreed, and the plates that had been used to print the "leaves" were broken in a public ceremony on the 8th day of the month of Flowers, in the year 349.

             Paien did not enjoy his victory for long: he finally succumbed to his long illness a few months later. His friend Itta, who had lost an arm in the final battle, was greatly saddened by his death and became something of a recluse. She did not give up writing, however, and many years later her letters would be collected into two volumes: Feudalism, which dealt with her theories of society and government, and Chivalry, which was more concerned with personal conduct of morality.
