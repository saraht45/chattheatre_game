             Day 1 - Jeudi, 5th of Grass
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             "Day 1 - Jeudi, 5th of Grass<br/><br/> We arrived at the marketplace as planned after a brief argument between Mistress diDraco and Miss Evette. Evette cannot speak the common tongue and so would be a liability. I've already had enough paperwork to deal with, more would just be a nuisance which I was not willing to deal with minutes before leaving, especially when my nerves were fluttering in my stomach alongside the sick feeling you get as a pregnant mother, I was surprised I hadn't revealed the entire contents of my innards to the whole world. No, that's a bit too graphical, I feel sick just writing about it. Carrying on...<br/><br/> After waiting almost an hour the guide finally arrived, a panda by the name of Tao. He acted sort of twitchy, it was not long before I deemed him untrustworthy, but he brought us to the correct place, regardless. After debating who the swords in the area were, Tao finally let us keep a hold of them; Dio was particularly keen on hoarding them for himself. The guide eventually left us, promising to return in a weeks time so as to guide us back, though I assume the punt by the river will do just as well.<br/><br/> We'd only been here ten minutes, some had laid down to rest, and others were up and raring to go, I could barely raise my voice over the clamor. It was not long before Caelith headed out into the swamp, followed close behind by Prestimion. Dio had the nerve to sneak out after them, being merely a scholar himself. For a while, at least is seemed like a while, Mistress diDraco argued with Kira about not having anyone to protect us, I'm sure Miss Lazul was not happy about that, regardless, they quietened down and it was not long before the men arrived, those that left that is. I admit, I was not in the fettle for their petty excuses, I would have preferred it if they had waited and thought out a proper plan. I regret snapping at everyone, especially Pres, he did not deserve my hostility, perhaps my petty excuse might be because of the child growing down there and the long one hour journey I had to endure. I firmly told Dio off for leaving the grounds, he is not a scout, he was not marked down as a scout, therefore he won't act as a scout. I have half the mind to keep a constant watch over him. Another thing to add, I was largely miffed to note Dio had picked from the swamp some flowers before the rest of us could personally have a look, later on I discovered that these flowers are common to this area and not that hard to find, to Dios fortune.<br/><br/> For a time we next debated whether to enter the swamps as a whole or in groups, it was decided that going in groups would be a good idea, the scouts, Caelith and Prestimion had both confirmed to seeing nothing of great danger within the terrain. I was quite surprised to be deferred to as the leader, even by those ranking higher than me, whether or not I am the organizer of this expedition. And, as was expected of me, I set in stone (not literally) who would be in what group (later this idea was disregarded and some just left the confines of the camp even if they didn't have specific permission or protection). Leaving the rest of the group sleeping, making sure that they were safe; Dame Valara, Caelith and Dio made their way out whilst Prestimion, Meepers, Kira and I took another branch.<br/><br/> Stepping out into the shallow, but fresh, water, I first noticed the varieties of plants that clustered the area. Hemlock, Cattail and Bulrush seem to be the common range that litters the area. More will be investigated on those when I return to the city, I'll make sure... No need to write up personal notes, I know what I'm doing. We trudged around the bog for a while, taking care where to step, you could never tell where the land rose or fell. Kira lit a torch, I left mine in my satchel, it was not yet pitch dark and I wished to reserve it lest we find ourselves lost to where to go. Though I have good faith in hid abilities. It is interesting how one can switch between present tense and past tense... Though that is not the point, he guided us, looking to the stars; the land is not that helpful when it always looks so similar in all directions. As night fell into the deeper folds of the day we begin to trek our way back. Pres voiced his concerns about losing the trail, you could have guessed how sick with worry I was feeling, it had me jumping at the slightest noise despite his presence.<br/><br/> Stepping back into camp was an interesting thing, though not of the better sort. Caelith was missing. Dame Valara informed me that he had requested to go out by himself, by his own decision, therefore not my responsibility, I was not there to stop him. He infuriates me so. Dio was boasting over the bullfrog he had found, and the mosquito also, pestering us with the frogs incessant croaks and the mosquito buzzing and bites. Once the mosquito had been sated, both Kira and Pres took their leave of the circle by the fire to rest. I was tempted to go back to Pres's side and sleep myself, but I was determined to wait it out till Caelith arrived back, if he arrived back, however he did. Before this Dame Valara, Dame Grazia and Dio had all taken their leave of the camp to explore what they could. When Caelith did arrive he brought back with him some lizards and more bees trailing behind him, Meepers had previously found herself a bee to play with. At that point I was too weary to both trying to tell him off before he strode back out on his own. Arriving back soon after, he reported fighting a giant spider, one too heavy and big to drag alongside him; it had given him quite the bruise to the jaw. Serves him right. He shouldn't have left the campsite alone. I can feel a sigh building in my chest but I shall stubbornly refrain from revealing my wistfulness and retire to the warm arms of my other half.<br/><br/> That reminds me... a scroll I had found from Althea... She claims she loves him, she claims she's dead. One would have to wonder how one could write a letter to the... love of their life whilst dead. I don't understand. I couldn't stay mad at Pres, I couldn't confront him about it. To be honest, I had completely forgotten about it until I started thinking about lying in the arms he had likely wrapped around another. I'm pausing, gazing at the fire, like you do. Meepers is tending to Caelith's injuries and the rest are sleeping, or out on their on short trips. I hope they don't notice, I would hate to show a sign of weakness as their leader. Regardless, this is what Pres has done and I must be over it. There is the child coming, Pres calls it Bubs, that puts a smile on my face... but I can't help but have this small niggling in the back of my mind telling me to run... run far away, never to be back, to go home. I wonder where home is, Pres'll tell me it's here with him... well, not here here, but... here as in with him as a family... I might like that."<br/>

             Day 2 - Vendredi, 6th of Grass
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             "Day 2 - Vendredi, 6th of Grass:<br/><br/> I awoke to see Meepers, Fips and Balia awake, they informed me that Caelith and Kira had been out in the swamp for quite a while, fishing I think the reason was. I was utterly ravenous, still eating the bread, cheese and drinking my lemongrass tea when Kira and Caelith arrived with the fish. Momentarily teased for eating so much when I have two mouths to feed, I have a perfectly reasonable... reason, excuse rather. I listened to the mornings conversation and head that Fips and Jahren had left previously, coming in contact with a spider. Fips looked absolutely petrified, especially with the comments Kira and Balia kept making about how delicious Fips might taste. This was just after Caelith had left in search of some fish to eat for dinner, but when he did return, I offered my knife to Balia in able for her to gut them. The smell had me reeling, I can feel the bile returning just thinking of it. She's assured me that the gutting of the fish will be done away from the space by the campfire, warm innards aren't the best smell to be around whilst suffering from morning sickness. With that, my tea was gone and more rest was rightly needed.<br/><br/> Woken by the scent of roasted fish I feasted, craving for the taste to fill my belly which I was entirely grateful for, Balia has cooked up a delicious meal from the fish Caelith brought back. I ventured out a few times, once with Meepers and Dio. Not a lot came from that trip, though we discovered a few clay pits. I again left with Meepers as Dio rested, but we could come across nothing new than what had already been seen on previous trips. I know I shouldn't have, but I went out into the swamp on my own against the doctors orders. A devious grinned is placed on my face, yes, I know it was a bad thing to do and Pres has warned me that those with child can act irrationally... my apologies. Since others had fished I decided to try my hand at it... and got a large handful of slimy, gooey weeds, nothing else.<br/><br/> When I finally returned, Caelith thought it a good idea to tell me off for going out on my own, he informed me he were under orders to protect me specifically... wow, things couldn't get any worse, could they? Though the good thing to know was that someone that didn't attend wanted me safe, regardless of whom it was protecting me and how miserable he was making life here for me. Despite that, I joined both him and Balia, despite the fact the rest of us have suspicions about what they both did the previous night whilst alone in the swamps, to see if we could find a spider. I am yet to find one. He makes those slight remarks, and then he doesn't make them at all, he completely secludes me in a place already almost entirely remote, it had just gotten worse. I endured it, of course I did, I wasn't going to let him ruin my time there, he should be grateful that he could attend me at all.<br/><br/> As soon as Pres had raised his very own eyelids, Caelith was intend on telling him of my mischief, but Pres simply understood and asked me to go alongside him otherwise. Caelith was shot down. I can't help but feel some sort of satisfaction, it is not his trip, it is mine, but I really should have waited until Pres had awoken. After a moments confusion, both Pres and I set out, we soon came upon a dead end after a few stops to stall our desires until somewhere more convenient. There isn't really a convenient place in the swamps to make love, standing was the preferred coarse of action, and action it certainly was, I can still feel my cheeks glowing and my the blood flowing through my lips from the heightened sensitivity. It's amazing how one's desire can take over the rational thinking of one's usual self. Anyway... I'm getting lost whilst reliving those moments, quite exciting... danger, desire, inconvenient location. I'll leave it there with that smirk lingering.<br/><br/> So, after returning safely and settling down to listen to Balia's lewd songs, I take my leave."<br/>

Since others had fished I decided to try my hand at it... and got a large handful of slimy, gooey weeds, nothing else.<br/><br/> When I finally returned, Caelith thought it a good idea to tell me off for going out on my own, he informed me he were under orders to protect me specifically... wow, things couldn't get any worse, could they? Though the good thing to know was that someone that didn't attend wanted me safe, regardless of whom it was protecting me and how miserable he was making life here for me. Despite that, I joined both him and Balia, despite the fact the rest of us have suspicions about what they both did the previous night whilst alone in the swamps, to see if we could find a spider. I am yet to find one. He makes those slight remarks, and then he doesn't make them at all, he completely secludes me in a place already almost entirely remote, it had just gotten worse. I endured it, of course I did, I wasn't going to let him ruin my time there, he should be grateful that he could attend me at all.<br/><br/> As soon as Pres had raised his very own eyelids, Caelith was intend on telling him of my mischief, but Pres simply understood and asked me to go alongside him otherwise. Caelith was shot down. I can't help but feel some sort of satisfaction, it is not his trip, it is mine, but I really should have waited until Pres had awoken. After a moments confusion, both Pres and I set out, we soon came upon a dead end after a few stops to stall our desires until somewhere more convenient. There isn't really a convenient place in the swamps to make love, standing was the preferred coarse of action, and action it certainly was, I can still feel my cheeks glowing and my the blood flowing through my lips from the heightened sensitivity. It's amazing how one's desire can take over the rational thinking of one's usual self. Anyway... I'm getting lost whilst reliving those moments, quite exciting... danger, desire, inconvenient location. I'll leave it there with that smirk lingering.<br/><br/> So, after returning safely and settling down to listen to Balia's lewd songs, I take my leave."<br/>

             Day 3 - Samedi, 7th of Grass

          <Base:Description type="look">
             "Day 3 - Samedi, 7th of Grass:<br/><br/> On waking this morning, Meeps made sure I was well fed on fruit and fish, a delicious meal and much more gratifying since the fish were gutted by the river. I was looking forward to a time out in the swamp and I hoped to spot myself a spider. Filling myself with my share of fish and tea I offered to lead another trip into the swamps.<br/><br/> Fips, Kira, Caelith and I left to the swamps, and to my greatest pleasure, we came across a spider, it wouldn't have bothered with us if Caelith hadn't attacked it in the first place, all it was doing was watching the hole the lizards lived in. I really wanted to stay and see if we could take the spider down, however, it seems to large to be brought down by a scout, guard, gardener and pregnant woman. Reluctantly, we decided to withdraw until there were more martially based awake to help us.<br/><br/> On the next expedition, Dame Valara took the lead... and got us lost. It was both amusing and exhausting, at one point I even had to have Balia lift me over her shoulders. Meepers went on Kira's shoulders. It was refreshing just to let go of my usual dignity and have fun. After a moments rest, I decided I ought to take the lead, I managed to return everyone safely, though Caelith decided to go his separate way, like usual.<br/><br/> Regardless of my fitness, I headed right back out with Dio in search of spiders, it took a good three looks around the swamp to find one. Meepers joined us on our third trip out. The spider didn't bother with us until Dio attacked it, I tried to warn him, and when he was unable to continue fighting, and when Meepers was thoroughly frightened, I had to step in and save the day. Sometimes I wonder why I do these things, a single hit to the face and the spider recoiled, afraid to attack us further. Well, when Dio got his picture drawn we made our hasty retreat and returned to camp.<br/><br/> Before long we heard a shout from the bushes surrounding the camp, it was a foreign voice, one we hadn't heard before. He shouted for his mates to join him in a meal until he walked through and noticed us. He claimed the camp as his, I had only just awoken. Caelith stepped before me, I wanted to reason with the newcomer, but now I've learned that raising my voice in attempt to stop the fighting that occurred, even after the bandit said that women were for sex. I was distraught, it was stupid of me to think I could control this, despite the fact the newcomer was much better at fighting than Caelith and Balia. They rest were sleeping, I'm surprised they didn't wake with all the commotion, perhaps there had been something in their meals, I only just managed to stay awake. In the end, I told the bandit that attacking us was futile, that we had nothing to give him, he left soon after. Caelith was in a bad way, a cut to his throat which Meepers stitched and bandaged. Balia was in a better state however... I probably deserved being hit over the head by Caelith. I would not have realized the seriousness of the situation otherwise. I have a bit of a bruise, I am not surprised, Caelith was furious. We'd all quietened down when Pres awakened. At that point I still hadn't understood what I had done and when Pres spotted the bruise, when I told him what Kay had done, he was furious. Too many tempers were rising, alongside our voices. I was fearful when Pres pointed his sword at Caelith's throat, though he was wise, he challenged Caelith to a duel. It's unbelievable how stressed I've been. Certain people can't be put in one place without an argument. Pres took me from the camp, just outside in the swamp, so we could talk. He didn't manage to get much out of me, I merely frustrated him. It amuses me now, as I'm sure it'll amuse him in time to come. I love how he takes care of me, I love how he takes care of me and bubs. I frustrated Pres more so when we went back into camp, I apologized for what I had done, and for needing to be hit to realize what I had done. Of course Pres wouldn't be happy at that, but apologies were accepted and I got an apology myself from Caelith for hitting me. I'm sure Pres still wishes to duel him though. Anyway, after Pres had walked off his anger we both eventually decided to rest, a good sleep might get if off our systems. It was off my system until the next morning..."<br/>

             "Day 8 - Jeudi, 12th of Grass:<br/><br/> It seems Pres took up my time and I have forgotten to write up my journal of the last day. We have ventured out into the swamp for the last time as soon as I had woken for the second time that day, tensions were still high and I was glad Caelith remained behind. Dame Grazia, Dame Valara, Meepers, Pres and I searched the grounds. The reason I was kept from writing for so long was because Pres had nibbled a magic mushroom, he was out cold for a good time after attempting to hack at some swamp vegetation. Meepers had been sick on Dame Grazia and this was the point where we headed back.<br/><br/> We had already packed up our belongings, therefore, we dragged Pres and a still puking Meepers onto the punt and headed out. I was glad to arrive back in the city, easier to avoid Caelith, but I had been especially looking forward to a bath and my new outfit. Hrm... Not much else to note that is important, other than the fact that it took a considerable amount of time trying to organize the search specimens. Anyway, enough of my rambling, it is done."<br/>
