             Chapter 1: Helmets
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             First craft a basic helmet to modify to these specialty helmets. Take great care in selection and style. All helmets have a defensive value, or INK SCORE, of 1. All helmets require three feet of metal to forge.<br/><br/> MORION: Grade 13<br/> An iron morion. A morion is a type of open helmet with a crest or comb at the top designed to strengthen it, with a rim circling the lower edge.<br/><br/> KETTLE HAT: Grade 13<br/> An iron kettle hat. It is a type of helmet made from metal in the shape of a hat. The only common element is a wide brim that afforded extra protection for the wearer. It was worn by troops of all types, but most commonly by infantry. The wide brim gave good protection against blows from above, such as from cavalry sabres, and were very useful in siege warfare as the wide brim would protect the wearer from projectiles shot or dropped from above.<br/><br/> CERVELLIERE: Grade 14<br/> A brass cervelliere. It is a round, close-fitting skull cap; this helmet was frequently worn beneath a great helm (heaume).<br/><br/> CAPELINE: Grade 15<br/> An iron capeline. It is also known as a lobster pot. The lobster-tailed pot had ear flaps, a visor that included a sliding nasal bar to protect the trooper from sword thrusts and an articulated 'tail' protecting the back of the head that was said to resemble a lobster.<br/><br/> HOUNSKULL: Grade 15<br/> An iron hounskull. The hounskull was a form of bascinet with a visor covering the entire face. It is the visor which gives the helmet its name, as this resembles the face of a dog ("hound" or, in Northern, "Hund"), with a protruding muzzle in order to better protect the face from blows and to grant greater ventilation (which was largely afforded the wearer, when the visor was down, through holes in the "muzzle", such holes being either on the right side of the "muzzle" with additional holes near the mouth, or on both sides).<br/><br/> SPANGENHELM: Grade 16<br/> An iron spangenhelm. The name is of Northern origin. Spangen refers to the metal straps that form the framework for the helmet and could be translated as clips, and -helm simply means helmet. The strips connect three to six plates (normally steel or bronze). The frame takes a conical design that curves with the shape of the head and culminates in a point. The front of the helmet includes a nose protector (a nasal) and cheek flaps made from leather.<br/><br/> BASCINET: Grade 17<br/> An iron bascinet. It is an open-faced, military helmet, typically fitted with a hinged visor and worn with a gorget. For comfort, there is a linen blend cloth stuffed with wool on this inside of the close-fitting helmet, and, though there is no chin strap, this helmet was often tied to a surcoat or armor to prevent it from being lifted off the wearer's head.<br/><br/> BARBUTE: Grade 18<br/> An iron barbute. Characterized by a rounded skull, a t-shaped opening for the face, a strongly flared tail, and cheek pieces, this helmet has been executed to form a very elegant, flowing defense for the head. It is layered on top with velvet cloth which has been covered with a latten floral adornment.<br/><br/> BURGONET: Grade 18<br/> An iron burgonet. This helm affords protection to the neck as well as the head and face. It boasts a fully articulated falling buffe that is secured by leather straps which can be adjusted to allow for better air flow and visibility. An impressive fin decorates the top, while the visor is adorned with simple cut-out crosses.<br/><br/> SALLET: Grade 18<br/> An iron sallet. Suitable for foot or mounted combat, this two-tiered helmet is constructed with a tail to protect the back of the head and neck. It sits flush on a bevor, which protects the chin and throat. Featuring a moveable visor which provides for good ventilation and visibility, and a bevor with falling buffe, it is forged of metal and fully lined.<br/><br/> (more to be added with later editions)<br/>

             TORSO ARMORS<br/><br/> These items protect various parts of the TORSO, including:<br/> Chest, Upper chest, Breastbone, stomach, waist, groin, top of shoulders, collarbones and neck. Again, Inkscore is its defense value on Incudines scale of protectiveness.<br/><br/> Lorica: Chest (2 feet of metal, Inkscore 1) Grade 2:<br/> A small breastplate that protects the sternum and the ribs and attaches around the neck.<br/><br/> Cuirass: Chest (6 feet of metal, Inkscore 4) Grade 4:<br/> A cuirass, is a piece of armour, formed of a single or multiple pieces of metal or other rigid material, which covers the front of the wearer's person. In a suit of armour this important piece was generally connected to a back piece and cuirass could refer to the complete torso-protecting armour.<br/><br/> Breastplate: Chest (4 feet of metal, Inkscore 3) Grade 8:<br/> A breastplate is a device worn over the torso to protect it from injury, as an item of religious significance, or as an item of status. A breastplate is sometimes worn by mythological beings as a distinctive item of clothing. The breastplate is the front portion of plate armour covering the torso.<br/><br/> Culet (lower back and butt, 4 feet of metal, Inkscore 3) Grade 8:<br/> A piece of plate armor consisting of small, horizontal lames that protect the small of the back or the buttocks.<br/><br/> Codpiece (Crotch, 1 foot of metal, inkscore 1) Grade 9:<br/> It is a flap or pouch that attaches to the front of the crotch of men's pants to provide covering for the genitals. It was held closed by string ties, buttons, or other methods.<br/><br/> Spaulders (Shoulders, 3 feet of metal, inkscore 2) Grade 13:<br/> A part of plate armor, they are armored plates forged to protect the upper arms and shoulders. As these do not cover the arm holes when worn with a cuirass, the gaps may be defended by besagews or simply left bare, exposing the mail beneath.<br/><br/> Pauldrons (Shoulders and Armpits 3 feet of metal, inkscore 3) Grade 15:<br/> Larger than spaulders, these are a component of plate armor made to cover the shoulders, armpits, and sometimes parts of the back and chest. Typically, pauldrons tend to consist of a single dome-shaped piece to cover the shoulder with multiple lames attached to defend the arm.<br/><br/> Chastity Belt (Crotch, 2 feet of metal, inkscore 2) Grade 17:<br/> A chastity belt is a locking item of clothing designed to prevent sexual intercourse. They may be used to protect the wearer from force or temptation. Some devices have been designed with additional features to prevent masturbation. Chastity belts have been created for males and females, ostensibly for the purpose of chastity.<br/>

The breastplate is the front portion of plate armour covering the torso.<br/><br/> Culet (lower back and butt, 4 feet of metal, Inkscore 3) Grade 8:<br/> A piece of plate armor consisting of small, horizontal lames that protect the small of the back or the buttocks.<br/><br/> Codpiece (Crotch, 1 foot of metal, inkscore 1) Grade 9:<br/> It is a flap or pouch that attaches to the front of the crotch of men's pants to provide covering for the genitals. It was held closed by string ties, buttons, or other methods.<br/><br/> Spaulders (Shoulders, 3 feet of metal, inkscore 2) Grade 13:<br/> A part of plate armor, they are armored plates forged to protect the upper arms and shoulders. As these do not cover the arm holes when worn with a cuirass, the gaps may be defended by besagews or simply left bare, exposing the mail beneath.<br/><br/> Pauldrons (Shoulders and Armpits 3 feet of metal, inkscore 3) Grade 15:<br/> Larger than spaulders, these are a component of plate armor made to cover the shoulders, armpits, and sometimes parts of the back and chest. Typically, pauldrons tend to consist of a single dome-shaped piece to cover the shoulder with multiple lames attached to defend the arm.<br/><br/> Chastity Belt (Crotch, 2 feet of metal, inkscore 2) Grade 17:<br/> A chastity belt is a locking item of clothing designed to prevent sexual intercourse. They may be used to protect the wearer from force or temptation. Some devices have been designed with additional features to prevent masturbation. Chastity belts have been created for males and females, ostensibly for the purpose of chastity.<br/>

             Additional Pieces:<br/><br/> These Pieces fit between other armors, fasten more important pieces together, cover gaps in armor, or attach to the limbs of a person. NOTE: One cannot wear something like besagews that protect the armpits and pauldrons at the same time. Pauldrons have something like besagews already built in, and wearing both is not physically possible.<br/><br/> Rondel: (misc places) 1 Foot of metal, Inkscore 1, Grade 1<br/> This is a circular piece of metal used for protection, as a harness of plate armor, or attached to a helmet, breastplate, couter, or on a gauntlet.<br/><br/> Bracers: (forearms and wrists) 2 foot, Inkscore 2, Grade 2<br/> They are plates wrapped around the wrists, usually worn by archers or fencers for protection.<br/><br/> Schynbalds: (Shins) 2 foot, Inkscore 1, Grade 3<br/> These are metal plates strapped over chausses, each schynbald is a single piece of metal that covers the front and outside of the shin. They do not enclose the lower leg: hence, they are not true greaves.<br/><br/> Greaves: (Shins and calves) 4 foot, Inkscore 2, Grade 6<br/> It wraps the front sides and calves of the lower legs for protection.<br/><br/> Besagews: (Armpit) 1 foot, Inkscore 1, Grade 7<br/> They are circular defenses used to protect the under arms, the armpits particularly, as part of a harness of plate armor.<br/><br/> Sabatons: (feet) 4 foot, Inkscore 2, Grade 10<br/> These are riveted plates that are worn upon the feet and protect them from damage while allowing movement and flexibility.<br/><br/> Couters: (Elbows) 1 foot, Inkscore 1, Grade 11<br/> They are a component in a piece of plate armor, they are used in defense of the elbows. They are forged into an articulate joint.<br/><br/> Polyens: (Knees) 2 foot, Inkscore 1, Grade 11<br/> Developed with an articulated construction, these are plates designed for protecting the knees. They can be attached to cuisses or greaves, as desired.<br/><br/> Gauntlets: (hands) 2 foot of metal, Inkscore 2, Grade 15<br/> They protect the backs of hands and the wrists, and are made of many smaller plates that allow flexibility of the fingers.<br/>
