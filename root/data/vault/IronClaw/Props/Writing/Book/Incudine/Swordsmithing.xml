A properly measured rapier blade should reach from the ground to bottom of the wielders ribs. The rapier blade can be quite unwieldy, and is of little use in close quarters.<br/><br/>Sabre - Fencing - Grade 18<br/>The fastest of cutting sword blades, the sabre is a wedge-shaped, curved blade. A footmans sabre is generally fairly straight, and a horsemans sabre is dramatically curved, so the wielder can keep hold of the weapon while striking at the gallop.<br/>

             Chapter 5 HILTS:<br/><br/>Choosing the right hilt for a sword is ESSENTIAL!<br/><br/>There are five main types of hilts with many variations and alterations. But the five basic types are:<br/><br/>Bar hilt: A simple cruciform device that serves to protect the wielders hand without getting in the way during fighting. This is an older style of guard, popular on large two-handed swords and antiques.<br/><br/>Crossguard: Also known as a knucklebow, a bar or strip protecting the front of the hand. Knucklebows are useful for swords that are often carried everyday, as the guard is flat and doesn't get in the way. For this reason, knucklebowed swords are also very fast to draw.<br/><br/>Bell: A development of the knucklebow. The strip protecting the hand is widened and curved around the wielders knuckles. This style of guard is popular on pirate cutlasses, and all other fencing weapons.<br/><br/>Basket Hilt: An intricate cage surrounds the hilt, protecting the wielder's hand. This is the hilt of choice for the Bisclavret and due to their close-fitting nature are best on cutting, rather than thrusting swords. <br/><br/>Swept hilt: I cant make these yet, but i'm sure they are very stylish. Wish i learn this schematic, i'll update this edition.<br/><br/>As you can see, putting a plain bar hilt on a cutlass or rapier, is an insult to the blade. A fencing basket hilt on a big two handed sword like a claymore is equally distasteful. Be mindful of what you choose.<br/>
