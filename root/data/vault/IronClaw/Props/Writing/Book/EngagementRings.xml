             Chapter Two<br/> The Diamond<br/> ---<br/> Cut<br/> The cut is the most important thing to consider. That is because it's what makes the gem sparkle. However shiny the diamond is all depends on the cut and the way light reflects off of it. Skilled professionals use exact proportions to cut the stone; if they are not careful, the diamond can easily lose its brilliance, even if the color and clarity of the diamond are perfect. For example, if the stone is cut too shallow, light escapes from the sides, but if the stone is cut too deep, light escapes from the bottom. The cut of a diamond is often thought to be the same as the shape of the diamond, but I assure you, it isn't. The cut affects the way light passes through the diamond, while the shape of the diamond is its physical shape. You know when you look at a diamond and you see all those different sides within the diamond and it's all sparkly? That's the cut of the diamond.<br/><br/> Shape: If the diamond is round, that's the shape. (Asscher Cut, Cushion Cut, Emerald Cut, Heart, Marquise, Oval, Pear, Princess Cut, Radiant, Round,.) The 4 most common diamond shapes are: Round (or brilliant), Emerald, Marquis and Pear.<br/><br/> Note: Pick brilliance over size. Remember that the cut facilitates the brilliance of the diamond. The more brilliance, the size of the diamond decreases. If the stone is cut for size, it will lose brilliance.<br/><br/> Color<br/><br/> All diamonds are almost always clear or white. The most transparent, clear, colorless diamonds are classified as D. Diamonds range from being classified as D to Z, as Z is still clear, but tainted with some color. They are graded by flipping over the diamond and viewing the stone upside down on a non-reflected white background. Even if the diamond is colorless from the top where everyone sees it, but tainted at the bottom, it is still classified as tainted. While typically the most popular diamonds are colorless, there are some diamonds that have color, which are not graded on the D to Z scale. Some diamonds are blue, pink, black, orange, purple, yellow, etc. The system that grades colored diamonds is called the "fancy colored diamond grading system." Original name for it, huh?

             Chapter Three<br/> Ring Settings/Band<br/> ---<br/> When it comes to searching for the right engagement ring, platinum and gold are the most popular. Platinum tends to be a favorite for many people because of its strength and durability. It also happens to be thirty-five times rarer than gold, so it could get a little pricey, but since this is an engagement ring, you might as well go all out, no? However, the negative part about platinum is that it tends to scratch easily, but it doesn't tarnish. Gold doesn't scratch as easily, but it sometimes changes color after many years, depending on the metals the ring was put together with. White gold is pretty popular for engagement rings too, but the problem with white or yellow gold is that it is not as strong as platinum and if it is white gold, the color tends to go back to being the original yellow, since white gold is man-made through plating.<br/><br/> Once you know what kind of ring you're looking for, keep in mind that besides the regular solitaire setting, there are also side stone settings and matching bands. Solitaire settings are rings with just the diamond in the center and side stone settings are the same as solitaire, but the sides of the ring are adorned by smaller diamonds. Matching bands are two rings that account for one engagement ring. While one ring holds the diamond(s), the other ring is simply a band that assists the main ring. There are so many types of rings that differ in size, weight, and carats; you want to be sure she'll like it and that it fits her.<br/><br/> Hint: Select white gold or platinum. Yes, these types of metals cost more, but it will enhance the white light reflecting from the top and clearness of the diamond stone.

             Chapter Four<br/> The Ideal Ring<br/> ---<br/> Deciding how much to spend on your lady's engagement ring is always a tricky decision. It should depend on your salary, but roughly speaking, it should be about two to five months salary. You can definitely spend over that, but the minimum amount you should pay should at least be two months salary.<br/><br/> After you figured out what kind of jewelry she likes, measure her fourth finger with a measuring tape or string so you get the exact measurement. To be a teensy more inconspicuous than that, you might want to “borrow” one of her rings for a day or two, take it to a jeweler, have them fit the engagement ring using her other ring and then place it back before she realizes something is missing.<br/><br/> The size of the ring remains totally up to you and what you think your girlfriend would like. As I mentioned before, if her hands are small and delicate, a smaller diamond might look nice on her finger, but you could always go with a bigger diamond if you wanted to. If she has large hands, a smaller diamond would probably make her hand look larger, so it is advised that you go with a bigger diamond.

             Chapter Five<br/> Ring Tips/Advice<br/> ---<br/> Ways to get her ring size without arousing suspicion from her, her friends, and family:<br/> Take one of her rings, and press it between 2 bars of soap. This allows for an impression to be brought to the jeweler. Another way is to outline the ring on a sheet of paper with a pencil/pen. Or you can take her ring and mark where it stops on your finger.<br/><br/> Hint: Budget savers, it is better to spend more money on the stone than it is on the band because when your fiance flashes her rock around, she's flashing the rock, not the band. Plus, you can always upgrade the band, but never the rock.<br/><br/> Be cautious when you buy the ring as a whole, because the whole ring can't be examined out of its setting. If you were the jeweler, wouldn't you conceal the defects/inclusions under the ring prong? Typically, a setting fee won't be charged if you purchase the stone and the band there.<br/><br/> Negotiating Hint: If you are still unsatisfied after the jeweler has made it obvious that they are not willing to lower the price any further; you can offer to pay by cash over a payment plan or promissory note. Be careful, should you stumble across any problems; it is usually futile settling disputes where cash was the only source of an unmarked transaction. It's a good idea to ask for a receipt.
