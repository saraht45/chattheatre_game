             The Transformed Comhach Seeks a Bridegroom
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             On the shores of the Meridionale Ocean, just outside Port Spar, there was a hermitage filled with holy men dedicated to prayer, self denial, repentance, the study of holy scriptures, fasting, and meditation. They drank only small amounts of very pure water, and mortified their bodies with a diet of bulbs, roots, fruits, and water plants. Their only clothing were loincloths made from tree bark.<br/><br/>The father of the hermitage was named Ungar. He had just finished bathing in a freshwater tide pool, courtesy of recent and plentiful rains, and was about to rinse out his mouth when a little comhach fell from a falcon's beak into his hand. After looking at it, he set it onto a fig leaf, bathed himself once more, rinsed out his mouth, and performed his penitential and other rituals. Then through the power of his holiness he transformed the comhach into a girl.<br/><br/>Taking her home with him to his hermitage, he said to his wife, who was childless, "My dear, take her in place of a daughter. Bring her up with care!"<br/><br/>Thereafter she was reared, loved, and nurtured. When she was twelve years old, and the wife saw that she was ready for marriage, she said to her husband, "Listen, husband, do you not see that it is past time for our daughter's marriage?"<br/><br/>He said, "What you say is quite right! So if she is willing, I will summon the exalted sun god and present her to him as a wife.<br/><br/>His wife said, "What could be said against that? Do it!"<br/><br/> Through the power of prayer and incantations the sun appeared without delay, saying, "Holy man, why do you summon me?"<br/><br/>The man answered, "Behold! Here stands my little daughter. If she will have you, take her as a wife!"<br/><br/>Having said this, he said to his daughter, "Daughter, does this exalted one please you, this sun god who illuminates all the world?"<br/><br/>The daughter said, "Father, he is too hot. I do not want him. Summon a better one!"<br/><br/>Hearing this, the wise man said to the sun, "Exalted one, is there a being more powerful than you?"<br/><br/>The sun answered, "Yes, there is a stronger one than I. The cloud, through whose cover I become invisible."<br/><br/>Then the wise man summoned the cloud and said to his daughter, "Daughter, shall I give you to this one as a wife?"<br/><br/>She answered, "He is black and cold. Therefore give me to another powerful being!"<br/><br/>Upon this the wise man asked the cloud, "Listen, cloud! Is there anyone more powerful than you?"<br/><br/>The cloud answered, "The wind is more powerful than I! Driven by the wind, I am scattered into a thousand pieces."<br/><br/>After hearing this, the wise man summoned the wind and said, "Daughter, does the wind please you most of all as a husband?"<br/><br/>She answered, "Father! He is entirely too inconstant. Summon a more powerful one instead!"<br/><br/>The wise man said, "Wind, is there anyone more powerful than you?"<br/><br/>The wind said, "The mountain is more powerful than I, for however strong I am, he still stands firmly against me."<br/><br/>Then the wise man summoned the mountain and said to the girl, "Daughter, shall I give you to this one in marriage?"<br/><br/>She answered, "Father, he is hard and rigid. Therefore give me to another one."<br/><br/>The wise man asked the mountain, "Listen, king of the mountains, is there anyone more powerful than you?"<br/><br/>The mountain answered, "The comhach are more powerful than I, for they make holes in my body with violence."<br/><br/>With that the wise man summoned a comhach and showed him to her, saying, "Daughter, shall I give you to him as a wife? Does this comhach king please you?"<br/><br/>Seeing him, she thought, "He is of my own kind."<br/><br/>Her hair stood on end with pleasure, making her even more beautiful, and she said, "Father, make me into a comhach and give me to him as a wife so I can fulfill the domestic duties prescribed for my kind!"<br/><br/>Through the power of his holiness he transformed her into a little comhach and gave her to the other comhach as a wife.

"Can't you remember about three months ago when we broke down, and those two guys helped us?<br/><br/>I think you should help him, and you should be ashamed of yourself! "S'allumer loves drunk people too you know."<br/><br/>The man does as he is told, gets dressed, and goes out into the pounding rain.<br/><br/>He calls out into the dark, "Hello, are you still there?"<br/><br/>"Yes," comes back the answer.<br/><br/>"Do you still need a push?" calls out the husband.<br/><br/>"Yes, please!" comes the reply from the dark.<br/><br/>"Where are you?" asks the husband.<br/><br/>"Over here... on the swing," replied the drunk.

             A wolf and his wife were awakened in the middle of the night by a loud pounding on their door.<br/><br/>The man gets up and opens it, where a drunken stranger, standing in the pouring rain, is asking for a push.<br/><br/>"Not a chance," says the husband, "it's the middle of the night!"<br/><br/>He slams the door and returns to bed.<br/><br/>"Who was that?" asked his wife... "Just some drunk guy asking for help to push his wagon through the mud," he incorrectly assumes.<br/><br/>"Did you help him?" she asks.<br/><br/>"No, I did not, it's the middle of the night and it's bloomin' well pouring with rain out there!"<br/><br/>"Well, you have a short memory," says his wife. "Can't you remember about three months ago when we broke down, and those two guys helped us?<br/><br/>I think you should help him, and you should be ashamed of yourself! "S'allumer loves drunk people too you know."<br/><br/>The man does as he is told, gets dressed, and goes out into the pounding rain.<br/><br/>He calls out into the dark, "Hello, are you still there?"<br/><br/>"Yes," comes back the answer.<br/><br/>"Do you still need a push?" calls out the husband.<br/><br/>"Yes, please!" comes the reply from the dark.<br/><br/>"Where are you?" asks the husband.<br/><br/>"Over here... on the swing," replied the drunk.

He accordingly went back, and began twisting up a torch, when all at once in she came, and snatching the torch out of his hand, threw it away, saying, "You're a bad fellow, and I don't like you, and I shan't have any more to do with you."

This Gerti explained, saying, "When I was a flower-nymph I had a body; but now I am only the disembodied spirit of that flower. Do not regard me as a reality, but rather as an apparition seen in a dream."

             "You have come at the nick of time," cried Gerti; "your husband there was just getting troublesome." Briggita now instructed Breckert to take a little powdered white-berry, and mixing it with some sulphur, to pour out a libation to her, adding, "This day next year I will return your kindness."<br/><br/>The young ladies then went away, and next day Breckert observed the shoots of a young peony growing up where Briggita had once stood. So he made the libation as she had told him, and had the plant very carefully tended, even building a fence all round to protect it. Briggita came to thank him for this, and he proposed that the plant should be removed to his own home; but to this she would not agree, "for," said she, "I am not very strong, and could not stand being transplanted. Besides, all things have their appointed place; and as I was not originally intended for your home, it might shorten my life to be sent there. We can love each other very well here." Breckert then asked why Gerti did not come; to which Briggita replied that they must make her, and proceeded with him into the garden, where, after picking a blade of grass, she measured upwards from the roots of Gerti's plant to a distance of four feet six inches, at which point she stopped, and Breckert began to scratch a mark on the place with his nails.

In the twinkling of an eye she had jumped out, and lo! it was Briggita. "Through the wind and the rain I have waited for you," cried she; "why have you come so late?" They then went into the house, where they found Gerti already arrived, and sat down to enjoy themselves as they had done in former times.
