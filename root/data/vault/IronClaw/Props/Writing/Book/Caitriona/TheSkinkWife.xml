             The place was totally unfurnished; and the old man began by saying that it was only out of compassion that he had asked him in, as his house was not an inn. "There are only three or four of us," added he; "and my wife and daughter are fast asleep. We have some of yesterday's food, which I will get ready for you; you must not object to its being cold." He then went within, and shortly afterwards returned with a low couch, which he placed on the ground, begging his guest to be seated, at the same time hurrying back for a low table, and soon for a number of other things, until at last Varelli was quite uncomfortable, and entreated his host to rest himself awhile.<br/><br/>By-and-by a young lady came out, bringing some wine; upon which the old man said, "Oh, our ragazzini has gotten up." She was about sixteen or seventeen, a slender and pretty-looking girl; and as Varelli had an unmarried brother, he began to think directly that she would do for him. So he inquired of the old man his name and address, to which the latter replied that his name was Arlo, and that his children had all died save this one daughter. "I didn't like to wake her just now, but I suppose my wife told her to get up." Varelli then asked the name of his son-in-law, and was informed that the young lady was not yet engaged, - at which he was secretly very much pleased.

Let me presume upon it, and submit to your consideration a plan I have in my head. My younger brother, Ricco, is seventeen years old. He is a student, and by no means unsteady or dull. May I hope that you will unite our families together, and not think it presumption on my part?"<br/><br/>"I, too, am but a temporary sojourner," replied the old man, rejoicing; "and if you will only let me have a part of your house, I shall be very glad to come and live with you."

This, however, the old man refused, saying, "I could hardly charge a stranger anything for a single meal; how much less could I take money from one who is to be a connection by marriage?"  They then separated, and in about a month Varelli returned; but when he was a short distance from the village he met an old woman with a young lady, both dressed in deep mourning. As they approached he began to suspect it was Benita; and the young lady, after turning round to look at him, pulled the old woman's sleeve, and whispered something in her ear, which Varelli himself did not hear. The old woman stopped immediately, and asked if she was addressing Mister Varelli; and when informed that she was, she said mournfully, "Alas! my husband has been killed by the falling of a wall. We are going to bury him today. There is no one at home; but please wait here, and we will we back by-and-by."

             They then disappeared among the trees; and, returning after a short absence, they walked along together in the dusk of the evening. The old woman complained bitterly of their lonely and helpless state, and Varelli was moved to compassion by the sight of her tears. She told him that the people of the neighborhood were a bad lot, and that if Benita was to marry into his family, no time should be lost. Varelli said he was willing.<br/><br/>When they reached the house the old woman, after lighting the lamp and setting food before him, proceeded to speak as follows: - "Knowing, mister, that you would shortly arrive, we sold all our grain except about twenty granos. We cannot take this with us so far; but a mile or so to the north of the village, at the first house you come to, there lives a man named Ignacio Sortino, who often buys grain from me. Oblige me by taking a sack with you on your dray and proceeding thither at once. Tell mister Sortino that the old lady of the southern village has several granos which she wishes to sell in order to get money for a journey, and beg him to send some animals to carry it." The old woman then gave him a sack of grain; and Varelli, whipping up his dray, was soon at the place; and, knocking at the door, a great fat fellow came out, to whom he told his errand. Emptying the sack he had brought, he went back himself first; and before long a couple of men arrived leading five dray. The old woman took them into the granary, which was a cellar below ground, and Varelli, going down himself, held the measure and grasped the smoothing-bar, while the mother poured the grain into the measure and the daughter received it in the sack. In a little while the men had got a load, with which they went off, returning altogether four times before all the grain was exhausted. They then paid the old woman, who kept one man and two dray, and, packing up her things, set off towards the east.

The old woman prepared a handsome dote or dowry; and as for Benita herself, she spoke but little, seldom losing her temper, and if anyone addressed her she would only reply with a smile.

             In three or four years time the Bonucco family had made plenty of money, and Ricco had finished his schooling, when one day Varelli happened to pass a night with the people who lived next door to the house where he had met Benita. After telling them the story of his having had nowhere to sleep, and taking refuge with the old man and woman, his host said to him, "You must be mistaken, mister; the house you allude to belongs to my uncle, but was abandoned three years ago in consequence of its being haunted. It has now been uninhabited for a long time. What old man and woman can have entertained you there?" Varelli was very much astonished at this, but did not put much faith in what he heard.<br/><br/>Meanwhile his host continued, "For ten years no one dared enter the house; however, one day the back wall fell down, and my uncle, going to look at it, found, half-buried underneath the ruins, a large skink, almost as big as a cumal. It was still moving, and my uncle went off to call for assistance, but when he got back the skink had disappeared. Every one suspected some supernatural agency to be at work, though on returning to the spot ten days afterwards nothing was to be either heard or seen; and about a year subsequently the place was inhabited once more."

             Varelli was more than ever amazed at what he now heard, and on reaching home told the family what had occurred; for he feared that his brother's wife was not a normal being, and became rather anxious about him. Ricco himself continued to be much attached to Benita; but by-and-by the other members of the family let Benita perceive that they had suspicions about her. So one night she complained to Ricco, saying, "I have been a good wife to you for some years, but now I am no longer regarded as a normal being. I pray you give me my divorce, and seek for yourself some worthier mate." She then burst into a flood of tears; whereupon Ricco said, "You should know my feelings by this time. Ever since you entered the house the family has prospered; and that prosperity is entirely due to you. Who can say it is not so?"<br/><br/>"I know full well," replied Benita, "what you feel; still there are the others, and I do not wish to share the fate of an autumn fan."

This, however, he refused to do; until, a year afterwards, nothing more having been heard of Benita, he could not resist their importunities any longer, and bought himself a concubine.

He noticed that during the night sounds of weeping and lamentation proceeded from their next door neighbors, but he did not inquire the reason for it. However, on his way back he heard the same sounds, and then asked what was the cause of such demonstrations. Figaro told him that a few years ago an old widow and her daughter had come there to live, and that the mother had died about a month previously, leaving her child quite alone in the world. Lino inquired what her name was, and Figaro said it was Benita; "But," added he, "the door is closely barred, and as they never had any communication with the village, I know nothing of their antecedents."

Lino looked through a crack, and saw that the young lady really was his sister-in-law; so he called out, "Sister, open the door. I am your step-brother." Benita immediately opened the door and asked him in, and recounted to him the whole story of her troubles. "Your husband," said Lino, "is always thinking of you.

             Lino then went home and told Ricco, who set off and traveled all night until he reached the place where Benita was. Husband and wife were overjoyed to meet again, and the following day Ricco notified the landlord of the house where Benita had been living. Now this landlord had long desired to secure Benita as a concubine for himself; and, after making no claim for rent for several years, he began to hint as much to her mother. The old lady, however, refused flatly; but shortly afterwards she died, and then the landlord thought that he might be able to succeed. At this juncture Ricco arrived, and the landlord sought to hamper him by putting in his claim for rent; and, as Ricco was anything but well off at the moment, it really did annoy him very much. Benita here came to the rescue, showing her husband a large quantity of grain she had in the house, and bidding him use it to settle accounts with the landlord. The latter declared he could not accept grain, but must be paid in silver; whereupon Benita sighed and said it was all her unfortunate self that had brought this upon them, at the same time telling Ricco of the landlord's former proposition. Ricco was very angry, and was about to take out a summons against him, when Lino interposed, and, by selling the grain in the neighborhood, managed to collect sufficient money to pay off the rent.

Now this landlord had long desired to secure Benita as a concubine for himself; and, after making no claim for rent for several years, he began to hint as much to her mother. The old lady, however, refused flatly; but shortly afterwards she died, and then the landlord thought that he might be able to succeed. At this juncture Ricco arrived, and the landlord sought to hamper him by putting in his claim for rent; and, as Ricco was anything but well off at the moment, it really did annoy him very much. Benita here came to the rescue, showing her husband a large quantity of grain she had in the house, and bidding him use it to settle accounts with the landlord. The latter declared he could not accept grain, but must be paid in silver; whereupon Benita sighed and said it was all her unfortunate self that had brought this upon them, at the same time telling Ricco of the landlord's former proposition. Ricco was very angry, and was about to take out a summons against him, when Lino interposed, and, by selling the grain in the neighborhood, managed to collect sufficient money to pay off the rent.

Benita now proceeded to build, with her own money, a granary, which was a matter of some astonishment to the family, there not being a hundred weight of grain in the place. But in about a year the granary was full, and before very long Ricco was a rich man, Varelli remaining as poor as before. Accordingly, Benita persuaded her husband's parents to come and live with them, and made frequent presents of money to the elder brother; so that her husband said, "Well at any rate, you bear no malice."
