             Stories have come down from the generations of heroic efforts to save the mother's life by performing a cesearan operation to remove a stuck or still-born infant, but none of these can be confirmed. The recorded operations, and thus the ones that could be confirmed, were only as a last resort to, as stated before, save the infant from a dead mother or seperate the two for burial. There have, however, been a few confirmable records of operations that ended  with a live mother and a live infant, but in these cases, she lived only because of her strength and faith in the Light's blessing.<br/><br/> One such case is that of the Lady Adeline d'Avoirdupois, who in 747 Apres le Miracle, after several days of labour and help from ten midwives, was unable to deliver the children within her. Desperate, her doctor performed a cesearan operation, and the dear Lady gave birth via cesaeran operation twin boys. The names of these infants are not recorded and so unknown, but the fair Lady did continue on until her death in  763 Apres le Miracle, giving birth naturally to six other children, including the famous war lord and knight, Sir Michel d'Avoirdupois, who did lead the armies of the House to protect their lands against the oncoming Doloreaux.

             Many of the early cesarean operations took place in remote areas where medical aid and facilities were lacking.  In the absence of such medical professionals, these operations were carried out without consultation with a doctor, often upon a kitchen table or bed. These operations were, because of lack of medical consultation, sometimes carried out earlier in the failed labour when the mother was not near death and the infant not yet terribly distressed, and so success may have been more common in the country, away from hospitals where disease often spread between patients and infections were common because of the unwashed hands of medical attendants. These factors may help to explain such successes as Jacob Nufer's.

             Nufer was born in 782 and by fact of his work in animal husbandry, also had a knowledge of anatomy.  Before performing any operation, he sought to understand the organs and tissues involved, something rarely done during his time. He was at the prime of his career in 805, during which time he wrote several books with detailed illustrations of anatomy.  Others soon followed in his footsteps, and many such books were made available over the next decade. These books were, of course, only available to men.
