             Well a Bisclavret clad in kilt left the bar one evening fair.<br/> And one could tell by how he walked he'd drunk more than his share.<br/> He fumbled 'round until he could no longer keep his feet.<br/> Then stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street.<br/><br/> Ring-ding-diddle-diddle-i-de-o.<br/> Ring-di-diddle-i-o.<br/> He stumbled off into the grass to sleep beside the street.<br/><br/> 'Bout that time two young and lovely girls just happened by.<br/> And one says to the other with a twinkle in her eye.<br/> You see yon sleeping Bisclavret so strong and handsome built.<br/> I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath their kilt.<br/><br/> Ring-ding-diddle-diddle-i-de-o.<br/> Ring-di-diddle-i-o.<br/> I wonder if it's true what they don't wear beneath their kilt.<br/><br/> They crept up on that sleeping Bisclavret quiet as could be.<br/> Then lifted up his kilt about an inch so they could see.<br/> And there behold for them to view beneath his wolfish skirt.<br/> Was nothing more than S'Allumer had graced him with upon his birth.<br/><br/> Ring-ding-diddle-diddle-i-de-o.<br/> Ring-di-diddle-i-o.<br/> There was nothing more than S'Allumer gave upon his birth.<br/><br/> They marveled for a moment then one said we'd best be gone.<br/> But let's leave a present for our friend before we move along.<br/> As a gift they a blue silk ribbon tied it in a bow.<br/> Around the bonnie spar that the wolf's lifted kilt did show<br/><br/> Ring-ding-diddle-diddle-i-de-o.<br/> Ring-di-diddle-i-o.<br/> Around the bonnie spar that the wolf's lifted kilt did show<br/><br/> The Biscalvret woke to nature's call and stumbled toward a tree.<br/> Behind a bush he lifts his kilt and gawks at what he sees.<br/> Then in a startled voice he says to what's before his eyes.<br/> He said, "Lad I don't know where you've been but I see you won first prize"<br/><br/> Ring-ding-diddle-diddle-i-de-o.<br/> Ring-di-diddle-i-o.<br/> He said, "Lad I don't know where you've been but I see you won first prize"<br/>
