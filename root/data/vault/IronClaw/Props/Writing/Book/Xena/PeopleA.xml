             a desription of Abel
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             Abel:<br/><br/> He is a slim lithe fox, with short, smooth reddish brown fur, and shoulder-length golden blonde hair. He has forest green eyes, a fairly small nose and a thin mouth. A guard and Yeoman within House Doloreaux, he prides himself on his combat skills and his sense of humor, which only exists through his creation of jokes at the expense of others. He can most commonly be seen in the vicinity of Mister Caelith, another Doloreaux Guard. The two generally laze about searching for unsuspecting victims to harass when they aren't pretending to be busy with scrolls. As far as this informant can tell, Mister Abel has no romantic interest in any specific individual; rather, he enjoys being touchy and physical with anyone who will allow it.<br/>Update: 4th day of Frost.<br/>I went to the park to paint and wandered in on mister Gerard, mister Abel, and miss Nuit. I went to chat with Gerard about some things occurring in House Avoirdupois, as I needed some advice, and upon returning did hear mister Abel confess to miss Nuit that he 'loves' her. Just after, he kissed her lengthily on the lips. I confess to being disgusted, and so I dismissed myself, wondering about the situation entirely.<br/>Update: 10th day of Frost.<br/> I was near the waterfall sending out scrolls when miss Nuit arrived with mister Toby, supposedly her husband. They were fawning over each other, kissing, cuddling (all the normal inappropriate things she partakes in in public), and she then told him how much she loves him and how she could never be disloyal. This informant queried her vaguely about the park and with what appeared to be a sense of understanding and slight fear in her eyes, she simply said 'My friends.' This informant deducts she is a whore when her husband is away, but we will profile her behavior on her own page. Point? Mister Abel appears to be involved in some sort of love triangle.<br/><br/> Update 8.9.890 - Mister Abel now appears to be in some sort of relationship with a blacksmith named Liala. There was some gossip the other day that he broke down in the middle of the commons, pulling out a gun and a sword before finally falling to his knees and stammering that he just couldn't handle it. Magically Liala arrived to whisk him away, or so the story goes. I have yet to see him do any actual housework and so do wonder if he is still a part of the Doloreaux or not. I would seek someone out to confirm, but the Doloreaux are scarce these days and so will have to wait until I run into somebody.

             Viscountess Aedina:<br/><br/> I have yet to meet her in person, so I have no physical description to share. She is a Viscountess in the House Bisclavret and possesses lands in the territory of Quiarin. It is said she has a fondness for the harp and a deep-seated love for the arts.

Updates will be added as more information is uncovered.<br/>Update: 9th of Frost.<br/>The Viscountess attends the fashion show, escorted by Gentleman Mathias. She engages in conversation with miss Aeryn Brooks (though said discourse seemed forced rather than natural). The Lady does not appear to have any interest in clothing, finery, and even declined wine (possibly she doesn't care for alcoholic beverages). She seemed slightly aloof and eventually dismissed herself saying she was going for a walk.<br/><br/> Update 8.10.890 - A mister Rowf returned to town some time ago and coincidentally so did the Viscountess. People say they spent the majority of their waking time together, but I never saw them personally in one another's company. Both, at any rate, seem to have left again at the same time, so it does lead to assumptions about their relationship. As for Gentleman Mathias, he is now engaged to miss Brooks of the Avoirdupois.

             Aeryn:<br/><br/> Aeryn is a tall svelte palfrey, with a sleek black coat, and long honey blonde hair. She has bright blue eyes, a fine nose and a large mouth, though you'll find out what that means on your own. A gentry woman in the House Avoirdupois, she prides herself on her 'fashion sense' and her ability to charm men. She has no residence here in Triskellion, rather she has taken over the room of her brother and he has assumed the responsibility of caring for her in her oh-so-genteel state. She publicly expresses no interest in politics, but is eager behind the scenes to gain control of power however she is able. This informant suspects it is her goal to woo a man of Nobility to claim a title and lands to further herself and cement her position within the House. More will be added as information is uncovered.<br/>Update: 9th of Frost.<br/>After my own brief stint leading the members of House Avoirdupois, miss Brooks did decide she should take over being the 'figure-head' of the House. Despite protests from the few remaining members, she is bent on gaining leadership in the absence of proper Nobility. With my own promotion given up with my resignation, I'm sure it will only be a matter of time before she becomes an actual Noble through self-promotion. I have simply deduced that she is an unreasonable woman, stuck in an illusion that she is better than the rest of the world, Noble or otherwise. While she does mind herself somewhat in the presence of current Nobility, it is her greatest aspiration to prove that the Avoirdupois are better than all others, their supremacy unmatched. On a more amusing note, I tricked miss Brooks into wearing pants and a bodice for the fashion show, which she was most displeased about. Apparently it is inappropriate for women to don garments other than gowns or frilly foo-foos, especially if they are of noble birth. She has decided I'm a naer-do-well because of this, though really the only other available clothing was a dressing robe or men's outfit. I'd say she got the better end of the deal.<br/><br/> Update 8.9.890 - Miss Brooks is now engaged to wed Gentleman Mathias. After a brief stint in leadership, she was ousted by her other house members, being forced to resign. She now claims her title to be 'Curator of the Arts' and is working on the construction of an art museum, like so many before her have claimed to be doing. I haven't seen her face to face since my departure from the embassy, but I'm not complaining.

Depressingly enough, quite a few of these times were in the presence of mister Gerard, which made things slightly awkward. I suspect she is aware of some hidden story, but was kind enough not to probe, which I'm grateful for.

I agree to do so, but wonder how eager she will be, if such occurs, to take on a former spy from another House. I'm beginning to believe it was a very good thing entrusting information previously to Lord Marcus when it concerned the Rinaldi. Perhaps this will gain me the favor I need to gain a position where my skills are properly used.<br/><br/> Update 8.10.890 - Baroness Antonia has left the city. I did some work for her during her time here and was adequately compensated with a promotion for my efforts by Sir Matteo. In case she returns, I did find out some of her preferences. Her favorite tea is pu-erh, her favorite color is azure, she prefers white gold metals with blue stones, and she adores champagne and nearly any variety of wine. I confess that I miss her ability to delegate tasks to me. For a time I double-spyed, getting information on her for Master Zeiss and getting information on him for her. The trick? She knew about it and he didn't.

             "Prelate Adriana:<br/><br/>Prelate Adriana is a dainty compact panda, with short, fuzzy black-and-white fur, bright fern green eyes, and long bountiful midnight black hair. She is one of the higher ranking clergy within the Church of S'allumer being comparable socially to a Dame. She originally started out as a trader for the Rinaldi Trade Union, but for some reason decided to join the Church (perhaps a random calling?). She is now known as one of the more lenient clergy members, practicing, much like the Bishop, understanding, compassion, and forgiveness. Some time in the past it is rumored that she was killed by mister Khagra, formerly of the Rinaldi, at the behest of the now Presbyter Ximen. She suffered severe memory loss from the death and returned to town for only a short time before taking to hiding outside the city. She has since returned and performs the majority of ritual ceremonies on behalf of the Church. She has no known romantic interests, but does spend a lot of time around Sir Matteo.

She is a member of the Bisclavret House and Handmaiden to Viscountess Kenina, though she states she works for all the Ladies of the House (quite the undertaking). I've never witnessed her do any work, per se, and am not personally fond of her. She strikes me as a twit who got lucky when it came to job placement and nothing more. She is currently romantically interested in Tsubasa of the Rinaldi House. Her mother's name is Madalina, a pirate working under the supervision of Rhea. I will divulge that her mother is more a whore than a pirate, accepting a single gold piece to sleep with a filthy man and both thinking and professing it was a good deal. At any rate, miss Ammy trains regularly in combat and was recently attacked by a mister Chulainn bare-fisted. The reason for the attack is unknown, but Ammy was disinclined to press charges. You can easily spot her if you look for a tattered red cloak. I'm not sure why her House lets her wear a ruined symbol but she frequently points out how much she loves that specific garment.
