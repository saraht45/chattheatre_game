I don't believe he holds any affiliations with guilds or houses, but rather spends all his time hunting the vermin of the city. He rarely seems to speak, his only word to me being that of his name after I first offered my own introduction.

Sir Bayard and Sir Gregory afterward fought for control of the guard only to both leave the city for periods of time when neither turned up victorious. The public seems to consider Sir Bayard respectable, though the word 'hard-ass' has come up on a few occasions. It was noted by some that during a formal tournament he got angry about a ruling and simply walked out. More information will be shared as it is received."<br/><br/> Update 8.10.890 - Sir Bayard has recently returned to town and finally I have a general description. He is a huge rock-hard percheron with watery jet-black eyes, a short blue roan coat, and neat white hair. Many seemed elated to be in his presence, but to me, he lent an air of indifference to the atmosphere. I was arguing with one of his minions, Captain Brenner, when he passed through the lounge. He stopped, listened, and commented to the Captain how it was good to see him, but made no effort to interject on the dispute that was occurring. It was quite amusing to watch a Noble just passively stand there while his Captain and I exchanged verbal blows. And there is where he stood, silent, even after I took my leave. Now that he is a fixture again in the city I will see what else I can find out about him.

             a description of Brenner
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             "Brenner:<br/><br/> Brenner is a titanic broad-shouldered mustang, with an overo, smooth chestnut coat, and long coal black hair. He has bright cerulean blue eyes, a sharp nose, and a firm mouth. A member of House Avoirdupois, he currently holds the position of guard, though aspires to lead the section himself in the future. He is attentive when present, but terrible at responding to scrolls or organizing events. This informant believes he has taken an interest in Miss Noe Raisa of House Avoirdupois, but has not been nosy enough to have the speculation confirmed or denied. More information will be added as it is uncovered."<br/><br/> Update 8.10.890 - Mister Brenner did indeed have an interest in miss Raisa and the two are currently courting, possibly engaged. After my departure from House Avoirdupois, I was fortunate enough to see the now-ranked Captain's harsher side. A member of Docktown came to me in fear saying that the Captain was loitering around the commons on a daily basis and that he had tried to pull rank on everyone wearing masks, chiding them for their behavior. I have come to the realization that the Avoirdupois are set in their ways, and understand why people might fear individuals walking about in masks, but did not understand the need for name-slinging that the Captain followingly engaged in with the local merchant. The individual who came to me said that to protect his honor he had challenged the Captain to a duel and the Captain declined saying the merchant was 'beneath him'. Commoners are commoners, even commoners in houses, so I was disappointed that the Captain was using his 'rank' to avoid a properly-given challenge. I went to the public boards and posted a note outlining what people can expect in Docktown and what they cannot expect. I intentionally omitted names to protect both the merchant who gave me the information, and Captain Brenner. The day afterward I was pulled into the seamstress shop where the Captain chided me for openly chastizing him. I assured him it was only my intention that people know how Docktown is and that he understand why what he did was inappropriate. I would have been more than willing to go directly to him if I thought he would be reasonable, and he proved at that moment that he is not. He simply dismissed me with the comment 'I can't wait until Lord Edmond marries Lady Theressa so I can watch your heart break. You were never good enough for him anyway.'<br/> That might have struck a chord because for awhile I was bound and determined to hurt him for those words. I eventually spoke to Noelane and shared with her some information, but told her there would be no more from me if I didn't receive an apology from the Captain. No apology came. I had a chance meeting with Baroness Faye who apologized on his behalf, and while I appreciated it, I told her that it wasn't her place to make ammends for his harshness. A few days later, Captain Brenner was passing through the Newtown courier area and stopped. I was chatting with Fyros at the time and it seemed Brenner was interested in our conversation. After a few moments he began scanning the nearby buildings, as if he thought I had an assassin lurking somewhere to get rid of him. I amusedly assured him I had no desire to kill anybody and that even if I did, I wouldn't hurt him because he didn't hurt me physically. I told him I thought our feud was silly as we both acted as we believed was right, and that we needed to move on. He followingly commented that he has no idea why he ever trusts me, but ... and showed me a plan for a restaurant in the works. He said he wanted my advice on it, but I had to depart shortly afterward. I did ask him to scroll me with whatever aid he was requiring.

             "Breeze:<br/><br/>"Breeze is a tiny toned fuzzy lop, with long, fuzzy strawberry blonde fur, and long cerise streaked pale blonde hair. She has large brown eyes and a tattoo of a butterfly on her right ear. She currently serves as a deputy in the Constabulary, though hasn't been seen for nearing a month. It is believed she has a romantic relationship with Doctor Jahren, but I have been unable to confirm thus far.

             "Brie:<br/><br/>"Brie is a slim delicate mink, with short, sleek black fur, narrow lavender eyes, and long flouncy rich vanilla hair. She is the primary dye mixer for the seamstressing guild Rainbow Rags and a lead seamstress. I don't know much about her aside from the fact her speech patterns seem to reflect those of her boss, Cincin. She's good about making deals with people and excels at mathematics; her bill outlines being more complicated than mine by far. She has no known romantic interests, but you'd never be able to tell as single people are rarely as happy as she makes herself out to be. There have been a few occasions where I simply left the area, unable to handle her exceedingly cheerful disposition. That said, her stitching rivals that of Mistress Meepers, and so one does have to choose which to do business with.

             "Brutos:<br/><br/>"Brutos is a towering rock-hard bullmastiff, with short, scraggly dark brown fur, beady amaranth eyes, and shoulder-length wavy coal black hair. He has neatly-trimmed sideburns, and at least three tattoos. One on his left forearm, one on his right, and one on his chest of a bear claw. He is currently employed by Clover as a bodyguard. His pluralized speech does, at times, make him sound dim-witted, but he's actually quite intelligent, and certainly a formidable opponent in the arena. I courted him for a short time before deciding that we are just too different to be romantically involved, but he wears a locket of trust I gifted him around his neck still. He followingly courted Marea, not even observing the proper month's time of waiting between relationships. She cheated on him with a female, though I dont know precisely who, and they split it off. He is currently courting miss Hush who claims to be madly in love with. Regardless of his cluelessness in relationships he is a good person to have as an ally and someone that can be easily trusted.
