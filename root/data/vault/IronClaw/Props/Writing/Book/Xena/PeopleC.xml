A guard for House Doloreaux, his exact rank is unknown. It is said he has served in almost every embassy, only to betray each one time and time again. His lust for women is quite evident, especially if you are a woman. He spends his time flirting, trying to woo (quite successfully in a lot of cases), and philosophizing on life and love. He has a knack for finding out information through casual conversation, much like myself. He can be very nosy around people he can't figure out, assuming if roundabout ways of gathering information on them doesn't work, a direct route will. He currently has romantic interests in myself, miss Liza, and Doctor Grace; beyond that, I'm uncertain. More information will be added as it is uncovered."<br/><br/> Update 8.10.890 - Caelith is still his usual self, and unsurprisingly his interest in women have changed. He currently spends most of his time lurking around miss Leigh and chiding her for her choices in friends. To my knowledge he isn't affiliated with any of the Houses any longer, but rather just wanders about looking for a random spar to show off the only skill he has: combat strength. The aforementioned miss Liza left the city some time ago, as did Doctor Grace; as for myself, Sir Edmond finally stepped in with Caelith and suggested he stop stalking me or face some serious issues. It seems that it worked, as he won't even speak to me any longer."

             a description of Chinco
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             "Chinco:<br/><br/>Chinco is a large rugged wolf, with long, sleek brown fur, and light black hair. He has smooth sideburns, silver eyes, and a sharp nose. Once a member of the Black, Chinco has served in almost every embassy and been kicked out or deserted them due to his beliefs and/or actions. Fairly quiet most days, he spends his time in the west commons or down by the docks and apple trees, lazing about when he isn't picking fights. He seems to have a decent relationship with Mistress Meepers, gentry of the Rinaldi, and miss Senora, gentry of the Doloreaux, though whether it is because they understand him or simply give him something to sleep with, I'm uncertain. You can find out a considerable amount by searching through the Constabulary records, where a long list of crimes bearing his name have been filed. Recently, Marquis Alessandro di Rinaldi stripped him of his right to bear arms in public at the request of the Guild Council. It is believed by some he is currently in a relationship with miss Senora, but it could not be confirmed or denied by myself. More information will be added as it is uncovered."<br/><br/> Update 8.9.890 - Miss Senora returned to town after a long absence. She still lingers around Chinco but he seems less smitten than he once was. He spends a good amount of time with a dwarf rabbit named Nan who he's fairly protective of, and has become more social on the whole, even taking to sitting around in the commons conversing with Mistress Meepers of the Rinaldi and other passerby. For a time he was employed with the Bisclavret under their former Quartermaster, mister Brendon, but at some point he was either released from service or he quit. He was just commenting the other day on his need to join an embassy again, though why he would even bother what he knows he will fail at is beyond me.

          <Base:Description type="look">
             "Clover:<br/><br/> Clover LePlow is a horse, but beyond that I cannot recall his physical description. Owner of LePlow jewelers, he worked his way up from a simple commoner to a wealthy merchant and provider of fine goods. He is known for monopolizing the jeweling industry and for being an accomplished fisherman. Aside from this information, which was primarily lent by miss Dasha when I expressed an interest in possibly joining her during my first few weeks here, I have little to no information about him. More will be added as it is uncovered."<br/><br/> Update 8.10.890 - Clover LePlow is a giant, broad-shouldered clydesdale with a smooth roan coat and hazel-streaked chestnut hair. He has short sideburns and round chocolate eyes. After my departure from the Avoirdupois, I wandered about for a time trying to decide what to do with myself. Clover hired me on as a banker so I could make some coin until I found some personal direction, and it was while working for him that I inquired about the Sailors Guild and its inactivity. I admit I was just mostly curious, but he saw my curiosity as an opportunity and arranged a meeting for me with mister Fenton who was, at the time, leading the guild. We chatted for about an hour before he decided he was going to turn his gold ring over to me, which seemed to please Clover a good amount. A vote was initiated that same night and I was placed into the leadership position of the Sailors. Clover is known for treating his people well, and he'll do anything to help you so long as you don't cross him or take advantage of his kindness. His hospitality is both a great strength, and a great weakness; something I have told him on countless occasions. It seems to be one of Sir Matteo's goals to shut him down due to his prosperity, wealth, and control over Docktown, but I must wonder where the common people would be if they didn't have a common leader among them. Many people who otherwise would go unemployed and engage in crime are working honorably in the service of Clover, taking up skills they probably never imagined they would learn - jeweling, guarding, banking, merchanting, nearly anything one can think of. Clover is currently engaged to miss Lianaar, steward of the Bisclavret. A wedding date has not yet been set, but probably will be in the near future.

He is the sort who seems to know everything without having to do any research, and so I find myself often times boggled by his assumptions or supposed truths and irritated at his opposition to everything I say. He seems to have good intentions, though, so one does grit and bear it as one can. I do occasionally take to irking him to make myself smile, which is more than probably impolite of me, but I'm not always known for being polite. He is a good source to approach should people need information on pirates and ports, though why he is so educated on such topics I couldn't begin to imagine.

             a description of Cincin
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             "Cincin:<br/><br/>Cincin is a tiny sickly skunk with with short black fur and waist-length blonde hair. She has short-sighted old-looking eyes that seem to have lost most of their coloring. Guildmistress of Rainbow Rags, a local seamstressing group, she has risen to prominence through hard work and good bargains. She isn't known to have romantic interests, and, in fact, is thought to be married to her job. She is the local senior milliner (she makes hats) and is responsible for giving jobs to clothiers who might not otherwise be able to make it on their own. There was a time when people considered Mistress Meepers to be her rival, but I have only witnessed cooperation between the two, and so cannot confirm. Cincin is known to be a devout follower of S'allumer. More information will be added as it is uncovered.
