Practically an unknown individual until recently, mister Daegan is rumored to be the abusive husband of one miss Kilana. He came to Triskellion only recently to supposedly beat on her for flirting with, or perhaps suiting, Squire Dorcas of House Bisclavret. There was a public scene in the common area in which Squire Dorcas and mister Daegan exchanged words over Kilana before storming out of the area together, presumably to go and battle it out as men feel the need to do. I and a healer trekked to the tournament area, but alas, nobody was around. Squire Dorcas has since seemed to avoid miss Kilana, and her husband, for whatever reason."

She did recently lose an arm in a duel on behalf of gentleman Sattar with an Avoirdupois member, and has been less active in the city since. I personally think it damaged her self-esteem, and why wouldn't it?"

             "Dorcas:<br/><br/>Private Dorcas is a large broad-shouldered panther, with trimmed, silky white fur, and flowing pale blonde hair. He has bright red eyes, a fine nose, and a full mouth, complete with curved lips. Squire to Viscountess Kenina Langston of House Bisclavret, he has been romantically linked to almost every woman in the city, so I won't even bother listing names and wasting my time. He is currently on a self-given quest to successfully chase me, which has proven to be mildly entertaining, if not awkward at times. He is known for his love of sparring, and both his desire and inability to be loyal. In his defense, I must confess I have seen him take up for the weaker side in almost every situation which makes me believe that he has good intentions at heart, but lacks the confidence and the know how to prevent the situations he always seems to be getting himself into. He is someone I will continue to watch closely, whether I want to or not, I imagine."

If you ask him, he will tell you a story of how his family got kidnapped and sold into slavery; thus, explaining his intense dislike of the prominent slaving institution in this city, and of the enforcers in general. People in the business call his kind 'sympathizers' and shun him as ignorant. He spends most of his time in the Newtown library, pouring over books and researching. While not an overly engaging individual as far as small talk goes, he is an excellent tutor in the ways of merchanting and trade, and I'm sure in a vast amount of other areas.
