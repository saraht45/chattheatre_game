          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             General Introductions<br/><br/> The typical introduction, suitable not only on informal occasions but whenever two individuals are introduced, is the mere pronouncing of two names:<br/> "Mrs. Worldly. Mr. Traveler."<br/> If the two names are said in the same tone of voice, it is not really apparent who is introduced to whom; but by accentuating the more important person's name, it can be made clear as though the words "May I present" had been used.<br/> The more important name is said with a slightly rising inflection; the secondary as a mere statement of fact. For instance, suppose you say, "There you are!" and then, "It is raining." Use the same inflection exactly and say, "Mrs. Worldly!--Mr. Traveler."<br/><br/> A man is also introduced, "Mrs. Worldly--Mr. Traveler." A mother introducing a man to her daughter would say, "Mr. Immaculate--my daughter Susan!" or if she is married "--my daughter Susan Smartlington."<br/><br/> Altough the name of a stranger or of the older or more notable person is properly said first, it is not really considered of importance -- except that a woman's name should be said before that of a man, unless the preposition 'to' is used before the woman's name. For instance, if you find yourself saying Mr. Traveler's name first, it is quite simple to make this polite by adding, "May I introduce you to Mrs. Worldly?" Or, with greater friendliness, "Mr. Traveler, I should like to introduce you to Mrs. Worldly."<br/><br/> A woman introduces her husband to friends and talks about him by referring to his first name, and to acquaintances as "my husband." The two names of safety are "my husband" and "my wife," since they are proper no matter to whom you are talking.<br/><br/> It might be emphasized that an introduction prefaced by the phrase "This is," when said with an enthusiastic inflection, can express a warmth and charm that other introductions lack. This can be illustrated in an example of a small boy cub approaching his mother and holding an abashed small girl cub by the hand, radiantly exclaiming, "Mommy! This is her!" In the same way a child would introduce a beloved teacher enthusiastically, "Mother, this is Mr. Wisdom," or, on the other hand, exclaim, "Mr. Wisdom, this is my mother!" -- in the sense of "Behold! this is she--my mother."<br/>

             Forms of Introduction to Avoid

          <Base:Description type="look">
             One should never say, "Mr. Willow, shake hands with Mr. Mahogany" or "Mrs. Oak, I want to make you acquainted with Mrs. Applewood." And do not say "make you acquainted with," nor in introducting one person to another, call one of them "my friend." You can say "my relative" if said person is so, but to pick out a particular person as "my friend" is bad manners, for it implies that the other person is not your friend.<br/><br/> If you are introducing someone to another who is a very special friend, you may say, "Mrs. Oak, I want you to meet Mrs. Applewood." But under no circumstances say, "Mrs. Oak, meet Mrs. Applewood." This last phrase lacks friendliness and courtesy.<br/><br/> Do not repeat "Mrs. Oak! Mrs. Applewood! Mrs. Applewood! Mrs. Oak!" To say each name once is enough, except where it is a foreign one or one that is difficult to pronounce. Then saying this a second time, and slowly, is helpful.<br/><br/> Most people very much dislike being asked their names. To say "What is your name?" is abrupt and unflattering. If you want to know with whom you have been talking, you can almost always find a third party later and ask, "Who was the woman with the grey feather in her hat?" The next time you see her you can say, "How do you do, Mrs. --?" and call her properly by her name.<br/>

             In no way to be compared with the bad taste of total strangers using first names in introductions is the younger generation's practice of introducing all friends by first names. This informality is just as suitable to young adults as to children. Mary Manners, for example, taking a friend to the docks, greets a group of friends with, "Hello, everbody. This is Sarah."<br/> If Mary Manners is accepted as a member of a certain group, she is at once called Mary. To be called Miss Manners announces that she is not a member of the group. Maybe she does not care to join it, maybe they don't want her, but whatever the reason, she does not 'belong.' Obviously, then, introductions among younger groups are titleless.<br/> If Sarah were not really a friend of Mary Manners, she would introduce her--and her own friends as well--by their titles of Mrs., Miss, or Mr., quite as formally as anyone else would. The stranger, by the way, must wait to be called by his or her first name before calling others by theirs. If you are a younger person, you should never call an older person by his or her first name unless you are asked to. Whether older people choose to have those who are a generation younger call them by their first names is a question for them to decide.<br/>

             What to Say When Introduced
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             What to Say When Introduced<br/><br/> Under all possible circumstances the reply to an introduction is "How do you do?" It may be said gladly, casually, coolly, or unthinkingly, as the case may be, and it may be varied in pronunciation or emphasis. "How do you do?" "How d'you do?" "How do you do-oo?"<br/> It does sound limited, but so is holding one's knife and fork and so is drinking coffee after meals. One can often say nothing at all--just smile! True, the same smile can become equally monotonous. At all events, when Mr. Bachelor says, "Miss Single, may I present Mr. Competition?" Miss Single says, "How do you do?" Mr. Competition bows, and says nothing. To sweetly echo "Mr. Competition?" with a rising inflection on the final portion of his last name is not good form. Saccharine chirpings should be classed with crooking little fingers, high handshaking, and other affectations.<br/> People who know better do not say, "Charmed" or "Pleased to meet you." When it is actually true, you can say, "I am very glad to meet you." But you may never say, "I am pleased to make your acquaintance." "Make your acquaintance" is a stilted phrase. On an occasion when you meet someone whom you have heard much about and have long wanted to meet, you may of course say, "Oh, I am so glad to meet you"--or possibly--"to meet you at last!" and then go on to say, "Johnny Apple speaks of you all the time," or whatever may be the reason for wanting to meet this person.<br/><br/> When a young girl is introduced to another who is the friend of an intimate friend of her own, she naturally explains, "Elizabeth has so often talked about you." A girl should say less than this to a boy. She should not tell him how much Elizabeth has talked about him. A boy, on the other hand, may properly tell a girl that his friend is always talking about how wonderful she is. Often the first remark is the beginning of a conversation. Tommy Twotoes is introduced to Mary Manners. She smiles and perhaps says, "Billy tells me you are going to be in Triskellian all winter." Tommy answers, "Yes, I am studying healing with the College of Medicine."<br/> The one occasion when something more than "How do you do?" is necessary is when a friend brings a stranger to visit and tells you, "I have brought Mrs. Blank to visit us." You then reply, "I'm so glad you did!" Then to the stranger, "I'm delighted to see you, Mrs. Blank."<br/>

             Shaking Hands

          <Base:Description type="look">
             Intimate friends, unless they have not seen each other for a long time, rarely shake hands when they meet in public or even when they come in or go out of each other's quarters. The rule that a host or hostess must shake hands with every guest whom they have invited to a party is so ingrained that a well-bred hostess invariably rises and shakes hands with a guest even though she may have seen them but a few minutes before.<br/><br/> Gentlemen always shake hands when they are introduced to each other, even if they have to cross a room to do so. Ladies rarely shake hands when introduced. Boys and girls both follow the example of their fathers and shake hands when introduced, but not when greeting their friends.<br/><br/> When a gentleman is introduced to a lady, she generally smiles, bows or curtsies slightly, and says, "How do you do!" Strictly speaking, it is her place to offer her hand or not, as she chooses; but if he should extend his hand, she as a matter of course gives him hers. Nothing could be more ill-bred than to treat any spontaneous friendliness curtly. In general, it is also the place of the gentleman to whom another is being introduced to offer his hand, and the one being introduced should wait until he does so before putting out his own.<br/><br/> Those who have been drawn into a conversation do not usually shake hands on parting. But for this there is no fixed rule. One is more likely to shake hands with someone whom one finds sympathetic than with one who is the contrary.<br/> Nearly all rules of etiquette are to a degree elastic, and none more so than those governing the acceptance or rejection of the strangers you meet. There is a wide distance between rudeness and reserve. You can be courteously polite and at the same time reserved to someone who does not appeal to you, or you can be welcoming and friendly to another whom you like on sight.<br/>

             On formal occasions, a hostess always stands at the door and the host nearby. Both shake hands with every arrival. On informal occasions they both rise and go forward to greet each guest--a man as well as a woman. The children in the family should rise to receive another child, as well as rise for every grown person who enters the room, and stand until the older people are seated. Grown as well as half-grown members of the family rise to greet guests but do not necessarily shake hands. A woman guest does not stand when introduced to someone at a distance, nor when shaking hands with a friend of her own or with anyone else unless that person be very much older. Should an old lady enter the room in which many other ladies are seated, the others--unless members of the family--do not rise, since seven or eight people getting up at once would produce an effect not so much of politeness as of confusion. But every gentleman stands as long as his hostess or any other lady near him does. He does not sit if any other gentlemen with whom he is talking remain standing. In a cafe, when a lady bows to him, a gentleman merely makes the gesture of rising slightly from his chair and at the same time bowing. He then sits down again.<br/>

          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             When a visitor is ready to leave, he or she merely stands. To one with whom he or she has been talking, the visitor says, "Goodbye. I hope I shall see you again soon," or "I've enjoyed our talk so much." Naturally a woman is less effusive in what she says to a man than in what she says to another woman. And yet she may very well exclaim, "I've been completely thrilled!" if he has told her anything that can be truthfully described as thrilling, but not otherwise. Furthermore, any comment in praise of opinion, or of his achievement, or of an especial work he has done is proper; however, any remark flattering to his personal appearance or charm would be in the worst possible taste. Whatever pleasant remark one person makes, the other person answers, "Thank you." The one who has told of his adventures perhaps answers, "I think you've been very good to listen to me." Or a woman replies to another who hopes to see her again, "I hope so too," although she is more apt to say simply, "Thank you."<br/><br/> In taking leave of a group of strangers--it makes no difference whether you have been introduced or merely included in their conversation--you bow or curtsy slightly and smile a "goodbye" to anyone who happens to be looking at you, but you do not attempt to attract the attention of those who are unaware that you are leaving.<br/>

             When to Introduce

          <Base:Description type="look">
             The question as to when introductions should be made or not made is one of the most elusive points of social knowledge. One occasion that requires introductions is the presentation of everyone to a guest of honor. If one arrives after the receiving line has ended, he must look for this guest and present himself, since it is the height of rudeness to go to an entertainment given in honor of someone and fail to 'meet' them.<br/><br/> At a ball, when an invitation has been asked for a stranger, the friend who vouched for him or her should personally present them to the hostess. "Mrs. Hostess, this is Mr. Attendance, whom you said I might bring." The hostess shakes hands and smiles and says, "I am very glad to see you, Mr. Attendance."<br/><br/> At a very large dinner, people are not collectively introduced. After dinner, men in the smoking room or left at the table always talk to their neighbors, whether they have been introduced or not, and ladies in the drawing room do the same.<br/><br/> According to good manners one person is welcomed by those he comes in contact with because he is well-mannered, and doubtless because he is interesting or clever or sympathetic and personally attractive. Another is rejected by those who find him unattractive and boring. Introductions, whether "correct" or "incorrect," can no more add to the charm of the one than they can lessen the unpleasing qualities of the other.<br/>
