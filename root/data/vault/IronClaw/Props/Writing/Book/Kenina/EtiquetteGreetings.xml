She may be feeling that everything is all wrong, but to "let go" and tell the truth would open up the floodgates disastrously. "Alright, thank you" is an impersonal and therefore strong bulwark agains further comment or explanation.<br/><br/> As a matter of fact, "Alright, thank you" is always the correct and conventional answer to "How are you?" unless there is reason to believe that the person asking really wants to know the state of one's health.

             A Gentleman and His Hat Out of Doors
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             A situation that requires some dexterity is that of a gentleman who stops on a city street to speak to a woman of his acquaintance, in taking his hat and glove off, and in getting his walking stick and cigar (should he be encumbered with either), out of the way. This constitutes a maneuver that needs considerable practice to be done without effort, though the process is easy enough to describe. First he transfers the cigar and stick, if necessary, to his left hand; then he removes his hat and transfers it to his left hand, at the same time gripping the fingers of his right glove and pulling it off. He then offers his gloveless right hand to the woman. This explains why men who use walking sticks prefer those with handles that can be crooked over their left arms. If the gentleman and woman walk ahead together, he puts his hat on; but while he is standing in the street talking to her, he must remain hatless, no matter how cold the wind nor how torrid the sun, for so long as she may be pleased to stand and talk to him. Nor may he smoke. In the country he may very well be bare-headed and also be smoking a pipe or cigar, but in a city street there is no rudeness greater than for a man to stand talking with a woman with his hat on, cigar or pipe in his mouth.

             A Gentleman Lifts His Hat
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             Lifting or tipping the hat is a conventional gesture of politeness shown to strangers only, not to be confused with bowing, which is a gesture used to acquaintances and friends. In lifting his hat, a gentleman merely lifts it slightly off his forehead--by the brim of a stiff hat or by the crown of a soft one--and replaces it.<br/><br/> When walking with a friend who bows to a woman who is a stranger to him, a gentleman lifts his hat without either bowing or looking directly at the woman. This is because it is a fixed rule of etiquette that a gentleman must never stare at a woman.<br/> If a woman who is a stranger drops her glove, a gentleman should pick it up, hurry ahead of her, on no account nudge her, offer the glove to her, and say, "I think you dropped this!" The woman replies, "Thank you." The gentleman should then lift his hat and turn away.<br/> If he passes a woman in a narrow space, so that he blocks her way or in any manner obstructs her, he lifts his hat as he passes.<br/><br/> If he is in the company of a woman anywhere in public, he lifts his hat to a man who offers her a seat, or who picks up something she has dropped, or shows her any other civility. He lifts his hat if he asks a woman a question, and always, if, when walking on the street with a woman, she bows or curtsies to another.<br/> In other words, a gentleman lifts his hat whenever he says, "Excuse me," "Thank you," or speaks to, or is spoken to by a woman. Needless to say, he always takes his pipe or cigar out of his mouth as he lifts his hat, takes it off, or bows. And a gentleman always lifts his hat to his wife when he encounters her, or joins her, or takes leave of her in public, because, if for no other reason, the public does not necessarily know the woman is his wife.

             The Personality of a Handshake
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             A handshake may create a feeling of liking or of irritation between two strangers. Who does not dislike a 'boneless' hand extended as though it were a spray of seaweed or a boiled fish? It is equally annoying to have one's hand clutched aloft in grotesque affectation or shaken violently, as though it were being used to clean a spot out of the air. What woman does not wince at the viselike grasp that cuts her rings into her flesh and temporarily paralyzes every finger?<br/> The proper handshake is made briefly; but there should be a feeling of strength and warmth in the clasp, and one should at the same time look into the countenance of the person whose hand one takes. In giving her hand to a foreigner, a married woman always relaxes her arm and fingers, as it is customary for him to lift her hand to his lips. A relaxed hand is not meant as a wet rag; a hand should have life even though it be passive. A woman should always allow a man who is only an acquaintance to shake her hand; she should never shake his. To a very old friend she gives a much firmer clasp, but he shakes her hand more than she shakes his. Younger women usually shake the hand of the older; otherwise women merely clasp hands, give them a dropping movement rather than a shake, and let go.

The instinct of clicking heels together and making a quick bend over from the hips and neck, as though the body had two hinges, a big one at the hip and a slight one at the neck, and was quite rigid in between, remains in a modified form throughout life. The man who as a child habitually greeted his mother's guests with a bow, when grown makes a charming bow wholly lacking in self-consciousness. There is no apparent heel-clicking, but slow motion would show that the movement is still there.

             The Intentional "Cut"
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             For one person to look directly at another and not acknowledge the other's bow or curtsy is a breach of civility that only the gravest cause can warrant. One must therefore be careful not to confuse poor sight or a forgetful memory with an intentional cut. Anyone whose eyes are not sharp or who is not quick of memory can all too easily fail to recognize good friends as well as newly made acquaintances by whom they were much attracted. This does not excuse the bad memory, but it explains the unintended rudeness.<br/> A "cut" is very different. It is a direct stare of blank denial, and is not only insulting to its victim but embarrassing to every witness. Happily it is practically unknown in polite society.

             People do not greet each other in church, except at a wedding. At weddings people do speak to friends sitting near them, in a low tone. It would, however, be shocking to enter a church and to hear an undignified and unceremonious babble of voices.<br/> Ordinarily in church, if a friend happens to catch your eye, you may perhaps smile, but never actually bow. If you go to a church not your own and a stranger offers you a seat in his pew, you should, of course, almost soundlessly, say, "Thank you." You do not greet anyone until you are out in the vestibule or on the church steps, when you naturally speak to your friends as you encounter them.
