In short, I wish that those whose minds were focused on precise obedience to every precept would instead ask themselves, "What is the purpose of this rule? Does it help to make life more pleasant? Does it make the social machinery run more smoothly? Does it add to beauty? Is it essential to the code of good taste or to ethics?"

Too many of us are likely to assume a wealthy man is, of necessity, a gentleman. Nothing could be further from the truth, since the quality of a gentleman is measured only by what he is and what he does - never by what he has. There is a term known as 'nature's nobleman', meaning a man of innately beautiful character who, though never having even heard of the code, follows it instinctively. In other words, the code of ethics is the code of instinctive decency, ethical integrity, self-respect, and loyalty.<br/><br/> Decency means not merely propriety of speech and conduct, but honesty and trustworthiness in every obligation. Integrity includes not only honesty, but a delicacy of motive and fairness in appraising the motives of others. Self-respect, among many other things, means refusal to accept obligations that one is unwilling to return. This word ~unwilling~ is of importance, since there is no more contemptible person than one who takes all he can get and gives as little as he can. Loyalty means faithfulness not only to friends, but also to principles.<br/>

             "The True Meaning of Etiquette - Page 6<br/><br/> Etiquette, if it is to be of more than trifling use, must go far beyond the mere mechanical rules of procedure or the equally automatic precepts of conventional behavior. Actually, etiquette is most deeply concerned with every phase of ethical impulse or judgment and with every choice or expression of taste - since what one is, is of far greater importance than what one appears to be.<br/><br/> A knowledge of etiquette is of course essential to one's decent behavior, just as clothing is essential to one's decent appearance; and precisely, as one wears the latter without being self-conscious of having on shoes, one who has good manners is equally unself-conscious in the observance of etiquette, the precepts of which must be so thoroughly ingrained that their observance is a matter of instinct rather than of conscious obedience.<br/>
