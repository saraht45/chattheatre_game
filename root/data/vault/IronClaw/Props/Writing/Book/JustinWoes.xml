He itched to honor the poor like the rich, never miserly or greedy. People spoke of his generosity throughout the country.<br/><br/> He lived beside his poorer neighbor whose niece’s loveliness outshined everyone else. The young citizen got to know her, who went by Jennifer, courting her for thirty months. One evening, she told him firmly he could no longer court her if he didn’t wish her for his wife; but if he wished her to be his wife, properly, she would be overjoyed. ''With delight,'' Justin replied, ''I would be proud with you for my wife.'' He promised her he would wed her, then left. He spoke to his mother, telling her how things were.

             He thought like this for months, not knowing how to think otherwise, which might bring him some comfort. He ordered his clothier to sew one costume, spun of wool, dyed deep red, checked with green, the sections of long furs sewn together. The surcote was trimmed in fine suede; the shoes were of the same material, with polished silver buckles. He himself used to be noble looking, but now he sported crumpled fur; frown wrinkles surrounded his eyes. The fine clothes did not comfort him. Fine jewelry did not comfort him. Music did nothing for his mood.

She folded the surcote tightly, holding it close, getting up. She put on her hood, then hurried out of the house. The old crone took note to be sure Jennifer's groom would not return home soon. ''The Light be in your house, my sweet!'' she greeted Jennifer. ''The Light give mercy to the other who died, who troubles my soul. She honored me for so long.''<br/><br/> ''Welcome, Clothier Thyre,'' Jennifer replied. ''Come, sit down.''

Now it is close to midnight. Not one of them wouldn't believe I did not do my will of your body. It would be much better to hide this from those outside our meeting so no one but the three of us will know it.''<br/><br/> Then he drew her closer to him, sliding his fingers over her slender sides, kissing her lips. Jennifer didn't know how to get out of this. It would be better for her to keep quiet. Justin quieted her, holding her, kissing her. Then the two of them together did the thing for which they were brought together.

             In the morning, Thyre got up. She cooked best she could. Then they three consumed their food. Neither Justin nor Jennifer refused. When night fell once more, the old crone set things up in the room for them. The two young ones took much comfort, lying together. They were up throughout the night. With the morning bells, Thyre woke, got dressed, then went to the bed where they were, conversing of their love together. ''Get up, my sweet child.'' she told Jennifer. ''We will go to the church. You must now be reconciled with Luke.''<br/><br/> This upset Justin, but he couldn't refuse her. The old crone told him, ''Let me do this. You will see your beloved once more.''<br/><br/> Thyre brought eight torches, which were over six feet long. Jennifer followed her out of her house with them. They went into the church. Thyre, very wise, told Jennifer to lie down on the ground, forbidding her to move. The old crone turned the eight torches into four crosses. She lit the torches from the church's burning lights, one by one. She put one of the crosses by her crown, one by her feet, one by her right side, then the fourth by her left. Then she went off, telling her, ''Don't worry. Don't move until I return. Until then, just lie there.'' Jennifer replied simply with ''Yes.''

             The old crone went directly to Luke's house, who grieved for his wife. Thyre knocked. He let her enter, hoping for news of his wife.

This night, I woke with the chills. I knew not why. I got dressed, then went to the church, upset. There, I spied your wife stretched out. By her crown, by her feet, by her right side, by her left, there were torches burning. How could you? Should she be there, this pretty one? I'm so upset. Here is this tender child, who ought in the morning to be sleeping here under the bed sheets, whom you send to church! To church! Horrible! The Light bless me.
