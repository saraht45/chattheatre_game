          <Base:Description type="writing">
             Formal greetings are used among those who value propriety, such as nobles, gentry or respectable commoners. For such people, they are particularly important in public and at official social gatherings. To formally greet a superior, bow or curtsy, and if the person is greatly superior, you should do so deeply (eg. bow deeply/lowly/respectfully). <br/><br/> To formally greet a lesser, bow/incline your head, nod, or otherwise acknowledge them. You should NEVER bow/curtsy to a lesser however - even if you hold them in high regard. This has the effect of devaluing your social rank, something your peers may not tolerate! <br/><br/> Teachers/hosts/lecturers/guild leaders and people who have similar prestige are temporarily treated as if they are of higher rank than normally as long as this situation endures. For example, if a knight heads an embassy, a Baronet can bow to him. Or if a thane acts as a hostess, an Esquire may curtsy to them.

Exceptions include if someone is the host of an event or the highest-ranking person of your own house.<br/><br/> How? <br/><br/>You bow/curtsy and ask for leave, saying something akin to “With your kind leave, Sir?” or “Might I have leave, Milord?” They may grant leave explicitly or simply by nodding at you. If they do not answer after a few moments, assume that leave is granted and do not ask again.<br/><br/> When? <br/><br/>Always, if you have been in their company privately. If you have been speaking with the person for more than a few moments in public, also ask leave.<br/><br/> There is NO need to ask for leave in public if you haven't been involved in a conversation with the person. For example, if you visit the courier to check mail, and there is a knight present, you would not ask leave unless you stopped to speak with the knight.

             Some things are improper for everyone, even if people will not be surprised if someone of low statues does it. For example, it is improper to curse in public, but no-one will really be surprised by an old sailor behaving that way. Others are perfectly acceptable for commoners, but not for those of rank, who must be formal at all times. Regardless of rank, public displays of affection are particularly frowned upon, this includes kissing on the lips, petting, and sweet talk. This can make other members of the public particularly uncomfortable, and may be viewed as an infringement of the Virtue of Chastity when two individuals are outside of wedlock.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Things improper for those of rank:<br/><br/> - Not using titles in public.<br/><br/> - Not greeting people formally.<br/><br/> - Display physical attraction going further than the holding of hands and perhaps a kiss on the cheek.<br/><br/> - Acting informally towards anyone, but particularly those of very different rank. For instance, they cannot use nicknames or hug others.<br/><br/> - Being drunk in public, unless at a social event where such is clearly acceptable. Light intoxication is acceptable.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Things improper for everyone:<br/><br/> - Swearing<br/><br/> - Any behavior lewd or sexual in nature - Showing disrespect to any established, legal authority, such as the Church, the Houses or the city authorities.<br/><br/> - Being seriously drunk<br/><br/> - Being loud and obnoxious<br/><br/> (SH Azrael - http://forum.skotos.net/showthread.php?t=75470\&highlight;=church)

             Status in the case of the continents class system is achieved and not ascribed - birth is not the criterion of status, unless you are of Noble blood. Achievements of an individual mostly decide his status within society – and for this reason the correct usage of title and method of address of the utmost importance to avoid offense. If you find it hard to understand how such might cause offence, consider this. You are a Freedman, your own person. Free to do as you wish. How would you feel if someone addressed you as ‘Slave’. The implication is that they perceive you as of lesser rank than the respect you are entitled to. It is an insult to your very being!<br/><br/> Each social class has its own status in the society, and as such is expected to act a certain way, the Baron that regularly fights in bar brawls is unlikely to demand the respect from his peers - demotion and removal of his peerage could result. After all status is associated with prestige – no one wishes for their rank to become tarnished by the actions of a single member. This is a guide to help inform the reader avoid  potentially embarrassing faux pas in addressing a superior with the wrong honorific.

             Bound persons<br/><br/> slave – a person who is the property of, and wholly subject to a higher ranking individual, would be addressed directly by name or ‘slave’. The lowest rung of the feudal ladder.<br/><br/> serf – one bound to the land of their owning Lord or Lady. If his lord sold the land, the serf is traditionally passed on to the new landlord. A serf would be addressed directly by name or possibly  as ‘peasant’ by the Nobility.<br/><br/> Commoners  - The most numerous class within Triskellian’s society. A freedman and yeoman will hold no land, but are theirs own person. The correct honorific for these classes are Mister / Miss / Mrs depending on marital status and sex.<br/><br/> Typically addressed as Mister / Miss / Mrs---\> burgher \& thanes - <br/><br/> The "titles" of Mister and Miss should be the basic prefix given to an individual to identify gender and act as a default, when one is uncertain of the appropriate address. If you work with, but are not close friends with an individual, you may greet them as "Mister Browne" or "Miss Browne" or simply "Mister" or "Miss". Likewise, when you are addressing or signing missives it is important to begin with a proper salutation; "Dear Mister Browne" or "Dear Miss Browne". Likewise, signing it as such is proper; "Sincerely, Mister Browne" and so forth.<br/><br/> Master and Mistress The allocation of the honorific ‘Master’ or ‘Mistress’ is not an intrinsic one, but is a title bestowed upon an individual due to their expertise within their chosen profession; eg. A Master Carpenter might name himself ‘Master Browne’. Alternatively if members of the Royal Family or Nobility call someone Master or Mistress, it is widely regarded as a show of favor.

             Gentry<br/><br/> The upper echelons of the social hierarchy consist of two entities, the gentry and armigerous gentry. Any male member of the Gentry may regard himself as a gentleman, in a special sense mutually understood between hereditary members of the class. The biggest distinction between the gentry classes, is that the armigerous gentry are granted a coat of arms. Members of this class may be addressed as Esquire regardless of gender. Gentleman or gentlewoman is also an acceptable term of address. <br/><br/> Knights (or low nobles) <br/><br/> A knight is a prominent position within the social order. Knights will have been having been “knighted” in an official ceremony for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity – this is often done when a child is around 13 if they are noble born. <br/><br/> Knights are given fiefs of land by their Baron in return for either recognition of service to the House, or military service. A major role of the Knight is to protect the Baron and his family, as well as the Manor, from attack – though this is less of an issue within the walls of Triskellian. The Knights will keep as much of the land as they wish for their own personal use, and distribute the rest amongst serfs to work. A knight is entitled to ‘high justice’, that is, they may only be tried or detained by other Nobles and not commoner police, when being held accountable to the law. The correct honorifics include Sir or Lady Browne, an alternative is ‘my liege’ but this is only used by individuals in direct service to a Noble, ie in the same House.<br/><br/>

          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="look">
             Peers are Recognized as one of the ruling class elite. Peers can only be tried for crimes by other Peers, or those of higher rank, in addition they may dispense “high justice” to Knights, through their office of ‘divine right’.  Titles from peerage are largely hereditary titles, in that they are passed from father to eldest son, these ranks include;
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="writing">
             Baronet/Baronetess <br/><br/> A baronet or the female equivalent, baronetess is usually the holder of a hereditary baronetcy. A baronet/ baronetess in return for the land they had have been granted by their House or Nobility, are expected to serve on the royal council, pay rent and provide the House with Knights for military service when required. A not too uncommon request was that a Baronet provide lodging and food for high ranking officials and their entourage. A baronet is addressed as 'Sir’, ‘Lord Browne’ or ‘Baronet Browne’ while a baronetess would be addressed as ‘Lady’ ‘Dame Browne’ or ‘Baronetess Browne’. My liege is also acceptable for individuals in direct service to a Noble. In writing, the two titles may also be abbreviated to Bart and Btss respectively.<br/><br/> Viscount/Viscountess<br/><br/> A viscount and viscountess is said to hold a ‘viscountship’ or ‘viscounty’. Individuals of this rank are granted the right to wear a coronet (a small crown consisting of ornaments fixed on a metal ring) of rank, bearing 16 silver balls around the rim. Like all heraldic coronets, it is mostly worn at the coronation of a sovereign, and formal occasions and events. A viscount(ess) also has the right to bear his coronet of rank on his coat of arms, above the shield. The style of a viscount may be either a place name, their surname, or sometimes, a combination thereof. Therefore a viscount may be addressed as ‘The Viscount Browne’, ‘The Viscount Bridgeport’  or ‘The Viscount Browne of Bridgeport’ , and a viscountess The Viscountess Browne’, ‘The Viscountess Bridgeport’  or ‘The Viscountess Browne of Bridgeport’. Other honorifics include Sir or Lady Browne, or an alternative is ‘my liege’ but this is only used by individuals in direct service to a Noble, ie in the same House.<br/><br/> Earl/Count/Countess<br/><br/> Earls had authority over their own regions and right of judgment in provincial courts, as delegated by the king. They collected fines and taxes and in return received a "third denarii", one-third of the money they collected. In wartime they can be expected to offer support to, and even lead armies into battle. An earl/count/countess are addressed as their names sake, and as with Viscount/viscountesses may have a title that can either originate from a placename, or from their surname. In either case, he or she is referred to as ‘Lord Browne’, and his ‘Lady Browne’<br/><br/> The eldest son of an earl, though not himself a peer, is entitled to use a courtesy title, usually the highest of his father's lesser titles (if any); younger sons are styled ‘The Honourable [Forename] [Surname]’, and daughters, ‘The Lady [Forename] [Surname]’. Young Master May also be acceptable.<br/><br/> Landgrave/Landgravine<br/><br/> The title refers to a count that has feudal duty directly to the Holy Church of S’allumer. Their jurisdictions typically stretches over quite a considerable territory, and are sometimes referred to as “provincial counts”. Landgravine refers to the wife of a Landgrave, or a female who exercises the office or holds the rank in her own right.<br/><br/> Landgrave/ Landgravines are not subservient to an intermediate power, such as a Duke or a Bishop. The title is given to Earls and Counts in order to make them directly dependent on the king and a Royal Family. Landgraviate refers to the rank, office, or territory held by a landgrave, whom may be addressed as Landgrave and Landgravine, ‘Lord’ and ‘Dame’ or ‘Sir’ and ‘Lady’<br/><br/> margrave/margravine<br/><br/> Margrave (man) and Margravine (woman) are the titles for the hereditary nobleman and noblewoman with military responsibility for one of the border provinces of a kingdom. The greater exposure of a border province to military invasion provided the Margrave with military forces greater than the forces of the other lords of the realm, thereby indicating superior noble rank. As a military governor, the margrave often was responsible for a territory greater than the province proper, because of the border expansion subsequent to royal war.<br/><br/> The correct honorific for a Margrave or Margravine is 'Sir’, ‘Lord Browne’ or ‘Margrave Browne’ while a Margravine would be addressed as ‘Lady’ ‘Dame Browne’ or ‘Margravine Browne’. My liege is also acceptable for individuals in direct service to the Noble<br/><br/> Marquis/Marchioness<br/><br/> A marquess or marquis is a nobleman or noblewoman of hereditary rank, the distinction between a Count and a marquess was that a marquess's land, called a march, was on the border of the country, while a count's land, called a county, often wasn't. Because of this, a marquess was trusted to defend and fortify against potentially hostile neighbours and was thus more important and ranked higher than a count. The correct honorific for a Marquis or Marchioness follows the same pattern as previous peerages; 'Sir’, ‘Lord Browne’ or ‘Marquis Browne’ and ‘Lady’ ‘Dame Browne’ or ‘Marchioness Browne’ for Marchionesses. My liege is also acceptable for individuals in direct service to the Noble<br/><br/> Duke/Duchess.<br/><br/> A duke (male) or duchess (female) can be either a monarch ruling over a duchy or a member of the nobility, and is the highest rank below that of the direct lineage of one of the Royal Families. The titles of Lord and Lady are bestowed Dukes and Duchesses, however ‘Your Lordship’, ‘My Lord’ or ‘My Liege’ is acceptable for males and ‘Your Ladyship’, ‘My Lady’ or ‘My Liege’ for Duchesses, can be used by individuals in direct service to a Noble, ie in the same House

          <Base:Description type="look">
             Prowess is to seek excellence in all endeavor expected of a knight, martial and otherwise, seeking strength to be used in the service of justice, rather than in personal aggrandizement.
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="writing">
             Seek excellence in all endeavors expected of a knight, martial and otherwise, seeking strength to be used in the service of justice, rather than in personal aggrandizement.<br/><br/> In chivalric terms, prowess is a complex concept that encompasses a variety of the attributes a knight is expected to have. It is often described as great strength, hardiness and skill, as well as the courage and determination that must inform success. Without prowess a knight, no matter how gracious or courteous he might be, could not truly be considered an example of chivalry.<br/><br/> There are degrees of prowess inherent in all activities,  however the greatest measure of prowess is found in a knight whose energies are continually directed toward finding better ways to be of service to others — as role models, as leaders, as administrators and as champions. Greater prowess, is found in greater actions of service, and a knight who does not seek prowess lives a shameful life.<br/><br/> Men of prowess know how to strive toward the most worthy course of action, whether in relation to deeds of arms or in relation to other forms of behavior appropriate to their rank. Then they reflect on, inform themselves, and inquire how to conduct themselves most honorably in all circumstances. This they do quickly and gladly, without waiting for admonitions or exhortations.<br/><br/> The pursuit of prowess is not a road leading to personal glory or acclaim, but to a greater sense of spiritual enrichment and pious respect. The talents, skills or wisdom we use in seeking excellence throughout our lives are gifts from God, and thus humble gratitude, not vanity or arrogance is a fitting attitude for even the most accomplished knight. Without graciousness, faith and humility, prowess will simply melt away just as certainly as snow melts away when exposed to the powerful heat of the sun.<br/><br/> You don’t need to be a placid, self-effacing romantic to be chivalrous. You can live by the code of chivalry and still be a spirited, successful competitor seeking ever-higher standards of excellence in any intellectual, professional or athletic endeavor. Men today, like those worthy knights of old, must realize that we cannot excel if we work only for vain, selfish goals — the noble standard of prowess reminds us that excellence must always be combined with service and faith. We can live up to the knightly ideal of chivalry only when we see that excellence and contribution go hand in hand, and he who accomplishes more is of greater worth in everything he does.

             Justice is born in the way we treat one another: polite, friendly, and concerned enough with everyone's well-being, including our own, to be fair in all our dealings. This sets the tone for just relationships. Knights are expected to always seek the path of 'right', unencumbered by bias or personal interest. Recognize that the sword of justice can be a terrible thing, so it must be tempered by humanity and mercy. If the 'right' you see agrees with what others see, and you seek it out without bending to the temptation for expediency, then you will earn renown beyond measure.<br/><br/> Justice is not limited to punishing wrong-doers. It is a concept that refers to fairness, treating people in a just and honest way in everything we do, it directly relates to understanding of right and wrong, truth and goodness. It is the attempt to transform the chaos of random behavior within a shared moral consistency. The civility this offers is not some lofty idea. It's enduring appeal makes sense to people of all cultures, as it has throughout the ages. However, Chivalry did not invent justice - Chivalry embraces it as one of its natural, major tenets.<br/><br/> Justice flows naturally from an honest quest for truth. One cannot be a knight errant without knowing this. It is this foundation which requires us to protect the weak, honor all women, and defend the good. Nothing less than the highest truth dictates our agenda.<br/><br/>

A Knight should be known for their unwavering commitment to their House and ideals of the Holy Church of S’allumer. There may places where compromise is expected; loyalty is not amongst them, especially within the Avoirdupois House.

             For many, Courage is bravery in battle, or bravery in the face of danger. Courage is looking adversity of any sort in the eye, and standing to face it. Courage is standing up for one's beliefs, in the face of danger, and in the face of peer pressure. Courage is doing what is right, rather than what is easiest.<br/><br/> Being a knight often means choosing the more difficult path, the personally expensive one. Be prepared to make personal sacrifices in service of the precepts and people you value. At the same time, a knight should seek wisdom to see that stupidity and courage are cousins. Courage also means taking the side of truth in all matters, rather than seeking the expedient lie. Seek the truth whenever possible, but remember to temper justice with mercy, or the pure truth can bring grief.

             A knight is always faithful to his word and deed. Faith under the code of chivalry deals with a knight’s integrity and trust. It is possibly the most straight forward of all of the Knightly virtues, having faith means that a knight has faith in his beliefs and unwavering devotion in the teachings and beliefs of the Holy Church of S’allumer, for faith roots him and gives hope against the despair that human failings create.

Tell the deeds of others before your own, according them the renown rightfully earned through virtuous deeds. In this way the office of knighthood is well done and glorified, helping not only the gentle spoken of but also all who call themselves knights.<br/><br/>Humility is not thinking less of yourself, it is thinking of yourself less, it is a spirit of self-examination, selflessness, and the giving of respect. It is the courage of the heart necessary to undertake tasks which are difficult, tedious or unglamorous, and to graciously accept the sacrifices involved. A Knight will hold reverence for those who have wisdom and those who selflessly teach in love. Giving credit where credit is due; not unfairly glorifying one's own self. Being faithful to promises, no matter how big or small they may be.

             Is generosity to those in need, is a highly admirable virtue indeed. Largesse is sharing with others within the prudent bounds of one's resources, largesse used in this way counters gluttony. It also makes the path of mercy easier to discern when a difficult decision of justice is required. When looked at in these terms, Charity may well be the superior virtue.<br/><br/> Largesse is positively not rooted in monetary considerations. For many of us, we best display Largesse by sharing our time with others, teaching what we know, inviting others to our homes to allow them to use our tools to make armor or clothing or soap.

             Knights seek to live each virtue as they were meant to be lived, accepting no compromise in their commitment. Franchise is the virtue of practicing the other eight virtues without any though of profit or personal gain. Franchise is the purest motive, selflessness in every action - not for the reason of personal gain but because it is right.<br/><br/> It is vitally important to maintain, in all ways possible, the appearance and station of a Knight. As you wish to live, you must live. Know that you, and those who serve in fealty to you, are a reflection upon your fellow Knights, and keep their honor safe with your own.

             There were only two main ways in which a person could become a knight for an individual not born of a noble family. This can be through charity, service to profession, religion or a Great House, or by recognition by their superiors. The second is the sequence of knighthood typically undertaken by the son of a noble. A knights training will include (though his may vary between Great Houses):<br/><br/> Training:<br/><br/> When a boy or girl is 12 years old, he was sent to the neighboring manor or castle where he was trained as a page. He will spend most of his time strengthening his body, wrestling and riding drays. He is also taught how to fight sword and shield. All the while the young man would also be taught more civilized topics. He/she would be taught to read and write by a school master, this may include a second language.<br/><br/> Apprenticeship:<br/><br/> At the age of fifteen or sixteen, a child becomes a squire in service to a knight. His/her duties included dressing the knight in the morning, serving all of the knight’s meals, caring for the knight’s dray, and cleaning the knight’s armor and weapons. He/she followed the knight to tournaments and assisted his lord on the battlefield. A squire also prepared himself by learning how to handle a sword and shield, and quickly and effectively dress in a suit of armor.<br/><br/> The Dubbing Ceremony – The Knighthood:<br/><br/> When the squire is around twenty, a squire could become a knight after proving himself worthy. A lord would agree to knight him in a dubbing ceremony. The night before the ceremony, the squire would dress in a white tunic and red robes. They will then fast and pray to the Light for the purification of their soul. A chaplain would bless the future knight’s sword and then lay it on the chapel or churches altar. Before dawn, the knight to be will take a bath to show that he/she was pure, and they will dress in their best clothes. When dawn cames, a priest will take confession, a S’allumnun contrition rite. The ceremony takes place in front of family, friends, and nobility. The squire kneels in front of the lord, who taps the squire lightly on each shoulder with his sword and proclaims him a knight. This was symbolic of what occurred in earlier times. In the earlier middle ages, the person doing the dubbing would actually hit the squire forcefully, knocking him over. After the dubbing, it is traditional to hold a great feast with music and dancing. A young man could also become a knight for valor in combat after a battle or sometimes before a battle to help him gain courage<br/><br/> Knighthood is a class culture, cherished and jealousy guarded by the knightly caste. On battle fields a code of chivalry evolved that tempered anger and fury with mercy. It has created ways of turning the grim business of fighting into something more acceptable. Knights adhere strongly in the code of chivalry, it denotes the ideals and practices considered suitable to be a noble. During knighthood, the individual will promise to defend the weak, be courteous to all women, loyal to their king, and serve the Light at all times.

Much of their power stems from positions with members of the houses, taking private confessions from high nobility as well as leading guild members grants them a constant and remarkable say in things.<br/><br/> In certain matters (such as heresy) the church law is more significant than the Don's laws. The church is also capable of performing resurrections from those that they wish to favor, giving them a great deal of influence. Anyone excommunicated from the church is essentially cut off from "good" society, providing two very effective methods for maintaining the church's influence against those that would act against them. The Church adheres to a social structure removed from that of the lay system, these ranks are as follows.<br/><br/> Clergy – serf/freedman-- Any other Clergy not recognized as a full Priest of the church belongs within this grouping. These can be clerics, squires, and healers who have decided to take the path of Clergy through dedication to the Holy Church of S'Allumer. They have no oaths that bind them, nor vows that constrict them, but are upstanding members of the community who desire to become a Priest, or a devout member of the Church. These members can be tried by criminal law and do not afford a Church Trial. Much like a normal commoner, the correct honorific for address is Mister / Miss / Mrs depending on marital status and sex. A group of Clergy may, regardless of sex, may be referred to as clergymen.<br/><br/> Acolyte - yeoman-- An Acolyte is the rank designated to a yeoman who has not been ordained, they may perform simple ceremonies and services with the permission of a Presbyter. More traditionally they would be assistants to a Deacon and aim to raise awareness to the Church’s values. In greeting an Acolyte, you may greet them as Acolyte, followed by their surname where it is known.<br/><br/> Monk – Burgher-- A monk may be a person who decided to dedicate his life to serve the in the name of the Light, and live his life in prayer and contemplation. They would be in charge a single aspect of a church in a city, such as a Youth Ministry program, a choir, sermons, or counselling, etc. They are directly accountable to the Presbyter. They can only be tried by Prelates or above and only removed from office by the Prelate or above. They can perform blessings, weddings, funerals, exorcisms and are directly in charge of learning doctrine, and all about the community in which they live to spread the will of The Great Light. The correct honorific for a Monk is ‘Brother’<br/><br/> Pastor  - Thane-- A Pastor in its simplest sense is a lay member of the church appointed to assist the running of church on a regional basis, therefore a city may fall into the jurisdiction of numerous Pastors. Members of this social rung maybe referred to as ‘Pastor’<br/><br/> Deacon – Gentry-- A Deacon is an ordained minister within in the Church of S’allumer. They are generally associated with the delivery of  the daily services held by the church, as well as preaching of the Twelve Virtues of S'allumer and Tenets of Helloise. This is a deeply traditional class, and as such is on an equal footing with those of the Gentry.  The correct manner with which to address an individual with this rank is as either ‘Deacon’ or ‘Father’<br/><br/> Priest  or Presbyter - Arm. Gentry-- A priest or Presbyter is a person fully ordained to perform the sacred rituals of a religion, especially as a mediatory agent between the Light and the people. They also have the authority or power to administer religious rites including confessions. They would commonly be referred to as ‘Reverend Father’ or ‘Your reverence’<br/><br/> Prelate - Knight-- A prelate is a high-ranking member of the clergy who is an ordinary or who ranks in precedence with ordinaries, and therefore has ‘ordinary power’ to execute the church's laws. Members of this class and higher may not be tried within the normal criminal system, and are granted the right to a Church Trial in its place.Prelates have the power to reside over the trial of other Clergymen who are beneath them, the ability to teach and guide those below them, recommend those beneath them for advancement, and promote Ordained Ministers to Presbyters. A Prelate would be in charge of a city, or an section of the city's clergy, directly beneath the Bishops. They can only be tried by Bishops or above and only removed from office by the Master Capitulars or above. They can preform blessings, weddings, funerals, exorcisms and are directly in charge of monetary means, trading, and supplies within their sect. The correct honorific for such a figure is ‘Most Reverend Father’ or ‘Your reverence’<br/><br/> Bishop - Baronet/baronetess-- A bishop is an ordained or consecrated member of the S’allumern clergy who is generally entrusted with a position of authority and oversight. Bishops have the power to preside over trials of other Clergymen, the ability to teach and guide those below them, recommend those beneath them for advancement, and promote Presbyters to Prelates. A Bishop would be in charge of a region, or an entire city's clergy, directly beneath the Master Capitulars. They can only be tried by Master Capitulars or above and only removed from office by the Holy See. They can perform blessings, weddings, funerals, exorcisms and are directly in charge of the ebb and flow of information within their sect. (IE: lessons and what not, approving who learns what and how much.) The traditional title granted to a member of this class is ‘Bishop’ and may be addressed as ‘Right Reverend’ ‘Your Lordship’ or ‘my Lord’ in conversation<br/><br/> Exarch – Baron/baroness-- The Exarch is essentially an ordained governor with extended authority over a province or extended area tasked with overseeing the work of spreading the word of the Light. An integral part of this rank is that Exarches are expected to be the presiding ‘judge’ in Church Trials – remaining impartial and delivering the Light’s justice. The associated  title given in this rank is ‘Exarch’, but they may also be referred to as Your Lordship’ or ‘my Lord’.<br/><br/> Vicar general - viscount/viscountess-- A vicar general is the highest official ranking member of the Church, after the diocesan bishop or his equivalent in canon law. They will preside over a single district or city, they exercise ordinary executive power and are a figure of administrative authority – their vote is used to breaks ties, and his word is final as granted by The Great Light. Their title is shortened to Vicar, and are also referred to as Your Lordship’ or ‘my Lord’.<br/><br/> Archbishop – earl/count/countess-- An archbishop is a bishop of higher social rank, above that of the four orders of deacon, priest, presbyter, and bishop. Accordingly, a person does not become an archbishop by ordination (the process by which individuals are consecrated). Instead the rank of archbishop is conferred on by a number of bishops who are not ordinaries of the city or region. They hold the rank not because of the See that they head, but because it has been granted to them personally ("ad personam"). Such a grant can be given when someone who already holds the rank of archbishop is transferred to a neighbouring See. Traditionally given title is ‘Archbishop’, and they are addressed as ‘Your Grace’.<br/><br/> Metropolitan - landgrave-- The rank of metropolitan bishop, or simply metropolitan, pertains to the diocesan bishop or archbishop (then more precisely called metropolitan archbishop) of a metropolis; that is, the chief city of a Calabrian province or regional capital. Before the establishment of patriarchs, metropolitan was the highest rank in the Church of S’allumer. The Metropolitan is awarded the honorific ‘Archbishop’, and they are addressed ‘Your Grace’.<br/><br/> Primate – margrave/margravine-- From the Old ‘primus’ meaning first. The rank pertains to a bishop possessing superior authority, not only over the bishops of his or her province, like the metropolitan, but over several provinces, cities and metropolitans. Primatial rights and privilege typically include the right to convoke and preside over national councils, to crown the sovereign, to hear appeals from the metropolitan and even episcopal courts. The correct honorific for a person baring this title is ‘Primate’ and are addressed as ‘Your Grace’.<br/><br/> Cardinal – marquis/marchioness-- A cardinal is amongst the most senior prelates, and are usually an ordained Bishop, and ecclesiastical prince of the Church of S’allumer. The duties of the cardinals include attending the meetings of Colleges and Universities, and making themselves available individually or in groups to the pope if their counsel is requested. Most cardinals have additional duties, such as leading the church within a city or region (diocese) or running a department of the Holy Church of S'allumer. A cardinal's other main function is electing a patriarch whenever, by death or resignation, the seat becomes vacant. A member of the church baring this rank is called a Cardinal, and their style of office (honorific) is his, her or your ‘Eminence’<br/><br/> Patriarch - duke/duchess -- The highest-ranking of all of the Bishops of S’allumer, the patriarch is the Church’s official that over sees the governance of the church, and the state of society, especially where people are not yet organized into a nation, but consist of independent tribes, clans or families. Patriarchs consecrate and supervise the work of the archbishops and bishops within their jurisdictions. These are referred to as a Patriarch, and addressed as his, her or your ‘Eminence’ (Based upon SH Azrael - http://forum.skotos.net/showthread.php?t=66127\&highlight;=church)

             Every year, missionaries go abroad to spread word of the miracle, and to teach how the Light of Ascension may save all those who follow in its steps. Triskellian is the home of the Penitents of S’allumer, and the city observes all the high holy days of the religion, The Tenets of Penitence are: <br/><br/> Ascension:<br/><br/> If one lives a pure life, and if one learns and accepts the teachings of Penitence, then after death one will be united with the Healing Light that is in all living things. Those souls that Ascend after death will be one with the purity of all-being, a joy that surpasses any experience one an have in this life <br/><br/> Asceticism:<br/><br/> People are, by their nature, "worldly" and subject to worldly appetites. That is merely a weight that prohibits people from rising towards the healing light. Only by understanding how the four points of the material world (air, earth, fire, and water) link to the four points of the spiritual world (courage, serenity, wisdom, and understanding) can one truly shuffle off the prison of mortal coil and walk the shining path into the light of truth and beauty <br/><br/> Pancreationism:<br/><br/> Where there is life, there is S'allumer. All being comes from the generative light of S'allumer <br/><br/> Monoteism:<br/><br/> There is only the Light of Ascension. Other gods are false gods; belief in them will deny oneself the glory of Ascension and is an act of Heresy and high treason, those found guilty of such acts can be punished by being burnt as the stake
