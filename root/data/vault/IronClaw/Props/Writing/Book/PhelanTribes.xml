          <Base:Description type="look">
             "The Eastern Clan: Tuath na Oirthir<br/><br/> The Oithir have settled furthest inland of any of the Phelan, since the Bisclavret declared themselves a separate people. All Phelan agree that the territory this clan controls is the most fertile in their entire demesne. Many outsiders agree, too, and as a result this land is witness to most of the border-skirmishes and battles that the Phelan must fight against the Noble Houses of Calabria to defend what is theirs. When the Bisclavret openly denounce the Phelan they are referring to the Oithirr in particular -- either it is the frequent border-raids, or it is the resentment that such good land "goes to waste" when presided over by "primitive" Phelan. The Doloreaux are only slightly less belligerent, possibly because of their empathy with the pantheistic practices of the Phelan. The folks of Triskellian only rarely concern themselves with the Oirthir, since they live many leagues away. Even more seldom does any Avoirdupois venture far enough west to encounter with Oithir, or any Phelan at all. It is rumored that the Oithir are on good terms with the Doloreaux's long-standing enemy the Chevernise, but nothing has been proven.<br/><br/> Of all the lands controlled by the Phelan, the lands of Oithir are the most desired. The forests grow thick and lush with stout wood, next to fish-stocked rivers. Indeed, the people who live here might enjoy an easy life...were it not that they were bordered on the northeast by the Doloreaux, and Southeast by the Bisclavret, two noble houses eager to expand territory.<br/><br/> By his keen wits and his skilled advisors, King Esras holds dominion over Oirthir as did his father, and father's father before him. His greatest difficulty is keeping a large population of Fianna in line -- in theory, these warriors represent the standing forces to keep out the foreign warriors; in practice, when left to their own devices they form bandit-gangs and prey outlanders. Like any good king, Eras stands behind his subjects. When strange nobles come to his door to protest roving bands of Phelan who rob their border-towns and carriages, he is quick to deny any knowledge of such activity...and then is quick to add he has clear proof of outlanders attacking his own "peaceful" subjects.<br/><br/> Nowhere else in Phelan lands can one find greater evidence that these wolves believe that "the gods are everywhere." Standing stones, carved trees, and revered wells can be found everywhere. Perhaps it is the lushness of Oirthir's territory that has inspired them to give so many offerings to the spiritual world. Despite all these trappings, Druids are rare. The few that are present are usually from other Clans, as the Oithir devote little time to "academic" persuits.<br/><br/> Oithir has the largest standing army. Most are Militia-- farmers who train in the arts of war when they can. Many are Fianna, the "warrior-knights" who are full time fighters -- and since they do not support themselves with honest work, they often turn to banditry.<br/> Oithir lands are some of the most choice in Calabria. Frequent rainfall keeps the land green and lush. The summers are often nice, although high humidity is not unknown. Warriors of Oithir have been known to use the fog of the Valleys to mask their numbers."

All Phelan agree that the territory this clan controls is the most fertile in their entire demesne. Many outsiders agree, too, and as a result this land is witness to most of the border-skirmishes and battles that the Phelan must fight against the Noble Houses of Calabria to defend what is theirs. When the Bisclavret openly denounce the Phelan they are referring to the Oithirr in particular -- either it is the frequent border-raids, or it is the resentment that such good land "goes to waste" when presided over by "primitive" Phelan. The Doloreaux are only slightly less belligerent, possibly because of their empathy with the pantheistic practices of the Phelan. The folks of Triskellian only rarely concern themselves with the Oirthir, since they live many leagues away. Even more seldom does any Avoirdupois venture far enough west to encounter with Oithir, or any Phelan at all. It is rumored that the Oithir are on good terms with the Doloreaux's long-standing enemy the Chevernise, but nothing has been proven.<br/><br/> Of all the lands controlled by the Phelan, the lands of Oithir are the most desired. The forests grow thick and lush with stout wood, next to fish-stocked rivers. Indeed, the people who live here might enjoy an easy life...were it not that they were bordered on the northeast by the Doloreaux, and Southeast by the Bisclavret, two noble houses eager to expand territory.<br/><br/> By his keen wits and his skilled advisors, King Esras holds dominion over Oirthir as did his father, and father's father before him. His greatest difficulty is keeping a large population of Fianna in line -- in theory, these warriors represent the standing forces to keep out the foreign warriors; in practice, when left to their own devices they form bandit-gangs and prey outlanders. Like any good king, Eras stands behind his subjects. When strange nobles come to his door to protest roving bands of Phelan who rob their border-towns and carriages, he is quick to deny any knowledge of such activity...and then is quick to add he has clear proof of outlanders attacking his own "peaceful" subjects.<br/><br/> Nowhere else in Phelan lands can one find greater evidence that these wolves believe that "the gods are everywhere." Standing stones, carved trees, and revered wells can be found everywhere. Perhaps it is the lushness of Oirthir's territory that has inspired them to give so many offerings to the spiritual world. Despite all these trappings, Druids are rare. The few that are present are usually from other Clans, as the Oithir devote little time to "academic" persuits.<br/><br/> Oithir has the largest standing army. Most are Militia-- farmers who train in the arts of war when they can. Many are Fianna, the "warrior-knights" who are full time fighters -- and since they do not support themselves with honest work, they often turn to banditry.<br/><br/> Oithir lands are some of the most choice in Calabria. Frequent rainfall keeps the land green and lush. The summers are often nice, although high humidity is not unknown. Warriors of Oithir have been known to use the fog of the Valleys to mask their numbers."
