To the north will be servants quarters and then coming around to the east hall will be baths and privvies.\\r\\n\<br\>\<br\>\\r\\nA formal staircase will rise up to the west as you enter, into a proper Foyer on the first floor, leading into a parlor or sitting room so that any guests might be greeted there, rather than being allowed to enter into the living area. This will seem more proper and also be good security for safety.\\r\\n\<br\>\<br\>\\r\\nFrom there out to a hall which again will overlook the open garden in the center with grand arches and a marble railing, so no one falls over the side of course.. the hall there will be an open balcony all the way around, with doors leading west to guard quarters and the armory, to the north broad chapel doors leading to a well appointed chapel, flanked by a room for clergy, the house chaplain and perhaps any healers we might have within the house.\\r\\n\<br\>\<br\>\\r\\nThe east hall of course will be a wide training area with maple floors and various furnishings to aide in the guards training. She happened to show me a sample of sugar maple. The sample itself looked marvelous. I can only imagine the outcome of numerous planks creating the floor.\\r\\n\<br\>\<br\>\\r\\nShe described that from the parlor you would be able to ascend to the upper floor where again the open balcony will surround the open garden, always a view of this area. Each hall will have noble rooms, beside each, household rooms, handmaidens, Reeve and so on will have their private rooms close to the nobility rooms. Baths in each room and parlors for visitors so we need not have them in the private sleeping areas.\\r\\n\<br\>\<br\>\\r\\nEach room will also have doors to step out onto private balconies, and a short spiral staircase to step up to a fine roof patio. A separate stairwell in the outer hall will allow visitors and guards to go up as well.\\r\\n\<br\>\<br\>\\r\\nAnd of course there will be the guardhouse upon the roof. Which will be a small lightweight building so the guards will have shade and shelter from the rain and elements, but quite simply that.\\r\\n\<br\>\<br\>\\r\\nI had questioned her about the stairwells leading from the balconies to the rooftop.. and if it could prove as a security hazard. She had mentioned that each stairwell will have an ending gate which will of course need a key.\\r\\n\<br\>\<br\>\\r\\n\<i\>The subject of the individual balconies was thereafter debated, since it might also be requested that there be more pragmatic stairs to lead down to the garden and ground floor below rather than up to the roof.
