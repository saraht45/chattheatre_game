             A group of ten male and female performers make up the chamber music orchestra, a group of musicians finely dressed in velvet of a midnight blue color accented by silver silk. There are four violinists, their finely-crafted string instruments stained in dark tones of rich mahogany. Off to the right of them is a man with a large drum, his drum sticks sanded to a smooth golden finish. Seated along the front of the group is a group of three flautists with richly-stained instruments held at the ready. Standing before the ensemble is a thin, willowy man with a maestro's baton.
