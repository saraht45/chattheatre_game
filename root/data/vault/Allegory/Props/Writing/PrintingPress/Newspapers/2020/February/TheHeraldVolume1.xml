         X[S] Lothario was placed before the citadel on February the 13th 1600. When Lothario entered the execution area he threw a red silk ribbon to a group of onlookers. A tense energy pervaded the area and within minds of those in attendance. King Dominic rose his voice to Lothario and the crowd asking how he plead. Lothario with a mixture of bravery and great fear admitted to the crimes and plead guilty. King Dominic then decrees with his articulate words, "For your crimes, by the will and testament of the Crown, you are sentenced to death!King Dominic also warned "May your death be a warning to all those who would so act against the Crown of Italy; our justice will always prevail!"\\\&lt;br/\\\&gt; Father Mattissimo gave Lothario his final rite  and the executioner swung his axe. Lothario before meeting his death yelled "The pigeon also flies! Like the dove...always home. The axe then separated his head from his body. This led several in the crowd to believe yet another attack was imminent and began to arm themselves. Two massive crowds began to form one in support of the king and another angry with the execution of Lothario. The crowds were dispersed by the Royal Guard.

It was a family owned business passed down from generation to generation. After Rosalina could no longer work, and the business was passed to her son Decimus. The business had to close due to unforeseen circumstances and the smell of baked goods have been sorely missed.\\\&lt;br/\\\&gt; The English Manor used to be home to a giant market. Crafters,Entertainers, and customers alike would flood to this spot to enjoy the market. Children could often be seen playing and running in their mirthful youth. Wares of any kind were displayed with a near limitless variety. It was one of the city's spots that came alive with the roar of others. The history behind the city is not something to be forgotten and shows the roots of blending culture.\\\&lt;br/\\\&gt;\\\&lt;br/\\\&gt;
