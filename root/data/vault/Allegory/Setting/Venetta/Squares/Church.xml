             Overlooking the canal to the south, this plaza is ringed on the remaining three sides by large buildings that create a pocket of seclusion in contrast with the open expanse of the cobbled ground beneath your feet.

A bridge leads to the southwest while a smaller road continues to the northeast.

             Standing taller than any of the other buildings in this area, the church is a gleaming white structure bedecked with two levels of columns all decorated with ornate statues of angels that add lush texture to the facade of the building. The width of the structure's pale entrance matches that of the transepts, giving it a substantial footprint in this small, secluded piazza.
