             opulent dining room
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             Spacious and flooded with light, this opulent dining room is awash in pale rose hues and ornate details that are grounded by the rich tones of the parquet floor underfoot. Coffered ceiling tiles with detailed plaster floral motifs are accented by pale rose and subtle gold leaf accents that are picked up by the detailed frescoes that are set into panels along the walls. Arched windows fill the western wall, dressed in rose-dusted gold brocade drapes that pool in sumptuous folds on the diamond-shaped parquet details of the floor. Placed in the center of the room atop a bronzed bisque carpet is an oval dining table that seats twelve, the pale gold tablecloth accenting the gold embroidery of the cream colored upholstery of the chairs. Overhead, large gilt chandeliers dripping with glass crystals add even more light to the already bright space.<sbr/><sbr/><show-exits/>
