Floral patterned brocade wallpaper covers all four walls above a waist-high mahogany bookcase that surrounds the entire periphery of the room, the rich wood tones mirroring those found in the ornately carved desk that stands prominently at the center of a gold and burgundy persian rug. Chaises in sanguine-hued velvet stand to the southeast of the desk, the upholstery matching the plush armchair that stands opposite. Sheer silk drapes in a contrasting pale gold color flank not only the windows, but also the doors, the fabric pooling at the floor in sumptuous folds.<sbr/><sbr/><show-exits/>
