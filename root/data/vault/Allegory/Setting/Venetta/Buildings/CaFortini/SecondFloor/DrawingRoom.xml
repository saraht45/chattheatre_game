             Almost immediately catching the eye, a large lion's head fountain stands prominently against the western wall, the cadence of running water dulled by the sumptuous array of lush fabrics that surround the room in folds of raspberry colored crushed velvet. In complement to the dark color of the ceiling drapes, a low-slung couch upholstered in burgundy lines the entire eastern wall beneath a large picture window that overlooks the street outside. Small accent tables are tucked in all four corners of the room, the pure white painted wood standing in stark contrast to the plush wine carpeting underfoot. Overhead, a gilt bronze chandelier hangs from the center of the ceiling, the swooping drapes emanating from this point to pool in folds along the corners of the space.<sbr/><sbr/><show-exits/>
