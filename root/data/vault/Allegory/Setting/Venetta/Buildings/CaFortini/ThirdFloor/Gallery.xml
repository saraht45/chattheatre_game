             stately art gallery
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             Massive landscape paintings and ornately detailed scenes of religious iconography fill the walls of this massive space in an array of rich colors and textures, the oil paintings all encased in engraved gilt frames. Every inch of space is covered in artwork, the scant glimpses of the ash grey walls behind the paintings neutral to bring more attention to the artwork itself. Intricate parquet wood flooring underfoot is polished to a high-gloss finish, the ruddy wood tones tempered by the neutral colors of the Turkish rug that covers the majority of the floor space. Chaise lounges in charcoal foliage patterned brocade upholstery are accented by bronze colored pillows, the seating arranged around the space to allow guests the opportunity to sit before the largest of the paintings to admire the details. Chandeliers overhead illuminate the room in golden candlelight that glints off the gilt surface of the frames and shimmer in the glossy varnish on the canvas.<sbr/><sbr/><show-exits/>
