             extravagant library

          <Base:Description type="examine">
             Massive in scale and filled with bookshelves that line the entire northern and southern walls as well as the floor space in between, this lavishly decorated library is filled with the perfume of books and beeswax candles. Candelabras and chandeliers in gilt bronze illuminate the honeyed hues of the oak bookshelves, the colors complemented by the amber and bronze floral motifs painted on the frescoed walls to the east and west. Large leaded glass windows fill the frescoed walls, each one outfitted with upholstered windows seats that are dressed in golden bronze sheer silk drapes that hang from the gold-accented oak cantilever ceiling overhead to pool in sumptuous folds along the parquet floor. Small accent rugs in similar golden hues reduce the echo of footsteps in the cavernous space, the rich multicolored leather bindings of the books further dulling any sound.<sbr/><sbr/><show-exits/>
