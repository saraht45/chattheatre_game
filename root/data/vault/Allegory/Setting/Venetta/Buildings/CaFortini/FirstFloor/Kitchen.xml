          <Base:Description type="examine">
             Though utilitarian in purpose, this kitchen space is well-appointed, dual oversized fireplaces commanding the majority of the eastern wall alongside a brick oven and a large-scale cast iron wood stove to allow for the preparation of large banquets. A pair of massive work tables line the center of the space, the area around them free from clutter and the space beneath serving as storage for large pots and pans. A rack overhead is flanked by large chandeliers that provide light to the work surfaces with additional sconces lining the space between the windows overlooking the canal to the west, underneath which two large wash basins and a smaller work table are arranged.<sbr/><sbr/><show-exits/>
