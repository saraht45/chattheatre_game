             Surrounded by windows to the south and west, this airy space is awash in tones of blue-grey and cobalt that are brightened by the addition of white furnishings. A table and chair set is nestled into the southwestern corner, overlooking the canal to the south as well as the road to the west through the cobalt drapes that flank each of the windows. The floor is equally light in color, spanned by a cream-colored carpet that accents the light color of the furnishings and centers the attention primarily on the views that comprise the majority of the wall space.<sbr/><sbr/><show-exits/>
