             Opulently decorated and overwhelming in size, the nave of the church is an arresting array of vividly detailed murals that cover the walls and ceiling amongst a myriad of rich stone columns and towering statues of angels and religious figures. The overall color palette is awash in serene tones of deep blue and pale silver all accented by burnished gold that accents the rich umber tones of the floor. Two long rows of lustrous mahogany pews create an aisle down the center of the church that draws the eye inward and upward to the stunning architecture of the altar that overlooks the entirety of the space. Windows set high on the walls infuse the altar with a glow from above, illuminating the lush sculptural accents that decorate every available space in, around, and above the spiraling columns that flank the sacred space.<sbr/><sbr/><show-exits/>
