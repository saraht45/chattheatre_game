             the Tribunale di Rinascita
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine">
             Massive in size, the Tribunale di Rinascita is an expansive and excessively opulent space used to conduct all matters of judicial importance to the realm. Ornate gilt double doors dominate the eastern wall, contrasting the mirror-finish porcelain blue marble tile covering the floor underfoot. A grand staircase of pristine white carrera leads up to a raised balcony where the judge sits to oversee the proceedings below. Matching the marble of the dais, two large tables immediately facing the balcony are reserved for the prosecution and defense, respectively. Immediately behind them, two equally massive tables, each accommodating up to ten people, comprise the juror's tables. The remainder of the space is home to four long marble benches for the audience to sit on while spectating the proceedings of the court. Flanking the grand staircase, open archways lead northwest and southwest. Overhead, the ceiling is painted with an elaborate mural of a partially cloudy blue sky with gold-leaf sun rays emanating from the western portion of the ceiling and radiating down the western wall behind the judge's seat. The remaining walls are covered in ornately carved marble panels, each accentuated with gold and silver leaf that reflects the light from the ornate silver chandeliers hung at even intervals throughout the room. <sbr/><sbr/><show-exits/>
