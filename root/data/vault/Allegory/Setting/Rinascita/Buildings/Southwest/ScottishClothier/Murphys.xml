             Murphy's Imports is a modestly decorated shop, with a counter to the north for sales transactions, and a seating area to the south. The seating area has two solid wood tables to either side of a red leather couch, with a matching chair. A corner shelf is tucked neatly in the northwest corner of the room. A bordered cherry-red and burgundy area rug takes up most of the floor in this space, it looks quite used. Two windows in the east wall let in a bit of light as well as a few oil lamps that are built in. You can see a few wooden toys and dolls left carelessly around the room.<sbr/><sbr/><show-exits/>

             The gray stone eastern wall was laid on a base of peastone gravel which fills a twenty-one inch trench. The larger blocks are placed at the bottom and the lesser stones set upon those. For stability, the higher stones slant towards the center, therefore it is thinner near the ceiling. All the cracks and crevices are filled with minor stones and gravel to complete the wall and prevent light or weather from filtering through. The wall is approximately ten feet in height. There are two arched windows.
