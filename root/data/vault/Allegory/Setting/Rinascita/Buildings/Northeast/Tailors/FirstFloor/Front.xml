Most of the studs are of the same width, though some have slight curves or uneven surfaces. The arch-braces rise from some of the larger posts, and curve slightly 'inward' as they rise to support the ceiling beams. Between the wooden posts and braces are panels of black walnut, securely nailed into place. These panels are recessed about half an inch beyond the surrounding wooden framing. The wall is about eight feet high.

             The close-studded, half-timbered northern wall is constructed of black walnut posts (the studs) and a few diagonal arch-braces, joined with mortises and pegs, all perfectly flat and square. The studs are of the same width, though some have slight curves or uneven surfaces. The arch-braces rise from some of the larger posts, and curve slightly 'inward' as they rise to support the ceiling beams. Between the wooden posts and braces are panels of clean, whitewashed plaster, laid over laths or wattle-work covered with clay mixed with horse-hair. These panels are recessed about half an inch beyond the surrounding wooden framing. The wall is about eight feet high. An open doorway has been centrally built, leading into the work room.
