             the eastern wall
          </Base:Description>
          <Base:Description type="examine-bright">
             The close-studded, half-timbered western wall is constructed of dark, unpainted oak posts (the studs) and a few diagonal arch-braces, joined with mortises and pegs, and all less than perfectly flat and square. Few of the studs are of the same width, and some have slight curves or uneven surfaces. The arch-braces rise from some of the larger posts, and curve slightly 'inward' as they rise to support the ceiling beams. Between the wooden posts and braces are panels of rough, whitewashed plaster, laid over laths or wattle-work covered with clay mixed with horse-hair. These panels are recessed about half an inch beyond the surrounding wooden framing. The wall is about eight feet high; a glass sliding door is set in the middle of the wall.

             The close-studded, half-timbered western wall is constructed of dark, unpainted oak posts (the studs) and a few diagonal arch-braces, joined with mortises and pegs, and all in various stages of decay. Few of the studs are of the same width, and many have slight curves or uneven surfaces. The arch-braces rise from some of the larger posts to sturdily support the ceiling beams. Between the wooden posts and braces are panels of rough, whitewashed plaster, laid over laths or wattle-work covered with clay mixed with horse-hair. These panels are recessed about half an inch beyond the surrounding wooden framing. Dead center of this wall is a reconstructed fireplace complete with a restored chimney. Hanging above it is a decorative portrait of a crowd gathering for mass.

With a smile and a faint blush she thanks him, and begins conversing indecisively about meal options.
\|A petite slender woman moves in and out of the group of people, gathering empty cups and dishes as she passes. \| A petite slender woman briefly disappears through the kitchen door before returning with more plates of hot food.\}
